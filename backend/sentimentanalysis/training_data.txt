i would rate the wall as the best of my cd collection which crosses 500 to datethis brilliant album has sold more than 23 million copies worldwide and is a strong seller even today even though it is a double albumi would strongly urge you to have this to know the greatness of this british band who are the masters of psychedelic rock|1
this album is hugeit has 26 amazing songsthe only place ive seen more on one album is on a greatest hitsif you have listened to the whole thing through you might think that roger waters had gone crazyhe talks about worm lordsbut the album is still a masterpiecethis is a must have for anybody|1
half the song wondt play rite skippedjumped to the next songplayed 1 verses and stopsince ive got 2 write 5 more words liked the original the remastred needs some remastering|0
about half the songs are brought down a notch or two from the hardrockin style we normally hear  and i love hearing geddy harmonize with himself|1
anyone who has ever heard the original cast album produced by bmi with elly stone mort shuman shawn elliott and alice whitfield will never be able to listen to this terrible remake gone is the mystic haunting quality beauty of the original sound quality is harsh and the perforances are dry and emotionlessi dont know if the original album is available anymore but if you can find it i wouldnt settle for this one it does not do justice to brels music|0
why do people fuss over this dated pop group michael jacksons thriller blows every beatles album away as true pop music genius only music arty farty music critics continue to ramble on about their music for the need of something to say|0
all of them were part of the great magma but here this is as far as possible from the genius of vandertopreturn to uumlduuml wuumlduuml at once |0
flyleaf have a thunderous powerful sound that suits the songs passion and emotion heavy guitarbased rock juxtaposes with secret weapon lacey mosleys sweet vocals and she can roar with the best of them as well every song is fabulously catchy not a weak one in the bunch my favorite is the instant classic im so sick the five acoustic versions of selected songs show how diverse the band is by not just rearranging them but reimagining them the dark gothy dvd included kicks this is a band to look out for|1
i enjoy listening to brian regan his sense of humor is not only funny but enjoyable and true  i recommend this cd for sure|1
appealing to adults as well clever funny lyrics that charm the whole family my kids loved it and now i buy this classic for the next generation|1
my wifes brother sent us a manilla envelope in the mail about three years ago  inside was a copy of this cd without any explaination about what it was and why he had sent it  i had never even heard of brian regan  we put it into our car cd player and five minutes later around the my name is brian bryathe number 7the letter q time i had to pull over to the side of the road  i almost got in an accident because i was literally crying  by about 15 minutes into the routine i had a new favorite comic  i became a huge fan of his 2004 dvd i walked on the moon his appearances on comedy central his comedy showcase bits his tenure at a california radio station the name of which alludes me at the moment and seeing him live we had to drive 4 hours each way and it was still worth it  but this cd trumps allbrian is the best observational comic including jerry seinfeld who has an obvious similar style  in fact at the hight of his powers around the time he stopped his series jerry asked brian personally to open for him which he did for a while  thats beside the point his observations about having to make the car noises for mechanics why the fishing show has writers growing up in a family with 8 kids and their activites which included staring at the sun and bringing a cup of dirt to the science fair are as funny to think about as they are to hear  his commentaries are both spot on and hysterical  his voices and yelling are the icing  example his friend that would bring the same solar system every year to school screaming the big yellow one is the sun  so whats the best part about brian  hes clean  in a business that basically thrives on cursing drugs and envelopepushing immorality you quickly realize how refreshing his approach is and how difficult it must be to not fall back on what everyone else is doing  with a focus on family he seems like a good person too another comedic rarity  this cd is an absolute classicoverall  10 out of 10|1
on this date i could get no sound on the tracks why amazon this is not the only conniff album i had trouble with|0
as with so many bands before them and so many bands to come as soon as one person in the band gets a successful idea that propels the band to more stellar heights their ego inflates to staggering proportions and they begin to believe that they are the band this is the first album where roger waters giant planet sized ego becomes publicly apparent they had been struggling internally since dark side apparently waters takes all the credit except for one song this is hard to believe as wright has always been a major writer and contributer to the music of pink floyd and its difficult to believe that roger alone came up with all these keyboard parts and arrangements they are just too beyond his scope as a musician most likely he bought out wrights credits gilmour too is just given the one credit and removed from all the rest a very unlikely reality from this fans perspective except for the little acoustic bits that open and close the album the rest is very dense and unaccessable the lyric are pedantic and dreary the sheep learn karate and beat up the dogs indeed the music does grow on you over time but lyrically it fails drastically using orwells animal farm as a backdrop to display his juvenile understanding of politics and the ways of the world waters succeeds in sticking his head right up his own arse where it has apparently been dwelling ever since not a bad album for the music but if youre into the concept and the lyrical content youll be disappointed if youre looking for something intelligent i guess the others were fed up arguing with waters about his greatness  a real leg end in his own tiny mind|0
i really liked caravan headlong wreckers wish and garden the most the other songs are pretty much borderline unless youre a diehard rush fan its a keeper cd|1
slash and myles kennedy combine to make  a kick ass cd  the vocal really complement slashs shredding  highly recommend this|1
englands fab bore released this album in 1969 during which the beatles were falling apart at the seams due to creative financial and legal issues  come together sounds fake and everything else is tired  who would buy this when you have pink  get her new album instead|0
im sorry but this is an awful awful attempt by the marketing department of due south to earn a little bit more cash maybe its not my type of music but i only really listen to the theme tune possibly the one by  sarah mac and nobodys girl its much more grungie than the first album  which i own which is definately not my scene but that said if you like  that type of music go for it in fact you can have my copy only  joking|0
actually if i were going to go beyond the idea of a concept album with the wall i would be more inclined to call it an oratorio similar to jethro tulls thick as a brick or passion play rather than a rock opera like jesus christ superstar or the whos tommy  that is because the over riding unity of the songs in the wall is thematic rather than narrative in nature  the bleak double album is roger waters meditation on the walls human beings build up to ensure their survival in the postmodern world  it is also something of a departure from the groups previous albums most notably the dark side of the moon and wish you were here it that the groups signature cosmic rock sound is giving way to some more traditional pop music sensibilities  the compelling electronics and other special effects that had become key components of pink floyds music and which put dark side of the moon on the chart for literally years now takes a back seat to the themes and lyrics although there are still some choice moments such as when gomer pyle shows up on nobody homethe story such as it is concerns a rock star named pink no subtlety here boys and girls who is disgusted with the lesser human being he has become as a result of his celebrity  the key song in the album is comfortably numb cowritten by lead guitarist dave gilmour which is one of the classic rock songs about alienation although obviously the title begs to have it labeled a song about intoxication by the drug on your choice  but the context for lyrics such as you are only coming through in wavesyour lips move but i cant hear what youre saying is clearly about the despair of being disconnected from humanity  it is also a lament about the lose of childhood which remains in waters vision the time when we are at our best as human beingswhen i was a child i caught a fleeting glimpseout of the corner of my eyei turned to look but it was gonei cannot put my finger on it nowthe child is grown the dream is gonei have become comfortably numbthe music for comfortably numb is both operatic and eerie a paradox that is nonetheless accurate  the relentlessly depressing picture of a rock stars life would have you worrying about the mental health of roger waters if it were not for the suspicion he is writing as much about the life in general and former pink floyd lead guitarist and main songwriter syd barrett as it is an attempt at catharsis by waters after spitting on a fan during a concert for daring to applaud during an acoustic number  i always was struck by the start of mother with one of the very best examples of a caesura with the extremely effective pause between the first line mother do you think theyll drop the bomb and the second mother do you think theyll like this song  there is a world of meaning in the vocal silence there that i have never forgottenthere are two pitfalls to the wall  the first is that pink floyd released a rare single with another brick in the wall part 2 which mean that school children rebelling against the system now had something to sing throughout the year while waiting for the end of the year to do alice coopers schools out  consequently in the popular consciousness the wall was boiled down to the following potent lyricswe dont need no educationwe dont need no thought controlno dark sarcasm in the classroomteachers leave them kids alonehey teachers leave them kids aloneall in all its just another brick in the wallall in all youre just another brick in the wallyet taken in its totality it can hardly be said that the primary purpose of this doublealbum was an attack on the educational system in england  in song after song the character is blaming others for his troubles so it is not surprising that teachers end up on that list  but the success of the single made it seem this was what the whole thing was all about  for that matter there are more songs concerned with the threat of nuclear destruction mother goodbye blue skies than education  by the time you through waters paranoia over great britain becoming fascist run like hell the whole indictment of education seems like just another well you know what which would be the point rightthe second concern is that the disparity between the highs and lows on this album are rather substantial  it is rather like sitting through an opera and some of recitatives eg goodbye cruel world to get to the arias eg hey you  the best tracks on this album are as pretty good but you still have to sit through some less than stellar sections eg one of my turns  the loose narrative is not enough to help us connect the dots and i suspect it is only by really getting totally into the album and trying to achieve consubstantiality with the creative vision of roger waters that you can really make sense of it all  this is why the production values of the wall as performed by pink floyd in concert tended to replace the psychological dimensions of listening to it in the dark in your roomthe key thing here is that there are moments in the wall that match its ambition  the sum is greater than the total of the parts but there is certainly nothing wrong with that being the case|1
the case and the insert were as represented  the cd inside it was fats domino  i wrote to the company about the error and never heard back a word from them  it was a small purchase but i really needed it  what a disappointment|0
the wall is the greatest album and ranks after dsotm as amongst the greatest everhighly recommendedfive stars|1
actually i am a pop  rock fun i like black music from 50s 60s 70s 80s from musical point of view i dont like hiphop or rap except some songs like the message gmf nothing special|0
this must be a bootleg if it even exists  not listed on kmfdms website|0
the opera came without a libretto and was therefore useless to me i had to scramble around to find an online libretto and would have returned the cd but had  so little time to when i was to see the opera i would not recommend amazon for opera purchases unles they are more specific about if librettos are included or not|0
i have enjoyed this album mulitple times i will always be partial to their older stuff though its a good concept theme album again|1
obviously revolver is a great album but this particular one was warped when it came in the mail very disappointed|0
rush has been and still is such an inspiration to musicians and music lovers like meupside out their commitment to high level music is still evident on this record as well as what sounds to me like more of a soundgarden and black sabbath influence which ive never heard in their music previouslymy only complaint is that the album is mastered too hot and tends to distort in almost any system i play it in especially on my ipod i wish theyd checked the sound in ipod headphones before putting it to printtwang|1
christian meditation is a perfect tool for those who seek to stay in the church but pursue a mystical life the roman catholic and eastern rite churches do have a meditative and mystical legacy that is not as well known as its legalistic doctrine this is a great cd to own if meditation is your thing and you want to stay true to your faith at the same time|1
pink floyds the wall is a classic the bands most ambitious masterwork  later used as the soundtrack from the hit 1983 film the wall is a mix of songs that is among pfs very best  this time around instead of going for psychedelic rock as in dark side of the moon pf goes more for odd eerie wacky pieces  and yet these songs tell a story like no othersthe albums grand opening piece is in the flesh which compares the album to a wall that the following songs alone can break  the second song begins the story of a mans life the thin ice about the simplicity of young childhood  then we seep into the first part of one of pink floyds most popular songs another brick in the wall which eventually became one of the most played radio hits of the 80s  the happiest days of our lives moves us on to the mans childhood where he was placed in a school full of abusive teachers  which then seeps into the best part of another brick in the wall part 2  mother tells us about the young mans worries which he speaks to his mother goodbye blue sky is something of an obituary for childhood empty spaces finds the man trying to conceal his horrible memories but he cant and therefor we find ourselves hearing about his young lust  then we learn about pinks temper towards his wife in one of my turns which leads to his wife leaving in dont leave me now  another brick in the wall then finishes with part 3 and the first disc closes with goodbye cruel worldthe second disc is considerably different from the first it focuses on life behind the berlin wall  it opens with hey you then moves on to is there anybody out there and nobody home in which a man tries to hide from the authorities in charge of the wall  vera talks about pinks seperation from his lover on the opposite side of the wall bring the boys back home is about pinks desire to have his old friends back and then comes comfortably numb one of pink floyds greatest pieces  pink has become numb to anything going outside the wall contrary to popular belief the song is not a druggie song  then theres the show must go on and two live pieces  in the flesh and a good version of run like hell  the ending of the second disc sounds as though it was inspired by queen not at all like pfs traditional compositions  finally the album closes softly with outside the wallthe wall can be taken in a few different directions is it about drugs  is it about the berlin wall  or is about a troubled drugaddicts horrid memories  the lyrics are excellent making some terrific songs unfortunately the songs just dont flow as on pfs earlier albumsall in all you may like the wall or you may not  in my opinion the wall is one of the greatest albums of all time and among pink floyds best  to sum it all up the wall is flawed brilliance|1
look i just cant get past the production values of this release it is unlistenable if youre going to go the duration this nick guy is not the producer for rush not sure what he was thinking but you gotta think the three band members must have heard this jumbled mess and agreed to release it vapor trails was bad but their last effort seemed to be on the right track now were right back in the hole so no im not going to give it another 6 spins at an hour plus a pop dont have time to waste and i just couldnt take it i dont know if terry brown was a genius but if he was there must have been alot of then running around in the midseventies the concepts of dynamics space tone clarity all forgotten or dismissed there are some well produced records out there mostly in the jazz world so i think we still have the technology to do it too bad and without more listens i wont be able to get used to geddys terrible vocals rangebound with no melody and scattered and unfocused songs btw i am a big fan going back to 1974 and this does not knock them off their pedestal they did great things but all things must and do pass|0
ralph bakshis illfated 1978 animated version of lord of the rings is univerally loathed by tolkien fans and nonfans alike sadly its soundtrack by leonard star trek iv rosenman is a part of the problem while its been praised as superior to howard shores compostion due to its character themes and avantgarde style i wasnt able to percieve any coherent themes at all and avantgarde just means dissonance in this case its too loud too bold the orcsong at the end is simply ridiculous much like the badly rotoscoped orcs that sing itbottom line this is a worthy companion to bakshis film see peter jacksons version instead and buy howard shores soundtrackboth are infinitely better than the version represented here|0
music thats as heartfelt and resonant as a chewing gum commercial jingle|0
why so many people love this album so much i am a huge pink floyd fan but this album doesnt rate as a great album let alone a great floyd album  i cant think of a pink floyd album much worse than this  nothing really than roger waters wailing and whining about stupid bs  the lyrics are very uninspiring  while there are a couple of songs on here worth listening to there just is not enough to warrant listening to this entire album dont let someone fool you into thinking this album is anything special|0
im not claiming this is floyds best album but when it first came out i kicked back put on the earphones and was absolutely stunned by waters lyrics and gilmores crying guitar it was de ja vue all over  again when the cd came out i can understand someone who is not a floyd fan  not likeing this album but if your into floyd its a must|1
good cd for brian regan fans the youtube clips show his funniest bits its nice to see him in person on the pc or on a dvd he is a funny guy|1
top to bottom musically and lyrically this clearly is the best rush album since the classic 19741982 era for the band  this concept album really doesnt have a weak moment on it and as a whole stands up with anything in that classic period  while i jumped on the rush bandwagon in the late 70s i admit i started wavering around grace under pressure when the band became heavy with synths and by the time hold your fire came along i had pretty much written them off  somewhere around counterparts i started listening to the bands albums again and have continued to buy each of their discs and with the exception of vapor trails and maybe feedback have in time come to appreciate each of their albums this one is different this one has more immediacy to it  all the songs are great the concept of the album is great and the thing just flows like a great album shouldthe first 3 songs immediately were standouts that grabbed me  after playing the remainder of the album a few times the story line clicks and the songs just jump out all are memorable  the closer which is the garden is fantastic  the playing feels stronger more energized and the songs standout over some of the prior releases  kudos on the production to nick rakulinecz for getting the most out of the band exceptionalits nice to look forward to the upcoming tour and hoping they will play a heavy dose of the new album instead of awaiting the same old hits that are rehashed over and over on classic rock radio  a masterpiece|1
the wall deluxe packaging digitally remastered being pink floyds 1979 release is a concept album that included the hits another brick in the wall part 2  run like hell and comfortably numb this album holds a special place in my heart as i sang another brick in the wall part 2 at highschool the booklet is very strange with hard to read lyrics and avantgarde art that is hard to understand still and all this is just as good as other rock classics such as sgt peppers lonely hearts club band  highway 61 revisited and pet sounds 55|1
this cd does have authentic native american indian music but many of the songs just repeat with different titles there are 2 songs that are copied 4 times each  2468 and 35713 and 2 songs which are copied twice 1517 and 912  better bet for your money is authentic native american music|0
this is not a review of the wall i love the album and consider it one of the greatest ever made this is a review of the disks i received for some reason the second disk is the beatles live at the bbc now i have nothing against the beatles i wanted the wall though the disc has the wall art on it and lists the songs from the wall but i get the beatles|0
i am a preschool teacher of 30 years frank letos music is an integral part of my teaching  language development is increased as well as lots of fun time for music is a must have|1
this cd contained some bad music overall but some of the really good ones were excellent so i guess i wouldnt recommend anyone to  buy this cd|0
very bad recording  disliked singers voices  if youve heard the play you wont want this  make sure you listen before you purchasegave mine away to my local library|0
sammy and the band hit a homerun with this one its a great listen i really like the first chickenfoot cd but a lot of the music sounded the same dont get wrong the music was very goodthis cd is so much better than the first one some of the songs sounded like vanhagar which i liked i hope they continue to make more great musicif you like sammy hagar its a must have|1
this will go down as an epic rush album if you were at the last tour the first two song will be familiar with a little change but as good as ever then they take you through an incredible melodic and metal journey with every member of the band taking their skills to the next level at one point you feel like the bassline owns the album then alex pops in with stream that blows your mind all being done as neil continues his greatness if youve enjoyed rush in the past especially mid 70s to late 80s rush that era is back and dare i say better|1
this cd is very funny and familyfriendly i could really relate to a lot of the things he talked about on the cd i would recommend this cd to anyone needing a good laugh ill probably be purchasing some more to give for gifts|1
brian regan is the funniest cleanist comic ive ever encountered i have been to see him live at the improv in dallas tx many many times and each time i bring friends ive listened to this cd many many times  in fact i have 2 copies just to ensure i can listen to it whenever i want i highly recommend this album|1
bernstein would normally seem to be a slam dunk  i wish i had read the earlier reviews of this elgar composition rendition as several are right onthere are other performances that are far more brilliant and exciting than this one  who would expect bernstein to interpret this work with so little inspiration  it is draggy and frankly rather boring and we will select another for our collection so we dont have to agonize through this one again  shame on you lenny|0
this sounds like something youd hear on the lawrence welk show  i guess i was expecting something much more natural sounding than it is|0
after seeing this selling on line for as much as 25699 the 9999 for this purchase here at amazon is a bargain with what you get from the coffin box set 9999 is still a little more than what i would have normally paidmetallica really missed out on giving their fans a great coffin box set release with only 2cds a dvd a tshirt and some other odds and ends it came up a little short the download code for a live concert would have been better suited with an exclusive 2cd release in the box setwith this release being only limited to 2000  its still not a bad purchase for 9999  highly unlikely this with be lower in pricefor now my coffin box will remain sealed if i buy another one in the future i may open that one up|1
i am a died in the wool keaggy fan owning virtually every known lp and cd  and having played and performed many of his songs over the years  but true  believer is not true to the keaggy cause  the use of very heavy  compression gives most of the songs a brittle hissy sound that has you  wanting to turn them down then off after about 30 seconds  thats a shame  because some of the worst sonically offending songs  are not bad in  themselves needing only competent remixing  and there are two or three  gems tucked in betweenall written exclusively by keaggy and all among the  quieter songs whose max volume level doesnt rise high enough to be  squashed by a ham fisted compressor  for a collector you have no choice  you must buy it or fall from the ranks of fanatical  but if youre  thinking about buying your first keaggy album dont start here  a friend  of mine told me he had a keaggy album and didnt care for him  guess which  one he purchased  a little guidance and he is now on the path to  discovering that one of the worlds greatest guitarists is a true believer|0
bought as a gift for a friendfound out months later that there were numerous stickers on the actual album cover that didnt come off wo damaging the coveryeah i know it is a plain white coverbut still|0
talented harpist and creative arranger kim robertson has a way of making even the most familiar tunes artful interesting and uniquely her own  her simple but pleasant arrangements here are rich warm and delicate taking full advantage of her instrument and her abilities  the celtic in this albums title reflects the fact that robertson plays a celtic harp rather than the source of the carols themselves  her musical material is predominantly english or french and predominantly familiar to modern ears though the lesser known selections from the middle ages and renaissance are lovely additions  unnamed flute and bell players contribute in the background of several of the pieces but the harp remains the focus  robertsons delicate and artful celebration of the holiday season continues on celtic christmas ii where she is joined by cellist virginia kron  for other gentle holiday cheer featuring harp try a winters night by ensemble galilei or ancient noels by ensemble galilei and maggie sansone|1
i listen to a lot of soundtracks and while i loved the movie and the opening music the soundtrack is a bit boringthis cd is not really worth it|0
the audio is terrible  at first its so soft you cant hear it and when you turn up the volume the next section is too loud and you have to turn down the volume  you shouldnt sell this item|0
there is nothing to be said about this cd that could fully explain its greatness track by track there truly is no bad songs all the songs are geniusly written by roger waters my favorite songwriter david gilmours guitar work is awesome the riffs from songs like in the flesh young lust and empty spaces are such a driving and brutal force it almost empowers roger waters lyrics but not quite waters bass playing on this album stands out among the other floyd albums to me also it is in full force on this album richard wrights keyboard playing further enhances this genius album as does nick masons exquisite drumming 5 stars for sure|1
alchemy is one of my alltime favorite recordings the reason i am looking for another copy of it is that i played it so much the tape is shredding from being listened to so much there is something here for everyone i highly recommend it to anyone looking for the best in new age music|1
i was a little disappointed in that there too many vocals on the cd when i expected more intrumentals  might recommend another cd by tso|0
i was looking for a hits album from al and saw this a couple years ago for 5  these dont sound like original recordings or anything close to them  the version of i have but one heart is particularly disappointing  he struggles through it have speaking it and have singing it  id stick with the originals such as the capitol collectors|0
i have read the many praising reviews of this cd but in the end i disagree with them this album is not bad and it is nice for what it is however it is your run of the mill native american flute music that sounds like every other cd of its kind if you love this kind of thing and obviously many people do then you will be in seventh heaven with this album but for me i could go to walmart and pick up a cd that sounds just as good from their little sounds of nature display|0
yes a great collection of songs but not great versions  just plain vanilla no heart versions  good price though and a pretty comprehensive disc|0
whilst this is indeed a good selection featuring magnificent music i must take exception to the unusually poor orchestral performance it does not appear to have bothered the other reviewers much but it really needs to be said  though variable across the duration of the album the orchestra is terriblemissed cues and mistakes abound  obviously not sufficiently proficient musicians try and fail to keep up with the music in its more frenetic rhythmic parts silverado appears to fare worse right from the first bar the brass is suffering from appalling intonation even downright tunelessness the whole thing falls to pieces sadly to the extent that by the four minute mark the strings have actually given up on the melody occasionally hitting one right note out of sixteen  this really makes the fillings in my teeth vibratethis is quite simply an amateurish performance  something you expect from your local community symphony orchestra and definitely not what you expect from allegedly professional musicians in the recording studiothat said as i have indicated the music herein presented is indeed fine examples of the genre  but you would be far far better off obtaining the original recordings where available|0
it sounds differentperhaps better than the english mono version but to my ears the 8 songs in stereo from a hard days night on something new sound much betteri also prefer  a hard days night and cant buy me love on beatles1 on these remasters the songs sound polished and cleanin some cases too slickthe bottom end is boosted but i dont think its an improvment the biting clarity of lennons rickenbacker on happy just to dance and tell me why is goneim not sold on these new releasesof course the music is great so it really doesnt matter about these detailsi have bought 6 of these releases but i wont buy any more|0
there are only two carminas which should ever be played ever the 1997 recording with the st louis symphony orchestra under the direction of leonard slatkin or the 2002 recording of the atlanta symphony orchestra and chorus under the direction of donald runncils every recording i have ever heard of this work the chorus or the orchestra or the soloist or the recording its self is just plain awful these two recording are the only two which manage to acceptably balance all the correct elements for carmina|0
ive listened to this album countless times since i purchased it a couple of years ago especially lovely are the renditions of latin pieces one from hildegard another a 13thcentury ave maria yet another the priceless gem ave verum corpus by mozart exciting surprises abound including the wesleyan come o thou traveler depicting a heartfelt search for real relationship with the divine via the story of jacob wrestling with the angel the spirituals deep river and rivers of babylon and the ending peace perfect peace words adapted by von trapp herself clearly elisabeth von trapp loves this music which carries her imprint in the selections the adaptations the musical accompaniment and the production as well as in her beautiful voice|1
this import sounds like a poor bootleg tape even if you enjoy the blues sound of early fleetwood mac this one is pure misery stick with the legitimate labels|0
huge rush fan and this is the best album hands down since roll the bonesit is signals meets 2112 they are rocking out hard again but also throwing in some modern ballads  the qualtiy of the product is first rate and you wont find this for any cheaper and you just walk out your front door and there it isno trip to store|1
i have listened to a lot of performing artists before but the single greatest difference between them and dr hatch is emotion in this cd you can easily tell that dr hatch isnt just technically brilliant like countless other performers but he combines his technical ability to the emotion of each song to create a masterpiece this cd movie masterpieces becomes a cd of masterpieces beccause of this rare talent to play emotionally well and technically well truely a masterful performance|1
if it were possible this remastering improves on the original pink floyds dark side of the moon will always be their masterwork but the wall with its dark and accurate jabs at the establishment runs a close second dont miss it|1
first of all the composition itself petite messe solennelle may not be for everyone  there are some fine moments but i find many of the choral movements to be sprawling and unfocused  the martialsounding tenor aria is a little goofy and operatic for its sacred text but if you really like rossini you might get some guilty pleasure out of it  the soloists are uneven i find the bass and mezzo to be especially disappointing  in general there are some terrifying intonation moments especially during the treacherous a cappella sanctus  wish i could recommend a better recording but this is my first acquaintence with the piece  all things considered i plan on dumping my copy  i havent even listened to the stabat mater which of course is much more widely recorded work|0
how to create the final cut1 start with the wall2 remove all of the actual songs so all that remains is the filler ambiance3 add the magic ingredient of roger waters enormous ego and armies of his cult followers proclaiming that this is something wonderful4 viola  youve now got the final cutthis album is pretentious in the same fashion as a blank canvas called modern arti expected actual great music from pink floyd based on all the positive reviews not an emo poetry readingthis album has more in common with william shatners spokenword efforts than dark side of the moon animals or wish you were here  this is the steepest musical cliff that any band has fallen off that i am aware of  to go from comfortably numb another brick in the wall hey you and run like hell immediately into this steaming pile of trash boggles the mindive purchased hundreds of cds and this is one of the worst music purchases that ive ever made  im still upset about this album decades later  there is more redeeming musical content in modern corporate trash pop than there is in the final paycheck for roger watersdont waste your money on this utter garbage|0
solid playing here and there but overall somewhat clumsily crafted produced and perhaps the absolute worst mixingmastering job from any professional recording in recent memorylets start with the musical review since like most of us i can still appreciate and enjoy excellent songwriting and music even if its recorded badlymusically i can generally sum up the project to one word  monotonous  the formal definition of which is1 lacking in variety tediously unvarying2 characterizing sound continuing on one or few notes3 having very little inflection limited to a narrow pitch rangeindeed we can hear and enjoy some athletic playing and good runs on this record it is rush after all but inventiveness cohesiveness and i hate say it musicianship are sorely and very regrettably lacking here relative to their other stellar achievements  mostly mediocretoweak compositions and production though garden and wreckers are pretty sweet  the craftwork of songwriting seems to be below par here  as if it was overly spontaneous and not thought through carefully enough to create the masterpieces that weve all come to expect from them  and  where are the melodies  i would have hoped that during the 5year lapse between snakes and arrows and this record they would have had an opportunity to thoughtfully wield more craftsmanship and care versus patching together pieces of tired jam sections in hotel rooms and the studio  perhaps it was all composed too hastily but i fear that its worse than that and perhaps geddys and alexs reservoir of habitual fingerboard patterns contained in jam session soundbytes has reached its limit and their formula now needs more professional stretch and disciplinethe worstoftheweak is  wish them well  geddys egregiously repeating and layered vocal choruses have become increasingly annoying over the years but the irksome repeatingechoingreverbing phrase wish them well is unbearable  oh did i mention the repetition  wish them well wish them well wish them well  ugh  geddy has an amazingly talented voice but sometimes with all due respect i wish he would just shut up for a while and let the instrumental sections stand on their own and shine through without feeling compelled to fill each millisecond of musical space with repeating lyrical phrases and overwrought layers of vocal echo repeating phrases and overdubs  whats interesting to me is that with snakes i thought geddys voice had reached an operatic level of sophistication confidence freedom range and quality but those honorable achievements have not been sustained in this record  moreover his vocal intonation is really bad here  singing sharp and flat all over the place  either hes finally losing that range or again perhaps the entire project simply was written and recorded too haphazardly and hastilyadmittedly rush raised the bar quite highly for themselves with snakes and arrows  alas they have missed the mark with this project  i find it very difficult to love anything about this record like i have with all of their others  yes even vapor trails  though i suspect many fellow fans will merely love unconditionally everything this band does which is ok  lets face it  these guys are intelligent kind wellmeaning people and outstanding musicians but simply botched this recordwith respect to the coproducer nick rasculinecz i was very impressed with his work on snakes  i thought he unshackled rush out of their comfortzone at the time freeing them to express a more live improvised jamming feel yet with crafty structure and close attention to melody and harmony  his approach and energy fostered a new trajectory and an environment for the band in which each song was interesting unique and mostly beautiful he also seemed to inspire a renewed freshness vigor and level of enthusiasm with the band  but alas like many of rushs myriad rehashedreused riffs and patterns on clockwork angels perhaps mr rasculinecz also tapped his creative well dry during the snakes project  after blowing his proverbial wad with snakes mr rasculinecz evidently became a nonobjective sycophant  which is the last thing artists should seek from a coproducer  rush needed to move on to be stretched by other creative coproducers and explore new dimensions both personally and musically  they deserved betternow for the audio quality  what can i write that hasnt already been written so eloquently by so many other diehard fans here  it sucks  it just simply sucks  a wall of overly compressed muddy distorted sound  i am not exaggerating when i say that my ears actually hurt after listening to 12 songs has anyone else noticed this  ive tried listening on four different audio systems  my audiophile listening setup at home wadia jeff rowland proac my 2011 bmw system my professional audio recording setup sound devices dacs imac bw headphones and the iphone  all sound horrible  i wonder how the band could have allowed this to be released with such wretched audio|1

truth be told pink floyd shares the pain of a child without the cliche of just words somehow as we listen there is a change in our perception of our own world as we know it somewhere in our subconscience we all know how it feels to really hurt pink floyd is a child in an abusive household whos anguish has no words trauma can never be described in words alone verbage will never do justice to it to know pain is to have felt it firsthand in the title song the wall part 2 the ending phrase being yelled if you dont eat your meat you cant have any pudding how can you have any pudding if you dont eat your meat only scratches the surface of the verbal abuse he deals with the outcry earlier in the song we dont need no education we dont need no thought control only further describes the ultimate frustration that he deals with when he screams hey teacher leave them kids alone the entire album describes an abused child as he developes into a man and grows into the dysfunctional individual that he eventually becomes to read down the track titles of the 2 disc set can only verbally describe the horror that he has endured he has eventually employed every escape tatic that he has in his arsenal to dull the ultimate pain run like hell comfortably numb these songs only lightly vaguely describe the methods of self preservation that pink employs to keep himself sane yet at what expense that i suppose is the question that we all have to ask the child in each one of usdjprimal|1
a typical soundtrackalbum hence that the music is depended on the film only four new beatlestracks with lennons hey bulldog as the classic which would have formed a strong ep this album feels like an unnecessery ripoff|0
its for sure that this is not the best titan available it seems that the studio recording makes it a bit sterile it may be that the engineers thought that they had to do with a quartet recording as for the interpretation mehtas reading is decent but rather uncharacteristic try horenstein bernstein walter or even boulez|0

the best pink floyd album in the postdark side of the moonyears this relentlessly bleak and bitter rock opera is three sides of angst and anger is so meticulously produced that  some 25 years later  it still strikes nerves be it roger waters working through his own personal disintegration the oftrepeated story of his spitting on a fan who kept screaming through acoustic passages to a lifestory of a rockstar with a badoppressive childhood or yet another glance askance at the bands lingering emotional weight about syd barrett the wall looks at the many ways we barricade ourselvestheatrically produced by bob ezrin kissalice cooper it also found the floydians tightening their songs from meandering electronic experiments  think the multipart shine on you crazy diamond fromwish you were here to the point where another brick in the wall pt 2 unwittingly became a hit it also found songs kicking up the tempo to the point were some of these compositions actually rocked run like hell and in the flesh became aor staples despite their segueing into each other but some of the other songs were so perfect that they have become classics or played to death depending on your pov like comfortably numb or hey you also like so many of bob ezrins best work he pulls amazingly theatrical performances particular the vocals waters tortured wail on dont leave me now can give you shiversthe theatricity is also the albums final undoing on the original double lp it was side four that could not hold the walls weight the operatic waiting for the wormsstopthe trial climax flies so overthetop that it becomes the weakest brick its also kind of telling that inpink floyd  the wall movie its almost entirely animated its as if it was so unrealistic as to be incapable of being portrayed by actual humans and as the protagonist rocker pink who seems to be a snide reminder of the which ones pink line onwish you were here slowly drifts into emotional fascism the mentalmusical bombast of this cd overshoots itselfbe that as it may the wall has few equals when it comes to the insistent selfloathing of selfcentered rock and roll stars perhapsthe downward spiralcomes closest perhaps the bleakest thing about the wall is that pink floydwaters sees all this as a viscous cyclethe first words on the album are we came in and the last ones are isnt this where now if that isnt depressing then what is|1
listened to it three times thinking more 35 stars than 4 but 35 to me is a 5 to half the reviewers on amazon i consider 35 stars a damn good album might feel its a firm 4 star after repeated listening|1

this is a real masterpiece everytime you listen to it you encounter new surprises it seems like it evolves with time it never gets old this recording is a must have|1
i was on my way to work at about 445 in the morning and my local rock station happened to play the first song from this album im so sick i couldnt get the song out of my head the rest of the day and was haunted by the vocals just as longa great debut cd i have to admit the ep was a lot better as far as a raw underproduced work can be but the cd is no waste of music especially at the price i got it for 799 newthe vocals are a wonderful mix of dare i say it rush incubus alanis morisette etcthe guitar could use a harder chunkier edge the bass work is lacking the drums are great i think the best thing about this album is the refreshing vocals i havent heard much lately with such an original sound as far as vocals gostay away from there for you dave navarro is a tool|1
let me save you the time and trouble i ordered this record and a hard days night i could not believe these were new records abbey road badly warped finger prints and dust and scratches all over it what a shame  a hard days night was not warped but finger prints scuffed and dirtyi had reservations about ordering a record from a digital master but since they are going back i will never knowi do not like cds much is missing from them do a little homework and see why some people prefer analog and not digital if you are curious also amazon put these reviews with both cds and vinyl like they are the same thing there notthe only good thing i can say about them is they are nice and heavy records like the early beatles and other records were what could have beenauction web site here i comefor the most part i have been happy with amazon this is an exception and customer service has made me happy not easy to do as i expect quality and except nothing less|0
i have several recordings of these works  im always looking for a best performance this isnt it put simply the recording and performance are both thin and ancient sounding despite digital remastering in les preludes there is simply a lack of conviction and the lack of affect is made worse by a recording that makes the orchestra sound understaffed by half a much  vastly  better recording is available on hungaroton hcd 124462 with the hungarian state orchestra conducted by janos ferencsik it also includes the tone poems orpheus and tasso all three tone poems are recorded in fine full sonics with wonderful hall sound and receive committed energetic recordings just about the best ive found over the years if you are serious about the liszt tone poems dont waste your money on this cd|0
not what i expected having had the song played by the two where by the radio announcer mentioned that bill davis was left with few days in this world this one does not compare to the one i listened to  in 1981 played by radio zulu dj in kzn south africa|0

in a classic case of art imitating life john cafferty and the beaver brown band became known by many fm radio listeners as eddie and the cruisers due to their nearperfect performing of the new jerseybruce springsteen sound on a 1983 movie soundtrack of the same nameand while the band found mid1980s success on the cobra and rocky iv movie soundtracks they returned to familiar turf on this 1989 release a sequel to the fictional account of a bar band and the mysterious disappearance of their leader as they were on the cusp of striking gold on the national stagebut the soundtrack formula is in cruise control and fails to stay on track for an entire album when the well runs dry on ideas a concept based on imitation stalls miserably|0
i want to know where all the music that was in the movie  i was very disappointed  not worth the money or effort|0
i have literally not taken this cd out of my car cd player since i first got it a couple of months ago does rush have better songs than the songs on clockwork angels yes several but as an overall effort as a whole composition as single piece of art encompassing all songs on the album i think clockwork angels is their best album ever there are elements that remind me of all of their eras  the 70s 80s 90s and 00s  and i can hear bits of 2112 caress of steel permanent waves power windows counterparts presto and test for echo in the various tracksin addition the story that is told in this concept album really hit home with me and resonates deeply with some of my own life experiences i cannot get enough of this album|1
the best what can i say this album got me through my fathers death deep and perfect pink floyd  is one band that will never grow old buy this if you can and sit back close your eyes and just listen an performance youll never forget listen to it loud and enjoy|1
saw the foot early last november about a month after iii was released the concert was at webster hall in the east village nyc there are no seats so everyone stands from the git go i was ten feet from the stage in the center packed in tight with several hundred new friendsi was expecting hagerfueled good time hard rock with sensei satriani showing all how its done but i hadnt bought iii yet so this was my first time hearing the tunes so i wasnt expecting three and a half letters if you havent already check out the sample for a tastelong story short it brought me right back to my youth in the sixties and the mc5 founders of punk rock and their classic tune up against the wall motherltexpletive deleted three and a half letters is a anthem for todays broken worldright on and rock on chickenfoot|1
transcending time and musical revision pink floyds the wall stands as an epoch work that makes one wonder if this type of musicmessage could be accomplished today this classic epitomized the height of art rock and really changed music and the band for that matter foreverroger waters ode to the slow descent into abhorrent pychosis has a uniqueness and novelty even today that grabs the listener and drags him along for a truly oneofa kind musical experinece pink floyds combination of tight musical discipline and the slightly offkey musings of waters create a rock classic that serves as an alternative to this and any periods music they just dont make music like this anymore songs such as comfortably numb mother young lust vera waiting for the worms and outside the wall speak not only to past generationsthey reach the introspective side of any thoughtful music listener past or presentas with any concept album from the 70s the stones led zeppelin even earth wind and fire and the ohio players this should be listened to in its entirety many times to capture its true artistic genius these songs flow so easily one into another they epitomize the late 70s monster album production techniques this truely is the height of pink floyds career and by virtue of its evident popularity still presents a freshness and immediacy that makes other comtemporary works pale by comparisonsadly this work marked the beginning of the end of this great combination the 1982 issue the final cut was largely a continuation of the separation of roger waters from the group and even though some great music eminated from this breakup rock music never has approached this type of soaring intellectual musicality ever again strong lyrical voice along with exemplary musical backing pink floyd enjoys a place in contemporary music that few others have attained this album epitomizes that standing and should be essential listening for all contemporary and future generations to really understand how to formulate monlithic concept albums highest recommendation|1
ms battle has a wondeful voice and a exquesite tecnique but when she opens her mouth it sounds like she is losing somehitng the feeling of music|0
pink floyd never dissapoint with any of their studio efforts and the wall is no exception as it follows a chronological storyline there are of course some tracks that dont stand up as well on their own but if you listen to the entire album straight through as the floyd would have intended then you cant help but be amazed by the stylistic genius and musical intensity employed on the wall it is however roger waters thoughtful lyrics and intruigingly sinister plot that really make this album worth listening to imo this is the best rock opera since the whos tommy and it impresses on even more flamboyant terms|1
housefire was originally released in 1985 but went fairly unnoticed and quickly went out of print until bullseye records rereleased it onto cd and we can thank then for that  it is a fine showcase for byther smiths talent and while it may not be as solid as some of his other albums it is very fine nonetheless  all but one song is an original a stinging cover of detroit juniors money tree which opens the cd  the rest are all smiitys own and showcase his very intense style  with song titles like the man wants me dead you know he means business  even the instrumental knockdown has a powerful driving force to it that grabs your attention quickly  live on and sing the blues is one of the most powerful slow blues i have heard in a while and you believe smitty that he has lived the blues life when you hear himhousefire may not be as good as the recently rereleased hold that train but it is still a fine album of blues that any fan of byther smiths must have|1
in its entirety the original release of the beach boys christmas album  which contained 12 tracks but ran for just 27 minutes  wasnt and isnt a very longplaying pardon the pun album so to completely remove 3 songs or for that matter any songs and make an even shorter version is just crazy admittedly the 3 songs that were  altogether dropped for this particular release christmas day the man with all the toys and auld lang syne are not exactly among my alltime favorite tracks but i do like them the song little saint nick is here but its the single version rather than the original album versionand not only does this release leave off those songs but it presents the others in a different and bizarre running order with little saint nick a song that should always open any collection containing 60s christmas material by the beach boys positioned somewhat late in the order at track 6also the sound on the cd alternates very strangely between stereo and mono  5 stereo tracks santa claus is comin to town we three kings frosty the snowman blue christmas and ill be home for christmas then a mono track  little saint nick and then another stereo track white christmas followed by two more mono ones santas beard and merry christmas babyseveral other cd versions of christmas album have been put out over the years and while none of those releases are exactly perfect either most of them contain a mixture of stereo and mono mixes of the album tracks though the mixes are not presented as haphazardly as on this cd all of them are better than this pathetic cd  even the 2011 reissue the most recent one which has no bonus tracks as do most of the other reissues and also uses the single version of little saint nick instead of the album versionlike this cd that reissue can be found new for very cheap though not as cheap as this cd  as can the 2004 reissue christmas with the beach boys which has all of the album tracks in stereo not to mention a load of bonus tracks several of which are from the groups shelved attempt at a second christmas album  which by the way had the same title as this cd  from the late 70s the best reissue that has come out so far is 1998s ultimate christmas which is almost the same trackwise as christmas with but has one bonus track more unfortunately however that one now tends to go for a pretty penny new copies anyway|0

negativland is a tapemusic collective who have taken sampling and creative excerpting farther than anyone else  as such they have always lived on the border of legality liberally appropriating huge chunks of the media frenzy swirling around all of us and spitting it back digested arranged and with new meaningin 1991 this got them sued by the litigious island records for parodying the irish selfimportant rock band u2 without their permission  unable financially to fight islands lawyers headon negativland and their thenlabel sst records were forced into an abject surrender pulling it off the market destroying all unsold of all copies of the work and giving up all rights to their own workit turned out to be a pyrrhic victory for island  the negative publicity engendered by the suit cost them dearly while negativland became symbolic of the davids standing up to corporate goliathsnegativland began a long 7year campaign as yet unsuccessful to regain control of their piece which now fetches an absurd 75 on the open marketthis book in true negativland fashion reprints in excruciating detail the lawsuits correspondence print articles public statements and private ruminations during this long ordeal  it makes for a fascinating glimpse into corporate america as well as pointing up the anachronism of copyright laws in the digital agei couldnt put it down|1
this is with out a doubt the greatest rock album of all time  the only piece of music that it can be compaired to is anything by beethoven  with intricate placing of strings guitars vocals and bass work this is the closest thing that rock has to a symphony  it is a masterwork that any decent person would kill to write  all works of the beatles the rolling stones even led zeppelin do not even come close to the beauty of this album  this album has changed many lives and caused many musicians to devote their lives to trying to make a work like this  all should hear this and let the music and the message of not to build wall enter their minds and free them of the crap the world has ordered them to believe  bravo pink floyd and thank you|1
an obscure but essential release featuring two early demo tracks 20th century boy and love in a voidthe lords prayer the banshees demos have never appeared on an official release the legitimacy of this one seems slightly dubious but lets ignore thatsound quality isnt perfect with some very audible defects but its still great to hear this stuff siouxsie has a screechy little teenage voice and the band still have their thrashingmenacing sound which had already been softened by the time they were properly recorded you also get to hear the notorious original lyrics of love in a voidthe book isnt anything special some inaccuracies and more of the authors personal opinions than youll care to read the discography is copied and pasted from an old website typing errors and all its worth buying just for the cd a gem in the small number of siouxsie releases over the last few years|1
i think i was born in the wrong era this is a great cd and so much fun to listen to i also bought several cds from the ultra lounge series another great purchase thanks amazon for grouping similar items together or i never would have found this cd|1
this is the worst beatles album and it is really the only example of the band not giving their fans their moneys worth half of this album consists of cottoncandy orchestrations by george martin and no serious music fan can call it good material with any conscience whatsoverthe originals here are few and of mixed quality the skinny is that if you are a beatles completist as i am you will want to own this album for hey bulldog all together now and its all too much otherwise save your money|0
i have to admit it  i didnt care for it much at all  and i am a pretty big rush geek  but i kept listening and found that it has grown on me  i still think geddys singing is a bit stretched at times and i would have enjoyed more solos from alex  but overall its a very very solid concept album and i am very glad they went this route on this album  great story great music and a nice change of pacegreat work guys|1
a momentary lapse of reason is exactly what this work is  the departure of pink floyd from pink floyd is something truly sad  when i listen to songs like julia dream or a pillow of winds or even alans psychedelic breakfast and then i listen to this monstrosity  it makes me want to cry  the final cut should have been since then its been a downward spiral  they gave up on art and opted for being rock icons a damnable pity if there ever was one|0
first the music is fantastic this is not about the music but i am greatly disappointed in the quality of the sound with all the rave reviews i thought they had really captured something great in this remasteri am a baby boomer and grew up in the magical era of the beatles i have decided to try to find the best versions of the beatles collection preferably in digital format the effort is really about finding superior versions to the thin sounding parlophone cds from the 80s it wasnt their fault they didnt understand the depths of converting analog tapes to digitalso ive tried to learn audiophileese which involves things like spectral analysis dynamic range frequency analysis eq limiting loudness wars and on and on ive tried converting my own original lps to digital tried the capitol cds tried the ebbetts and mirror spock bootlegs tried various pre2009 remasters found that remaster really means our latest interpretation of the original and finally the 2009 remastersafter reading millions of opinions on the sound of the various versions the test method came down to how the hl does it sound in my car then on my moderately priced headphones and then on my moderately priced audio system in my living room plus my friend who claims to be an audio expert helped me run a test on all of these versions on his more expensive audio system i listened and listened and ranked and ranked fully recognizing that beauty is in the eye of the beholder here is what i foundthis 2009 remaster of abbey road is significantly better than the 80s parlophone version and since its easy to buy and relatively cheap buy it if you arent that picky however in the case of abbey road my 1983 toshiba black triangle which is expensive now blows away this 2009 remaster surprisingly so did the digital conversion of one of my original lps i have a relatively unplayed lp  bought duplicates for recording onto reeltoreel back then who knows maybe the 2009 versions do sound better than any other versions on multimillion dollar audio systems but not on mine or my friendsmy friend also has the entire 2009 box sets in stereo and mono we put those to work and in general they sound muffled like this 2009 abbey road remaster as compared to my originals the capitol cds the ebbets bootleg and the mirror spock bootleg in fact for prerevolver i think the capitol cds are by far the best some of the 2009s sound as good as the other options and i chose the 2009 stereo versions of revolver sgt pepper and most of the white album to use thats it from the 2009 setswhy is it that the toshiba black triangle digital version of abbey road and the capitol digital albums are so much better than these 2009 remasters assuming i have a relatively good ear is it just the remastering preference of the 2009 remaster engineers or could these 40year old master tapes be wearing out and this is the best they can do my old reeltoreel tapes sound pretty muffled after all these years i know their tapes are maintained a little better yes i also know about the dexterizing of some of the capitol songs but guess what thats what we learned the beatles were in americaim starting to think that the closer you get to the 1960s release versions the more pristine the sound will be my gut tells me that if they were to take original mint vinyl and remaster those professionally much like what ebbetts and mirror spock have done rather than the original master tapes they would get a better sound and one that is closer to the original soundtoo bad this wonderful review will be lost in a few weeks because its the first group of reviews that get the high numbers|0
i think the remix shouldnt have been done because bush does not have the type music to be written in a remix form  it gets really aggitating because it repeats the same line over and over again|0
im not a pink floyd fan but the one album which belongs in every single persons music collection no matter what that persons taste is is definitely the wallit is like one long song one story beautifully  and very artistically compiled via a number of shorter masterpieces in  themselvesdescribing the wall in words is a task nobody can fulfill  so just buy it it belongs in your collection believe me cause this is  the masterpiece of music art the best album ever released ever and im  not a pink floyd fan|1

i was very let down by this recording i enjoy glenn goulds playing immensely for other composers but he just doesnt seem to really understand these pieces sometimes he gets a phrase or two but only on the  surface it sounds like he just pours syrup all over the music without  really digging any deeper he actually brags about how quickly he learned  some of the pieces before recording them only hours before rolling the  tape music like this requires much more patience and thought to really  understand its depth and beauty i found many of his gestures to be very  superficial and thus distracting and irritatinglisten to peter rosel  an artist who really gets it|0
being a rush fan i always looked forward to their releases until this one  i heard the single caravan and it just never really grew on me  this led to me placing a purchase of the album on the back burner  about a year after release i finally picked up a copy for myself and gave it a listenit would take a lot for the band to top their previous release snakes and arrows and i was pleasantly surprised to find that the band was more than up to the challengeclockwork angels is an album that has managed to become my favorite rush album  not 2112 not a farewell to kings though both still rank extremely high for me clockwork angels  this is an album that finds a band that at one time many considered finished that is managing to hit new creative highs not heard since moving picturesthe album runs from hard rock to beautiful balladry to catchy pop rock as pop as rush gets i suppose  the album also feels like a welcome back party for alex lifeson who gets to really come to the forefront after a couple of albums playing an essential support role  geddy sounds like hes having a blast with the lyrics and lays down some of the sweetest bass lines of his career and neil well neil continues to be amazing behind the kiti highly recommend this album to fans of progera rush and of concept albums  this is a band that has tapped an inspirational well and pumped every bit into every note they play on this record  not every song is amazing but there arent any skip worthy tunes  besides how often do you hear about a 45 year old band putting out an album that easily ranks with their classics|1
this is probably the best album of the beatles  ive had this album in vinyl  unfortunately the cd reproduction has lost the beauty of the sound of this album  i use audiophile grade stereo system and to no avail  ive also tried it in my discman and my other mini components but still the poor sound  other beatles albums have been reproduced better in cd  its a pity the record company does not plan to remaster it to make it sound better|0

i like the work that gilmour has made really i hope you like too but to use the pink floyds name in a albun like that the new machine part i and ii its a prove that gilmour rumour and egoim theres nothing to suggest the pink floyd sound|0
coming from a life pink floyd fan i can say that this is not the finest pf album it is better that 95 of music out but compared to other pf albums it is ok this album first off is almost watters solo work exept for comfortably numb and run like hell that dave gilmore contributed on another brick in the wall part 2 is the most overplayed pf song and gives listiners the wrong perspective on pf if you want the real pf look at meddle darkside animals and wish you were here and even alot of there really old stuff the wall is great and has many strong moments but its not as good as you might think|1
brian regan is a comic genius  he takes the simple episodes of his life and retells them in hilarious fashion  you cannot listen to this cd and not laugh uncontrollably  i chuckle to myself everytime i think of one of his routines  take luck|1
ah december 1979  inflation is high recession is coming the hopes of iranian liberty are being slowly but quite surely throttled by a nasty theocracy suharto and botha can look to another decade of blooddrenched power the soviets are invading afghanistan the americans are thereby giving yet another bloodthirsty pakistani junta an undeserved lease on life the italian christian democratic party has wiggled out of a well deserved nemesis thatcher has taken power reagan is rising archbishop romero has only a few months to live american cinema is on the brink of financial disaster followed by artistic collapse and most pop music sucks  i mean really i love the nightlife  so its time to get back to the basics and here is the wall to do itthe obvious objection to the wall is what has roger waters got to complain about  pink floyd has already produced at least three wellreceived albums that decade one of them one of the most insanely successful in history  that eastern europeans should confuse the title of this with the berlin wall certainly shows a lack of proportion does it not  why should we care about the selfpity and solipsism of a wealthy rockstar  well first because it is not all his fault  waterspink is an orphan  dying at anzio is no doubt better more productive than dying on the somme but it doesnt make being orphaned any happier  british education can be horribly lifedenying and petty  there is good reason for waters to be terrified at the prospect of nuclear war in goodbye blue skies  after all the cold war was an enormous gamble and as iraq shows not all realist or neoconservative gambles work  secondly its not as if perfect maturity and mental health was or is the default setting of our modern world  if peoples marriages fall apart if their families are claustrophobic if they are full of impotent and not so impotent rage and hatred its not as if we could simply pride ourselves on our superior morality and ignore them  lovelessness and solipism are not simply waters faultthird the musics great  waters and gilmours voices are perfect for the roles they play the one selfpitying guilty spiteful and angry the other blandly horrible in an especially british way  there is a certain evil reality in such lyrics as cold as a razor blade tight as a tournequetdry as a funeral drum as they describe despair better than anything else  there are the opening bars with a certain false lightness of nobody home  there is a real insight in the  desperation and authentic misogyny of dont leave me now  bring the boys back home is brief but heartbreaking  there is the heartbreaking comfortably numb as beautiful childhood experience is purged from the memory and there is the threat of fascism in run like hell  there are the ominious perfect undertones of another brick in the wall part one but there are few seconds as powerful as the last bars of the happiest days of our lives where the crescendo of imperial glory crashes into the nightmare of britian in 1979  there should have been another way but since there wasnt the wall is the best way to end the seventies|1
they are back and this is yet again another fantastic album by one of the greatest bands ever and this is worth your money so if you love rush then dont hesitate and just go ahead and buy it trust me you will not regret it|1
but one would rather watch the milk commerical at least it markets some real stuff and doesnt take 70 labored minutes the coalition of the willing was undoubtedly doing a heck of a job in holding its base against various village bands vying for the authority on the same music with a different ode and the commanderinchief barely held its members together despite all the freiheit it is a freudlos performance|0
the cello concerto by yoyoma and eugene ormandy is adequately played i would recommend getting an interpretation by rostropovich howeverthe real letdown is the fifth symphony a normally electrifying work that is played so ponderously by bernstein that the listener quickly loses interest try the versions by mravinsky or pretty much any other version for that matter it is hard to imagine this symphony played worse than in this recording|0
brian regan is hilarious  period  if you are looking for a comedian who finds humor in the everyday stuff that happens to us all  he is your man  he does not swear and does not talk about inappropriate matter  he is just a reallife guy that can make you laugh so hard that you make the ugly face  he makes you hope for a pause so you can gain your hearing back and catch a breath  seriously funniest comedian  an added bonus is the mannerisms and body language he exudes while bringing his comedy to you|1
as we used to say back in the day this album is killer  myles kennedy and slash are a perfect fit  although i love what ive heard from alter bridge over the years i hope that myles and slash keep this thing going  dont f around  buy the cd and support real rock n roll|1
i have listened to jean redpath many times on prairie home companion and always enjoyed her performance  while surfing the bbc site i came across a best scottish poems contest  in researching the poems i found jean redpath had recorded a song version of several  ms redpaths clear tones and fluid delivery made it a delight to listen to all the songs on this album most of which i never heard before  i particularly enjoyed the broom o the cowdenknowes it is a rather different style then silly wizards version which i also enjoy|1
dear lord please make it stop i like world music but not this the pieces are way too long and each musician seems to be playing a different song i have had this disc for for over ten years and have not been able to sit though it|0
i heard this album in its entirety for the first time at my brothers fourth of july party this year  this album is another turn in a different direction for rush  this band keeps evolving musically seemingly with each album they put out and clockwork angels is no exception  even in their late fifties and early sixties geddy lee alex lifeson and neil peart keep on evolving and most important of all keep on rockingso far this is a 4star album but i say so far because it seems that so many rush albums grow on me over time  eventually i end up raising my rating of the album  well see if it happens again with clockwork angelsi definitely plan to purchase this album soon as i have all the rush albums and want to add this to my collection|1
as i played this the first time i was thrilled to find that each cut was as good or better than the one before besides the title cut  the single youre a lie i esp liked no more heroes  anastasia slash sounds better than ever and technically hes raised the bar for his fellow rock gods by laying down everything from flamenco to metal its no wonder that throughout his career everyone from iggy pop and micheal jackson to alice cooper and more recently rihanna have asked him to play on their recordsmyles kennedy is the perfect lyrical muselead vocalist for slash and his unbelievably wellhoned chops he proved himself worthy by being the only artist to sing on two tracks on slashs debut solo album starlignt and back from cali and then touring with slash for that album and not only nailing songs from it by ian astbury chris cornell and andrew stockdale no small feat but also material from velvet revolver slashs snakepit and of course some of guns n rosess greatest hits check out the double live discfeaturing myles kennedy live made in stoke 24711if you missed the tourfinally after twentyfiveplus years a handful of bandsprojects a serious health scare 2001 heart failure a couple of wives and kids epic drug addiction and 6 years of sobriety slash finally has the kick you in the face rock band he deserves seriously in my opinion slash and his wicked guitars plus myles kennedy on vocals todd kerns on bass and brent fitz on drums otherwise known as myles kennedy and the conspirators equal one helluva great rock and roll banddont get me wrong i loved that other band and back from when they were playing the bars on sunset blvd mind you but once the venues and some of the bands egos got too big the dynamics changed and they were never the same hopefully people will not feel the need to mention he who shall not be named in every review of this record cause make no mistake this is a solid rock record from a solid rock bandthankfully slash has continued to grow musically and his big fat swirling guitar riffs have never sounded better hey even if his head swells a little no worries cause theres gotta be plenty of room left inside that big old hat|1
material 5 stars one of these days capitol will pay for their treatment of the beatles catalog dont get me wrong 6266 and 6770 were the first beatles records tapes actually i ever heard and went from there to buy  every beatles workluckily the parlophone reissues of 87 had just become  available so i got those what a mess capitol made of those albums in the  60s quite a tragedy now here we are nearly 40 years later and the only  hits packages availible to new beatles listeners fail to include long tall  sally she said she said rain tomorrow never knows the inner light dear  prudence i know its sort of nostalgic to have the original red and blue  recordsbut i think apple and capitolemi need to reevaluate some things  two collections featuring these and other milestones of pop wouldve really  added a nice touch but alas im not in some stupid office high above  hollywood and vine  i have an old vinyl copy of revolverand you know  what it sounds better than my cd|0
i purchased this cd because i had a recording of prayers of kierkegaard in high school in the 1970s and liked it very much  this robert shaw recording is very disappointing  i believe it is because there is excessive romance in the tempo which never holds steady with every turn there is a new pace which then splashes into the next establishing no driving classical adherence to the integrity of the whole piece  its been degraded into an irritating chain of disjointed sound bites each begging for emotional appeal when a lack of cohesion has failed to bring the listener anywhere  i have other great recordings under direction of robert shaw and think this performance is not typical  i want to say the rendition is downright horrible  but maybe my tastes have changed over years and i no longer enjoy the piece maybe its too neoromantic for me as an early 20th century composition  the recording i remember enjoying has not been in my possession for almost 30 years and i do not know whos performance it was  if anyone could reduce this piece to its essentials it would be neville marriner but ive not looked into whether he has recorded prayers of kierkegaarddoesnt seem like his type of work to do|0
i love brian regan  i have two of his dvds saw his show once when he was in town and now have this cd for the car  every time he brings me to tears of laughter  he is one of the funniest and cleanest comedians i know of and i cant wait to see his show again live|1
i recently starting doing tai chi which i love immensily adding this cd to my practice enhanced my ability to stay focused on this beautiful art form i usually listen to the music just before i begin my session this way it helps to relax me and put me into that comfort zone the peace and tranquillity that surrounds me during my exercise session is more than what i could have imaginedanyone practicing tai chi or yoga i would strongly recommend this cd that ancient melodic and peaceful sound added to your session is something youll never forget im sure you will not be disappointed|1
i looked forward to fresh recordings of the fantastic moszkowski concerto and the wonderful paderewski concerto  piers lane is an excellent pianist whose recording of the scriabin preludes is highly highly recommended  it is a gem of a recording  i cant really say that for his recording of these concertos  in and of themselves they are fine performances but once you have heard michael pontis moszkowski on vox and earl wilds paderewski on elan there is no comparison whatsoever  in light of ponti and wild lane lacks luster vitality and the powerful moving delivery of the ponti and wild recordings  the orchestra in the lane recording is likewise less than satisfactory  get ponti and wild|0
longtime rush fan here 30 years beginning with the first album and continuing on  regrettably i have to say this release is god awful  it just goes from bad to worse  for the life of me i cannot understand all of these high reviews  for me i find the songwriting to be extremely poor not a memorable tune here  the guitar work is unimaginative and very average  i didnt dig geddys singing either  he seems unable to write and deliver a good hook or melody  the quality of the recording stinks too  by todays standards and those of yesteryear this release is a complete an utter losersorry guys but this is the worst cd i have heard in years  i want my money back|0
through bad luck i won this cd at my offices christmas white elephant gift exchange last year i laughed and proceeded to put the cd on shrieks of horror ensued shortly thereafterthis might might be funny or cute for about oh 10 seconds but 20 songs for over 40 minutes is something else  pure torture  if this cd were played at gitmo it would be tortureyou can even like cats and absolutely hate this screeching racketbuy it for a joke or buy it to torture someone but please please please dont buy it as a real gift for someone not if you love them|0
bought this based on just one song all around me very pleased with the whole cd reminds me of evanescence in a way|1
this is what happens when a band has no success for whatever reason but because they picked the name of an already established band their small legacy gets mixed up with the earlier bands catalog of releases it looks like someone anyone from the record company would have hipped them to the fact that another band had a career using the same nameplus one letter z  amazing that it was allowed to happen i guess to be fair amazoncom deserves some of the blame for their lack of quality control oh by the way i never heard of this band nor their music they may be good however oh heck  ill try and give them a little boostbuy it|0
and in fact theyre from some other early 20th century new orleanian universe one that doesnt contain bobby hutcherson sadly and furthermore not a single vibraphone note can be heard on any of these cuts let alone a marimbathis is of course a review of the samples and not of this album by one of the unheralded giants of jazz music to which sadly i wont be exposedim only doing this to raise amazons attention through this method as ive already tried other methods all to no avail|0
heres a new one for your enjoyment this album is a poor mans bill evans thats right mark i do like white pianists bill evans perhaps the greatest jazz pianist ever and his trios recording put this stale attempt to shame thats fact not opinion whereas brubeck plays some daring solos he comes nowhere near the harmonic invention of evans is my journalism offending you yet as a musician for all but two years of my life i find it funny to question my abilities to play in 54 time may as well be 34 time since its just as easy to read and play i seriously think youre an old man since you have no clue how boring the drum solo is indeed a flacid attempt at any sort of polyrhythmic invention i suggest some elvin jones lastly to deny that this won fame because it was headed by a white musician is totally ignoring the racism that pervaded the music industry during this time that is not to say that it cannot be admired on its own merits so spare me nay us all your lack of ethnocentrism as im sure youd be quick to label it i wont even make the obvious comparison between dave brubeck and eminem and their sales figures ill leave it up to you to make up your mind after all im just informing which is what journalism doeslater gator|0
i bought this cd because the cover art was so pretty it shows a castle superimposed over a holiday ornament and the cd has the same design on it when i played it i quickly realized that this is not celtic musicits very slow drearysounding synthesised instrumentals useful for putting yourself and all pets in the vicinity into a light fog all four of my parakeets went to sleep and my pomeranian passed out beware do not listen to while operating a motor vehicle or heavy machinery|0
this album blows in stereo sorry it does those of you who dont think so purchase the mono box those are the proper mixes and takes the first two albums are so much better in mono what a difference i cant even listen to this in stereo with the left right vocal problem i have both stereo and mono box sets also what a differnce in please please me and with the beatles|0
this was sent out fast in good shape have on cd but had to get this for my turntable sounds great|1
i have been collecting various recordings of gregorian chant and picked this one up based on the selections price and reviews on amazon but i was shocked and appalled when i first played the disc the great glory of gregorian chant is that it is to be sung unaccompanied  yet on most of the cuts on this disc 10 out of 17 an organ is heard nonetoodiscretely intoning the opening sequence of notes and then underscores the entire chant it was very disconcerting hearing this but there are other problems too the singing itself is some of the ugliest i have heard on chant recordings  nasal and throaty and in addition on some tracks you can hear what sounds like doors slamming shut things dropping on the ground all manner of intruding noises i have tried my best to overlook what i can only call defects in this particular recording but ive finally decided i cant and will be unloading this disc pronto|0
do you really need to read a review about a new rush album at this point youre silly go ahead and buy it|1
like always petra is petra the great rock sound of this album is awsome i do recommend this to anyone|1
i really love pink floyd  each of their albums offer a very different selection of songs  however this one is quite bland  the songs all melt together so i cant even say which are good and which are bad  it is obvious that after waters left the band did have to reinvent itself just as it did after syd barrett left after piper at the gates of dawn  this album is easy to overlook and i dont suggest getting it unless you want to complete your collection|0
this is most likely the worst of the passport albums  the compositions are weak and boring  the playing is lifeless  on top of that it does not have the great rich sound of previous passport cdsthe sound quality of this cd is fairly good but it is average  one of the great things about previous passport cds was the gorgeous sound  it resonated  the editing and mix was always very good  it could take weak music and make it very enjoyable  balance of happiness does not have that trademark soundin the early days klaus doldinger leader of passport was fairly energetic and innovative composer  first he played a more traditional jazz and then moved on to fusion  when he made his move to sunday brunch type of jazz of the eighties he became boring  his compositions were repetitious and the playing was lifeless  if you like the sunday brunch type of music then it would be better sticking with spyro gyra later weather report or even kenny g gaspif you think you will like this cd you might want to act fast  passport cds come and go and can be hard to find|0
great christmas album also highly recommend his instrumental album freedom its one of my alltime favorite recordings|1
its a horror sequel so im being nice with the twostar rating horror sequels are rarely ever good and this is no exception i honestly forget most of the plot but i think it had something to do with pinhead trying to get out of a concrete block and enlisting the help of a teenager the gore is useless and vague the dialogue makes little to no sense and the special effects leave much to be desired the series only got worse with bloodline but the fifth is a real treat as ive said hundreds of times before hellraiser 3 just falls flat on the screen dying in an embarrased blunder in front of the viewer somewhere clive barker is angry|0
simply  one of the best rock albums put out by anyone in some time would love to see this album live from start to finish|1
ah memories of 1988 great album by petra from rocking songs like all fired up hit you where you live defector to the awesome ballad the homeless few an amazing album|1
brainwave symphony  even though the sleep cd was playing very very soft i found the changing dynamic levels would wake us  i am wondering if anyone else found this to be a problem  i have several of the thompson cds and believed them to be very interesting|0
this is one of his earlier performances but funny none the less hes more observational humor and family friendly i recommend|1
as a roger waters album i would give this two stars as a pink floyd album it gets a one star rating at best it isnt really until the last three songs that it even feels vaguely like pink floyd and thats the wall era floyd at that or that theres much musicality at all in rogers poetic lament there was a time that i enjoyed this album when i appreciated everything floyd in the 80s but in retrospect i think its an outrage that this was released under the name pink floyd and gilmour and mason need to be blamed as well for allowing waters to take so much control at least they remedied the situation with two fine floyd releases sans waters and a great gilmour solo release in 1984|0
the musical performance is fine but the recording is of poor quality particularly in softer passages  im not sure what bit rate was utilized when converting this file to mp3|0
this cd is fantastic the music the concept all great i dont know how they do it cant wait to see this tour|1
i picked this up used jeff beck may be playing on it but it is definitely not the jeff beck group the vague liner notes say jeff beck band i think its someones demo of their songs no good buy any other jeff beck album 0 stars|0
karajan and the vienna philharmonic are wonderful domingo is wonderful hendricks is wonderful but there is one big flaw that ruins this recording of turandot katia ricciarelli is totally miscast as turandot she has a beautiful lyric voice but it is not large enough to portray the enigmatic princess i would recommend the cds of nilssoncorelli martoncarreras or sutherlandpavarotti i would also recommend the dvd of martondomingo|0
it is clear that bill hicks had many loyal adoring fans indeed i was convinced to buy this album by one of them that bill hicks was energetic dark and angry is undeniable that dying of pancreatic cancer he had ample reason for his cynicism and anger is equally undeniable what i find eminently deniable is that he was a comic genius his subjects such as rush limbaugh jesse helms and religious hypocrites are easy and obvious so far as i can see his humor consists virtually entirely of rants and profanity against these admittedly eminently deserving targets however i found little originality in his work no nuance no exploration of previously unexplored angles he did get off a few zingers and he clearly has a graphic imagination and since the album is advertised as a rant i guess it would be churlish to complain about false advertising but others have gone off on similar subjects with far more acuity eddie izzard and george carlin come immediately to mind i dont wish to start an argument with hicks fans but i think it is worth noting that at least not everybody finds humor in profanitylaced tirades against easy targets that some of his fans have found hicks humor lifechanging is absolutely mindboggling to me i can only assume they have lived rather sheltered lives for hicks viewpoint to come across as revelatory|0
if youre looking for the classic riffs and unsettling lyrics that made black sabbath into the band most easily assoicated with the term heavy metal choose another record headless cross is far from sabbaths best its a very dull popmetalsounding album that made me run screaming back to black sabbath volume 4the musicians on the album  tony iommi cozy powell tony martin et al are of course great however the songwriting consists of clunky boring riffs coupled with lyrics that are made up of silly horror movie clichesif you want a good sabbath album from the tony martin era grab eternal idol headless cross will leave you feeling a little more broke and a lot more annoyed|0
i had raffi for my boys while growing up and recently my oldest son had his first child so i thought it was only appropraite to buy raffi easy fun little songs for younger children to sing along with|1
where can i start but to say i could not wait to get clockwork angels i knew rush would blow me away with the pure quality and innovation and some of the coolest riffs from the past i just hope they never stop i want to thank them because their music has always been an inspiration|1
its hard to find appropriate music for doing tai chi this series of four songs is perfect also good music just for relaxing to|1
no snively heartwarming feely touchy ballads no cursing just good old fashioned rock the way it should be these guys need to release a live recording|1
buy this cd for tracks 11 12 and 13  the finale of the score is amazing with a powerful buildup of the choir and orchestra  the rest of the score sadly is a waste of time  track 1 rips off the main title to  james horners brainstorm before settling into a repetitive percussion  motif  tracks 3 and 7 are merely recycled from silvestris predator score  everything else is simply synth droning and boring atmosphere  music  if it werent for the last ten minutes of the score i would sell  this disc|0
this collection is realy bad the sound quality is the worst aspect all of it has an air back noise try to record anything with your old microtaped answermachine it will be the same as these effects there are certanly other collections better then this one that is old fashioned and it doesnt have 400 diferent sounds at least 150 are repetitions with the same title without mention those with a diferent title and the same effect save your money and look for something new|0
oakenfold may be the worlds number 1 dj because of the amount of money he makes but that doesnt make him any goodhis cds are bad and his live sets are even worse ive seen him like and he disappoints not only is his mixing sub standard live he can hardly beatmatchi would recommend danny tenaglia for those who truly appreciate good music|0
there is little that i can add to the many voices who have praised this great work but i feel compelled to do so largely the work of composerlyrical genius roger waters the sheer scope of the wall is breathtaking in its ability to move and shock you an effect that has not diminished as it now enters its 27th year mixing semibiographical material with knowing fiction waters weaves a tale that is equal parts grim satire nearoperatic melodrama and gutwrenching anger waters attacks the capitalist cynicism of the music business the oftimes cookiecutter puttingdown of schoolkids and most significantly the complexity and pitfalls of familial and married life and of course the bitter futility of war which is as relevant now as it was in 1944 or 1979 the wall has been and always will be a soundtrack for the angry and the disaffected but dont get me wrong there are moments of musical beauty that will stay with you long after the anger has faded waters voice flexes its considerable emotional range across a variety of moods guitarist david gilmours melodic lead playing sizzles with passion and power his intensity and soaring tone makes the wall arguably his finest recorded performance and his vocal contributions to the album also cannot be overlooked keyboardist rick wright and drummer nick mason make important musical contributions and wiz producer bob ezrin ties it all together into a soundscape that is timeless the wall will take you on a journey through light and darkness and you will emerge outside the wall like roger waters better for the experience one of rocks true masterpieces and certainly not the least of them|1
this is edited from the original album half the tags and jokes are missing why would you delete the best parts|0
yeah ive heard all the complaining about 8090s sabbath before  and you all are reading about it in many of these reviews  sure tony iommi probably should have tried on a new band name for size somewhere around 82 when dio left  but lets all forget about slagging the name sabbath without ozzy of course and just focus on the albums content  nothing on headless cross is particularly inspiring although the opener gates of hell is a gloomy instrumental which brings to mind e5150 from mob rules  then onto the title track which is fairly forceful with a trademark cozy powell beat driving the song  devil and daughter is probably my favorite tony martinera tune and it would be cool to here an updated version with better production  and yes when death calls does rock around another menacing riff  but side two is mostly dreck and i really cant take kill in the spirit world or black moon very well at all  these songs are too straightforward and offer little in the way of distinction from one another  ok it looks like im jumping on the diss iommi bandwagon but you cant blame the man for wanting to continue to play  hes still a great guitarist in need of some or quite a bit of inspiration|0
this is probably the worst recording i have heard of this piece the tempos are too slow the ensemble is unbalanced and the recording quality particularly in the sixth movement is mediocre in general it sounds as if  the group never rehearsed together the clarinettist is particularly inept  listen to the slow section of the sixth movement when either bad recording  technique or a lack of finesse in the ensemble results in the clarinet  suddenly jutting out of the homophonic texture  in the opening movement  the rhythm is far too flexible to maintain any cohesion between the  players other movements similarly suffer from a lack of consistent tempo  and rhythm again the sixth movement contains distortions of the rhythms  that to my ear destroy much of the charm the tashi recording also  suffers from several misinterpretations of the music it is generally too  fast though ill admit their ensemble playing is amazing how much time  did they spend editing and reediting  i do however love the last  movement violin solo i recommend the erato recording another  messiaenwasthere venture|0
i havent heard a sound of this theme song whats up your web site is for the birds|0
the sebo ensemble first became known in the 1970s in hungary where they inspired the revival of the tanchaz dancehouse movement showing that hungarian folk music can be exciting and beautiful in modern times as well they play on traditional and almost forgotten instruments such as the hurdygurdy the jewsharp the the lyre and the zither some of which were last popular in the middle ages the first half of the album is made up of folk songs  some are quite lively and danceable the second half is music composed by the band and set to poems but is equally good material whether youre a fan of eastern european or world music or youre just looking for something to bob your head to this is a great album|1

myles kennedy talent without axl attitude  the band looks happy when you see them together slash gets bet turf w age |1
the star quality of the performers lead me to believe this would be a good purchase  however it took less than 2 minutes for me to realize i had too much confidence in von karajan  co  the balance between the orchestra and chorus is not good and when you can hear the chorus it sounds as if theyre standing in the middle of a gymnasium  i did try to give it a chance and listen all the way through but after sampling several tracks and being in pain each time i had to stop  i dont doubt the other reviewers who enjoyed this recording i simply have different expectations for a performance of this piece  i have heard several and though the purists may chuckle at my recommended conductor i recommend deutsche grammophon  leonard bernstein with symphonieorchester des bayerischen rundfunks  just my 2 cents|0
great music  however not happy about not being able to load the first disk onto my computer  sent the first one back and had the same problem with the replacement  disk 2 loads fine  now i cant put the first disk on my mp3 player|0
clockwork angels is a great album and essential for all rush fans snakes  arrows was a solid release but it had a couple songs that were just average clockwork angels offers everything they did in the past from classics like 2112 hemispheres moving pictures and modern rush from all the way up to snakes  arrows headlong flight sounds like it came from caress of steel which they havent followed the rawer heavier progressive metal direction until now however it doesnt have any of the electronicera rush or synthesizer which ive never been a huge fan of it has a good variety and diversity but it sounds most like the traditional rush late 70s and early 80s progressive rock clockwork angels has a quality and clean production good songwriting and is a consistent album through out it starts of great and gets better towards the end they havent disbanded and are still making quality music after being around for over 38 years and arent going to quit anytime soon the 21st century has been a great era for rush and clockwork angels is perfect for the new decade one of the best albums to come out in the 10s yet|1
a unique kind of sound which  can be addictiveyou will grow to love this group and morphine as wellmark sandman  is incrediblegod rest his soul|1
to my surprise nothing really stood out as i expected it to this album didnt do it for me 35 years ago either i was hoping i was wrong perhaps im just tired like they were then|0
this is the worst of all pink floyds albums  if like me you are a fan of classic floyd you are going to find this mess of a album a big disappointment big on synthesizers and small on ideas it sounds like the soundtrack of a secondrate american cop show  contains the ridiculous track learning to fly unfortunately this is the high point of the whole album it nose dives into the ocean after this|0
this album is nothing special giro was just another salsa romantica singer trying to compete and make a name for himself in an already overcrowded field by the time this cd was issued in 1994 frankie ruiz paquito guzman cheo feliciano rey ruiz and gilberto santa rosa all made far better and more enjoyable salsa romantica albums|0
if you happen to run across a nww fan chances are they will either a speak of the greatness of chance meeting with the glowing eyes of an acned geek on the verge of getting the latest game console or b rabidly inquire as to where they can acquire this lost treasure  truth be told however its a pretty crap albumobviously nww is a loveitorloatheit project anyway but even for someone like myself a nww fan this is a rather embarrassing glimpse into what i would even call the formative years of nww this simply sounds like and actually is three guys yes nww was once more than just steve stapleton who cant play their instruments playing their instruments  nowhere are the tape mutations that have made nww such a unique and awesome force they just sound like they want to recreate the first faust albumwhich was a classic if there ever was oneand fail miserablyi only give it two stars because the six buttons of sex appeal has its endearing moments|0
everything about this cd is great the music  the lyrics and most of all laceys voice not often can someone with such a powerful voice be found in hard rock the combination is nothing short of spectacular|1
rachmaninov has some works of astounding beautyim thinking of a number of his piano preludes and his 2 elegaic trios  this opera is not one of his masterpiecesits an early opera interesting gypsy love story but rather mundane musically  the final 2 scenes show some glimpses of brilliance  overall ild rate this a dont buy|0
should be 5 stars  cant seem to edit the stars  i was first exposed to this recording in a high school spanish class  i was blown away  through some difficulty i eventually came to own the lp  my comprehension of the lyrics has faded but my appreciation for the music has not  serious ear candy  its amazing stuff to these very american ears  some of it has a get under skin quality that is especially pleasing  i recommend this cd to everyone even if you dont know a lick of spanish|0
i love this album because it takes me to my most earliest childhood me being born in 1983 and this first album of his coming out the same year there are some real classics in this album including friends and you really  need a saviourmy personal favorite a strong recommendation if you are  interested in the music of michael w smith|1
the wall is the greatest fulllength concept album of all time period  the recording is immense somewhat unaccessable dark and completely brilliant  nine inch nails and tool come to mind when reviewing this album because these two bands and pink floyd are some of the few that are more interested in making great music than keeping the fans happy and the record deals coming  this cd is an experiment in seeing how much strangers will get into the bands personal work  fortunately for pink floyd theyre such a great band that they can make a living out of this kind of idea  the wall isnt really a collection of different songs but rather a twisted musical that floors me every time i pop it in the cd player  as with all pink floyd albums i find it hard to describe the beauty and complexity within them so i urge you to just pick up a copy of one or more of their classic albums  i guarantee unless youre a slipknot redneck you will be hooked on pink floyd before the album youve bought is done playing|1
not much info in this cd  probably only 90 minutes long  what he said is what we already know  no new ideas|0
finally a great rush album no is not a return to the past is a great record form the modern day rush i hope the next one incorporates more synths and maybe more cowbell|1
people dont argue this record is a masterpiece its a masterpiece only if u know what does it really talk about if its pink floyds best or not thats a different subject and for the people who listen to todays crap like rb yuck and that sort of stupid music well stick to the things you hear and dont dare to talk about pink floyd its a blasphemy its a matter of iq mostly so i propose to take david gilmour and any pop star teen idiot that you like and put them to play guitar or give jennifer hlopez a guitar shell most probably think its a new type of microphoneget real people bands like pf yes camel kansas and so on are for the few people that like real music you wanna listen to lopez or britney then feel free i wouldnt want any fan of that kind listening to what i hear so keep awayas far as the album is concerned dont buy it unless you really like floyd concept albums and have an iq average that allows you to understand and comprehend two things lost in our days|1
i thought i was listening to country and western  and i dont like country and western  ive heard better hawaiian music in a john wayne moviei do not doubt these folks could play hawaiian music if they would let themselves gorather they opted to play some facsimilei dont even know what else you could call iti say forget it try another cd if you want hawaiian music  its certainly not this one  i wont even keep iti dont want it in my collection|0
check the online music sampler if you think you want to buy this  it is hard to relate to for 60 people  not saying it is bad just check|0
i heard of brian regan many many years ago i believe he did an hbo special with his brother about 15 years agoi hadnt heard much more about him in the years to come but he came to phoenix to do a show and i heard him on the radio so i bought his cd even though its a few years old alreadyi loved the cd and my wife laughed throughout it even though she tends to get bored listening to comedy cdsit contains mainly observational humor about growing up so i listened to it in the car while driving the family places and my kids love it too aged 11  6it is family friendly humor which is hard to findand it does wonders for long distance family road tripshe seems to be actively touring the comedy club scene i just wish he would put out a new cd soon considering this one is going on 8 years old now|1
ive only heard two of the songs before i was happy to find out that i like the entire cd its a consistant sound if you like one song youll like them all there is some cursing and blasphemy so if that bothers you dont bother i love it it rocks hard|1
i purchased this cddvd flyleaf album as a gift to my girlfriend and she was very happy this group is goodi give 5 stars|1
there isnt enough that i can say about this album  after purchasing the three previous studio releases strictly out of curiosity and the obligation of a fan boy i was pretty convinced that rush was a spent force whose most creative years were behind them  however like most everyone else i was surprised at the quality of this album  this album is a culmination of a band that has continually experimented with different arrangements musical styles and instrumentation over their four decade history  boy does it deliverfirst off this album isnt going to please every fan as some of these other reviews indicate  any band that has recorded different sounding albums as rush has is going to alienate somebody with anything they attempt after 40 years  however it is as close to a definitive rush album as anyone can expect  playing with their typical tight virtuosity and augmenting it with their strongest melodies in 30 years and a degree of playfulness normally reserved for their live shows rush have found the balance that many of their older fans like me have been yearning for  the band uses keyboards and strings again but sparingly adding just the right amount of colour and texture to the core threepiece guitarbassdrum ensembleas most listeners are aware clockwork angels is the bands first full fledged concept album  as a concept album it succeeds on every level  although songs can be enjoyed individually they work better in context of the album  each song adds a layer to the story loosely based on voltaires candide of an ambitious young man set to discover and conquer the world only to be met with resistance disappointment and misadventure  the naive excitement of caravan is augmented by the defiant and angry bu2b wistful halo effect brashness of headlong flight regret and despair of bu2b2 revelation of wish them well and the characters encountered in betweenuntil the wisdom and reconciliation of the garden completes the song cycle with grace and beauty  this may not be as complete of a concept album as tommy or the wall but nor does it contain throwaway tracks that only serve to advance the story like theres a doctor miracle cure stop or vera lynn  it is a lean 66 minute story of adventure selfdiscovery and realizationthis album delivers as complete a listening experience as radioheads masterpiece ok computer fifteen years ago  rush may have recorded better collections of songs on moving pictures permanent waves a farewell to kings or signals but they have never crafted a better album package  as for me i just cant get enough of this album  sure i prefer some songs to others clockwork angels the anarchist and the garden are career highlights but experienced in its entirety the whole is better than the sum of the parts|1
like probably 99 percent of the people who bought this digital abomination i thought this was a comedy album by david cross this david cross even named his godawful attempt at music tracks the way the comedian labels his tracks this was an album that hurt my ears hurt my brain and scarred my soul this man can play his instrument but has no clue as how to make music no one wants to hear his crap an alien from another planet would have a better understanding of how to entertain a human being with sounds i wish i could give it negative stars david cross the musician hates the world and desperately want it to hate him back this was an assault to anyone who ever enjoyed music|0
they all sound a bit high to me these are top guys but they dont shine on this album sorry not much good|0
a cute enough flick but not much of an album certainly not by beatles standards hey bulldog is the most interesting of the few new songs the original lp offered the first true stereo rendering of all you need is love but that no longer applies and george martin a true genuius of a producer possessed little talent as a film score composer apart from the lovely pepperland theres not much worth listening to in his contributions here all in all a pretty much expendable novelty from the beatles catalogue for completists only|0
johnny osbourne is one of my favorite reggae artists but his later stuff is really awful  its full of techno instruments that detract from any of the natural feel a syncopated beat that bores and really lack any quality control in terms of track selectionget the best of johnny osbourne and various other heartbeatstudio one albums and skip this one|0
this cd is a major disappointment thenarration by leonard bernstein is not the ogden nash version but a dull soporific lecture on the instruments absolutely bound to turn any child or young person off of music forever dont waste your moneyread the fine print carefully in order to obtain the traditional ogden nash narration the peter and the wolf is fine but there are as good versions to be found on other cds|0
flyleafs music is just amazing i can listen to any of their songs and just feel great this rerelease of their debut album includes great acoustic versions of some of their music you also get a dvd with some live performances and a free cell ringtone a great package for those who already bought and those who havent bought the original release|1
this album not only signifies a change in pink floyds musical approach but a change within the group itself this was to be the last floyd album in which the group would participate together as a whole tensions grew to an unbearable point with the members of floyd and the end of the the wall tour indicated the end of pink floyd as it was known many things happened within the group between the album and tourie wright but you can find the nitty gritty details elsewhere on the web and dont get me started with the final cutthe wall evokes so many feelings that it is understandable why it is one of the most successful albums to ever be released songs like mother goodbye cruel world hey you comfortably numb etc are so dark and dripping with emotion that you cant help but to be captivatedgranted like many have pointed out there is filler even so i have come to like every bit of the albumi encourage anyone who has not heard the wall straight through to give it a try and to those who have never listened to the wall to get yourself a copy of this brilliant piece of work|1
i dont know whats worse early beatles or late beatles all of these songs are so trite and silly its easy to see that the beatles were the hansons and the backstreet boys of their generation i think early beatles  is actually worse what with that hideous yeahyeahyeah and  those laughable suits this album is a decent early 60s sort of thing but  theres really not a memorable song on it and i just bet if it wasnt the  beatles then no one would be playing it todayby the way if you want a  version of the song money that isnt quite so slick sounding then get the  stones fazed cookies album|0
absolutely awful  a nonstop drone of static  i also purchased sounds of nature  waterfalls and it sounds exactly like ocean waves  static static static|0
for one thing two of the songs were released before pepper flying is annoying your mother is just this annoying jingle hello goodbye is catchy  and bad like commercial songs the title track sounds like trippedout military band music the rest is fine|0
dont buy this if youre looking for an authentic thunderstorm without any background annoyances the sqawking birds are loud and extremely annoying making it impossible to fall asleep to thisi love thunderstorm cds but this was painful to listen to it also takes a very long time for the actual storm parttime the beginning part sounds like a puddle slurping around not sure how to explain it doesnt sound bad in text but it made me feel on edge weird sounding i know if you like the repetitive squawk of birds then it may be ok|0
great gift thanks to my purchaser i really enjoy the music and will be able to continue listening for a long time|1
most of her material is just catchystrut for instance was better in 85 but is very dated sounding nowmorning trainfor your eyes only are solid adultcontempary stablesonly the prince penned sugar walls showcases  her youth and that song hasnt dated well eitherbut it was catchy just  like most of her stuff in the 80s|0
first things first spring for the deluxe edition the 2 bonus tracks are songs that feel like they should be on the regular album anyway and with them included the album clocks in at 6127 an hour is basically my ideal time a record should last the behind the scenes dvd which has a close up of the angeldemonguitar cover art on the disc  it looks sweet is only about half an hour long but being a musician myself i cant help but love it slash  the guys talk about various aspects of the record and working as a band only a few songs are discussed at any length but the best part is watching them playpractice which is done throughout the 30 or so minutes while watching slash play a concert is incredible watching him rehearse is equally awesome it just is the booklet has no lyrics which some people dont care about but im a lyricist as well as a guitarist so it does irk me a little myles isnt always the easiest singer to try to decipher ya knowalso it comes with a coupon thats redeemable online for a free tshirt which judging by the picture on the coupon is a white shirt with the album cover on the front in black  white i personally think its cool that its not in color cause im sure youll be able to buy that anywhere but you will have to pay shipping im in cali so it was about 5 still a great bonus especially for the price of the total package it expires 5212013 just so you knownow as for the tunes themselves it really is slashs best work since the original snakepit yeah better than the last album which was too diverse for my tastes though the guitar work was amazing as usual better than vr better than snakepit 2000 and i dont mean just guitar work i mean the songs themselves are better bold statement i know my favorite is hard  fast which im actually listening to as i type easily the most rockin song it feels like chuck berry on speed during a pornstar gangbang while driving 100 mph in traffic i dont know how else to describe it my least favorite though i dont hate it by any stretch is the next track which im now listening to as i type far and away the only real ballad on the album it certainly stands out and is kind of an awkward slowdown from the rest of it admittedly i love the phrasing of the solo as is the case with basically all these songs slash is going out of his way to not only not copy himself too much i say too much because a little here  there is inevitable but to raise his own personal bar and it shows great riffs great solos great songs thats really all you need to knowon a personal note its a shame that axl bailed on the rock n roll hall of fame induction ceremony because now its confirmed that there will never ever be a gnr reunion and as i listen to this record for the third time now  it just arrived today i cant help but think that these songs would be so much better coming out of axl but its probably better to not make the comparison so forget i said anything4 12 stars great rock nfn roll album  made even better by the timing of its release because this feels like an ideal summertime record buy this as soon as you can afford it and if you dont love it then dont claim to love rock n roll straight up|1
how the mighty have fallen i recently purchased the new beatles lp rubber soul and was startled to see how a long their hair is its literally resting on their ears i didnt even know hair grew that long and theyre not smiling you can tell if you look at their picture on the front cover of the lp when a camera takes your picture smilealso theyve lost all creative powers they used to sing about holding hands twisting and shouting dating girls who are just 17 now they sing about norwegian woods and nowhere man what is nowhere man i have no idea but i have a feeling superman would have no trouble beating him to a pulpand theres this crazy indiany music on this one too hey beatles youre american use american instrumentswith our boys off in nam fighting for us right now we dont need music like this we already have that miserable bob dylan to listen to with his tamborine man i guess another subpar superhero on every station on the am diallisten i dont need this i come home from work all i want is for my wife to hand me a drink and put the needle on a nice lp if thats what you want too gentlemen this isnt the lp for you|0
music  has a dreary quality kind of depressing  a few good songs but id say go with an album with more hits on it  these are rejects  later beatles suck with some exceptsions  sgt pepper was great but they kept going too far to try to be different and in later years the music was sick more like they were wanna bees trying to be differerent  instead of sgt pepper where they achieved it naturally  didnt care for this one but love most early stuff|0
few artists have ever been able to span the test of time and generations no matter what the genre  however michael w smith is definitely one of those rare artists whose albums although 25 years old for this one still reaches a new generation  personally i always thought the ones he wrote with his wife like hosanna on this one were their best  what a songwriting team they make  i bought this when it was first released and still have it  mwss ability to reach all ages even today just shows how much god can use a willing heart  highly recommend|1
in 1987 i bought this with naive anticipation  i knew this was the first watersless pf album but i didnt really realize what they had lost  it  does vaguely sound like a pf album but somehow its profoundly boring  it  is worthwhile in the sense you can properly judge the importance of roger  waters however it is a tedious listen  you may not like every pf album  but nobody can deny waters pushed himself lyrically and musically  gilmour  struggles to recapture a former sound causing himself  to artistically  speaking run in place  ive always tried to pinpoint the  major weakness on this disc from gilmours girlfriends uninspired lyrics  to the bands weak songwriting but its become futile  ive come to the  conclusion that there is no single weakness its simply a recording that  should never have taken place and in my mind its not even part of the pf  discography  the final cut is just that  anything that is post 1983 is  post pink floyd|0
i have a collection of at least 30 different christmas albums that i have bought over the years everything from frank sinatra to the macarena christmas ugh and everything in between  while many of these albumscds are wonderful nothing in my mind compares with the album put together by the carpenters  karen carpenter sings like an angel and will make every hair stand up on your body and bring tears to your eyes with her versions of ave maria ill be home for christmas silent night and more  her brother richard plays the piano throughout and his music is wonderfuleveryone that i know who owns this collection says the same thing  this is simply the best christmas album ever  i cannot recommend the carpenters christmas collection more highly  if you dont have it get it today  its too bad karen that angel was taken from us at such a young age|0
every track had to be adjusted for volumewhat a pain especially when drivingthere must be a way of automatically sensing volume to prevent this bm|0
i had the pleasure of receiving the fanpack 4 days in advance of the release date  in those 4 days i have listened to this several times and each time it gets better and better  i have been a rush fan since the beginning and each one of their records provides something different for me  this one is no exception  i must say that i have enjoyed every song on this album and will continue to do so  i feel that geddys vocals are spot on and their musicianship is second to none period|1
brian regan is great  he can take the simple everyday events or objects and make you laugh we have watched it several times|1
i agree with the opinion of one of the guest reviewers i have the original cast records of jacques brel with elly stone she is the voice to beat and this rerelease does not do that i was about to check out the  rest of my records but without an elly stone cd replacement of jacques  looks like ill have to do 33 13 for a while|0
great music by the beatles but record executives dont get it we dont want analog music converted to digital and then back to analog for use on vinyl lps it defeats the purpose of using analog tapes and the results on vinyl  sound just like a cd all the 3 dimensional warm rich sound of analog vinyl is gone these executives must be the like the executives in the 1970s who thought it was a good idea to use cheap bendable vinyl and then shrink wrap it guarantying warps right out of the package they almost killed the medium in the 70s a medium that has far better sound than a cd apple and other manufacturers are out of touch with what their customers want if they want to digitize why not put albums music only out on blueray at least then some audiophiles might then be happy with digitized music instead record companies continue to use the lowest medium for digital music cds why dont people buy cds sound matters|0
after reading the glowing review about this cds realism i was totally bummed when i got it it sounds like practically nothing but static i grew up next to the shenedoah river in va played around creeks and streams and the potomac all my life all this reminds me of is someone setting up a microphone at some rapids and going away for an hour maybe if youre into whitewater rafting this might make a relaxing recording but i was not amused|0
i first heard brian on sirius a few years ago i thought hey id like to hear more  the guy is sooo funny  good grief i laughed so hard  i have him on my ipod and let some other folks hear his comedy particularly stupid in school  you too and stuff his material had one person doing everything they could to keep from howling on the bus  i just downloaded his all by myself i laughed for almost 40 minutes  this guy is gifted funny imaginative  cleanfamily oriented  i had one person tell me that they wanted to get his material for listening on car trips with their child because his being clean and funny was something they could both enjoy  the guy is awesome if you like to laugh youre going to love this cant wait for the next cddownload|1
if you like the old good sound of candlemass 4 first albums then you  should have second thoughts about buying this one|0
this album sucks so bad its not even funny see i do this site a service most people only write 5 star reviews for stuff they like im different i seek out the stuff i hate ill just say this i actually like some of the material on dark side this album though is just garbage at this point you have a bunch of ego maniacs capitalizing on syd barrett i truly believe syd was a completely eccentric guy and he had a bent mind i also think he was incredibley gifted guy with a level of creativity that was unparralleled however at this point i think these guys were just promoting the myth and capatalizing on his illness the opener is a prime example of this with some of the worst lyrics ive ever heard coupled with some of the worst wanker guitar ive ever heard i also think listening to a song like welcome to the machine is an excercise in masochism personally id rather give myself eraser burns for anyone looking for direction this band was actually good at one point and id say start wpiper at the gates and then all of the early singles youll be blown away|0
this album is horrible gavins singing is worse than ever there is not even a decent song on the album not only is the singing bad but the lyrics are pitiful they make no sense at all  and the electronic music is awful  especially against gavins voice gavin needs to ask his girlfried gwen to  help him with song writing because gwen is an awesome songwriter but  unfortantely gavin is not this album is the worst one out of all bush  albums|0
this carmen is a miss on most cylinders sinopoli who should have been as great in the pit as ever conducts a listless often dragging reading lamore is almost an alto and her deep chocolate tones sound neither young nor seductive moser is a workaday tenor with nothing to offer interpretativelyhe just stood in because no one better was available i suppose all in all a disappointment in eveyr department|0
this is a very enjoyable recording that fits together very well the music and the storytelling life in the shtetls of eastern europe in the early 20th century and the other dialogue be it philosophical or a latke recipe interspersed and blending all togetherim very glad i purchased this cd  its spring now and it keeps making its way back into the cd carousel its a warm recording|1
our family grew up with roger whitakers voice anytime we were in the car  somehow i lost that recording which was about a quarter century old  therefore i worked diligently to find out which of his offerings were the real thing  that is original recordings with the original tempo  it was disheartening to find so many rerecordings done just enough differently to not bring out the wonder that was roger back in the 60s and 70s  we attended a concert about 6 years ago and found that not only did he not perform those wonderful oldies he was famous for but his interest was really more about his love and concern for his african countrymen  if he wants to sell he needs to bring back those original recordings|0

even if you disassociate the sequel with the original make no mistake about it folks grease 2  the movie was absolute pants the script was terrible the acting was dire the only plus point that saved the movie was the soundtrack and thats saying somethingfor those who have never heard the grease 2 soundtrack album before be warned its nothing like the travoltanewtonjohn original in fact apart from the photo on the cd cover youd be hard pushed to associate this album with a grease movie at allwhereas the original grease soundtrack was one of those ultimate feelgood albums i found the sequel to be rather boring in parts two of the main ballads charades and turn back the hands of time seem quite dark while the supposed upbeat tracks cool rider score tonight and prowlin just appear tediousunfortunately this cd is more of a miss than a hit the quality of the tracks range from average to downright abysmal it may have been meant as a comedy track but i defy anyone not to cringe with embarrassment while listening to the godawful reproduction and do it for our country isnt much betterscore tonight  another track laced with a plethora of sexual innuendos as are most of the songs on this cd  and rockahulaluau come close to matching the lesser known songs on the original soundtrack album whereas well be together sounds remarkably like a mellow version of we go together from the first movie also girl for all seasons is nothing more than a look at me im sandra dee reprise remake did the songwriters run out of ideaspersonally i thought michelle pfeiffer circa 1982 was a terrible singer those who disagree should listen to the fabulous baker boys soundtrack to hear what she sounded like later in her career the songs she performs on this cd cool rider turn back the hands of time along with her contribution to whos that guy were rather pitifulthe other two main actors in the movie were given a track each to perform maxwell caulfield does quite a good job on charades vocally but the actual song is rather depressing and adrian zmeds vocals on prowlin are sooooo bad its gotta be heard to be believedwhat saves this cd soundtrack from being an absolute turkey is the terrific opening number back to school again by the four tops is simply stunning more rock than pop this track imho is the best from both grease movies its just a shame the grease 2 movie and soundtrack goes downhill after thatgrease 2 was a monumental disaster for paramount pictures and the main reason for this was the soundtrack listen to both cds from movies 12 and discover for yourself lets just hope the proposed grease 3 will have learned from this mistakejon|0
we bought the raffi cd as a gift for our granddaughter  she is 3 months old and seems to love the music as much as my sons did when they were very young  the lyrics are timeless|1
i was kinda surprised how heavy this cd sounds they sound more like metallica than the rush of old i like rock and roll and this album was more like heavy metal i can hear moving pictures all day red barchetta is rock and roll the tempo changes and riffs are all classic rock this cd though is not a classic rock album and if anyone says it is doesnt know what they are talking about its not a put down im just stating my taste i do like the last 2 songs on this cd though they do have the classic rock sound  the band is great as usual geddys vocals were strong neils lyrics were awesome as ever its rush and ill listen to it and enjoy it but for me and my personal tastes of rush i long for the older albums of rock like 2112 signals grace under pressure ect i just found this cd too fast and too heavy maybe im the one whod getting too old and i want a more laid back sound for that reason i cannot give this a bad rating at all rush gets 4 stars |1
the reasons i like this album are the same as the reasons i hate it it bursts with musical talent and quality and a lyrical relevancy to some not all of the subjects explored at first the reason i liked the  wall was because of the story behind it blending the biographies of  roger waters with original floyd frontman syd barrett was an original and  impressive stroke at the same time the story is no different from other  rock operas of the time the character of pink floyd is a neurotic guy who  had too much childhood anguish too much fame too much sex and drugs and  he turns it into fascist violence that only gets glorified by the audience  who dont see it as the  lavish show that its supposed to be but rather  as a literal translation of hammering the dregs of societyie  waiting for the worms not to say the album is bad  another brick in the wall part 1 is simple yet impressive  david gilmours echoing guitar sound amazing and the lyrics while simple  are very thoughtprovoking another brick in the wall part 2 is  classic and the ending solo is probably gilmours best yet  comfortably numb hey you young lust  goodbye blue sky and especially run like hell are  the finest tracks on the album the wall was a very chancy and  personal endeavor for roger waters but while it proved successful  commercially and is full of musical excellence i think that its about  time roger waters stop bitching about everything it may provide him with  good musical ideas but how many different ways can you make subtle hate  rock either way get the album for the music the lyrics are clever  sometimes but overall its all for the music|1
this is another cd with philip glass songs being used from other full length glass recordings there are only a couple new songs and they are short and rather similar sounding to other glass music philip glass is being recycled too much|0
this album is going to go down as one of their best like power windows and moving pictures their choice to create a series of songs that tell a story was a great idea and works very well while the concept album is often derided it isnt the concept album itself that is a bad idea but that most concept albums are poorly executed because they are very difficult to do well rush has created a 2112 for the 21st century although they did not do a 20 minute song comprised of multiple movements but an album with many songs each conveying different parts of a journey from naive innocence to eye open well i wont put my spin on what i think the story is about the songs are wonderful and the use of full orchestra is done in a manner that enchances rather than distracts from the songs in which they are used i recommend this album whole heartedly i have been a fan since 1990 when a high school buddy first turned me on to rush by loaning me power windows i was blow away by both geddy lees vocal range and his bass stylings to say nothing of just how amazing the composition was and the fact that every instrument was the star and blended together seamlessly to create okay this was supposed to be a review of the album so i will stop gushing if you like rush youll love the album if you are new to rush i think that you will find yourself a fan after a few listens|1
as much as i love sailor moon do not buy this cd  the picture that this page shows is actually from the live action version of bishoujo senshi sailor moon called pretty guardian sailor moon  moreover this cd is of all the horrendous dubbed songs that helped butcher one of the best animes of the 90s  lyrics are beyond corny  dont waste the money  the japanese songs are far superior|0

it is well known that every questionable restaurant in the english speaking world has a copy of this record indeed certain commentators are known to judge the repute of a given restaurant on this single factfor nothing but nothing is guaranteed to expel straggling punters into the chill night air than a blast of these hoarse mediterraneans shouting their way through a foreign language version of my way and if that doesnt do the trick bamboleo surely willit rids the kitchen of vermine and wards off vampires tooolly buxton|0
this historical but disputable concert was apparently recorded by one of the spectators not enjoying a very good seat using a lowend reel to reel recorder sitting on his laptop you hear cough feet noises and eventually singing with a subfm quality you benefit from the entire lenght of applauses uncut i think it is just a shame that a record company released such thing|0
i love many of thompsons cds but this collection is not oneany of them  only buy this if you really like classical music  this would probably be excellent for background music in a store or at home but as a meditative setnope  not for me  thompson has so many other great meditative and calming cds try those first  sleepy ocean and sleepy rain are great  so is creative mind  and all four cds in brainwave suite i can recommend  but not this one unless you really really like classical music for meditation|0
a friend recommended this cd and i will always be grateful the lyrics are clever and entertaining the yodeling lesson will have everyone wanting to give it a try and there are some good songs here to yodel along with all three children enjoy it 86 and 3 we emailed a copy of the hilarious id love to be a cowgirl to my sister who is afraid of cows this is one of those few cds of childrens music that i enjoy over and over again too|1
i cant comment on the audio quality because i cant get it to play on my computer the file format is exe not wav or mp3 or ogg or any standard audio format i cant believe they used a proprietary exe format that only works with windows ive tried four different music players but the only thing that will play is the little video my computer cant see the audio files to rip them to my harddrive either the same holds true for the remastered sgt pepper cd very disappointededit i found a keyboard hack that allowed me to access the audio tracks in ogg format and rip them to my hdd so it can be done but nobody should have to spend hours researching the internet just to play a cd|0
ive always loved the dark side of the moon album and seeing waters and gilmour back together on stage at live 8 made me want to listen to the wall and let me tell you this is one of their best worksthe ultimate tragic rock star story told by one of the greatest classic rock bands of all time great rock anthems such as young lust another brick in the wall part one run like hell hey you and of course the happiest days of our livesanother brick in the wall part two combo combined with some other memorable tunes such as in the fleshon thin ice comfortably numb and mother make this a must own albumnow of course you have those weirder songs as the trial in the flesh the second one  and vera but they do not take away from this true rock opera to which the self proclaimed rock opera american idiot makes no comparisonplease floyd hear my pleago back on tour and liberate those held hostage by todays music with your greatness|1
this guided meditation has allowed me to find my happy place when i come up from meditation i am more able to cope with the everyday stresses in my life|1
alright heres my 2 cents about the new album after 45 listens nowproduction wise it is a loud lowfrequency heavy recorded album with deep bass guitar and bass drums so you may need to turn up the treble a bit  i have read some reviews with concerns about the sound quality and i can see where those are coming from however i definitely recommend listening on a high quality stereo system and speakersheadphones  i think the mix is great for the kind of music being played and i love how deep and upfront geddys bass is in the mix on this cdi have to admit it takes me a few listens on any new rush cd for me to get it and this one is no different  i dont think theres a band out there that switches tempos and parts of songs as well as these guys do where ideas seemingly comes in and out from nowhere and it takes a careful listen to really appreciate  so far my faves are clockwork angels the anarchist and carniesa quick rundown of my impressions of the trackscaravan and bu2b  not really new songs but both great hard rocking tunes  i loved hearing them on the last tourclockwork angels  reminds me of cygnusdouble agent a straight out rocker with frenetic drumming from the professor  real nice vocal work from ged as wellthe anarchist  great deep bass groove lots of twists and turnscarnies  love the chorus along with all the change ups and toward the mid to end of the song when it gets really heavyhalo effect  nice midtempo midalbum change of pace but probably my least favorite track due mostly because the rest of the album is so stellar7 cities of gold  heavy bluesy tune with a malignant narcissism riff in the opening this one has not quite grown on me all the way  yetthe wreckers  not sure how to describe this one other than its simply a beautiful song  i cant get the chorus out of my headheadlong  an instant classic an awesome heavy rocking winding tune  neil just beats the hell out his kit on this one  awesome bass line and incredible lead from alex and i love the main monkey business riff after alex solo  it reminds me of some early stuff like bastille day and bytorwish them well  another heavy midtempo diamond in the rough in my opinion  although the background vocal on this one is simplistic it fits nicelythe garden  this one reminds me of something that geddy produced off his solo recording with the opening acoustic guitars  its probably the finest ballad they ever recorded and unlike anything ive heard from the boys  just a beautiful song  gives me chillsin closing i have to give this one 5 starts but of course the real judgment of this recording will be how it stands the test of time vs other rush recordings  i do wish an instrumental would have been included on this album as these guys are the masters in that department but anyway i do hope they play the entire album on the upcoming tour  furthermore its nice to see all the rush fans take the time to give their perspectives on the long awaited new album as i enjoyed reading the varying positive and negative opinions|1
while technically daniel smith is a good bassoonist his playing lacks musicality  additionally i find his tone harsh to the ear and it lacks the refinement that better bassoonists have  the bassoon is a magnificent solo instrument and i strongly recommend the solo playing by milan turkovic otto eifert or klaus thunneman over that of smith if you are looking to learn more about the bassoons solo repertoire  while there are many solo bassoonists out there the key is finding one who has the technique musicalness and darker tone quality that all bassoonists myself included strive for  unfortunately smith does not belong in this elite few|0
pink floyd is one of those like em or hate em bands  their music is very atmospheric orchestral and dark  in other words it aint pop  so if you prefer peppy little ditties about dancing and sex or if you want christianrock lite then stay awaythat said this is arguably the best pink floyd album  every song seems to be placed perfectly in order and the tracks flow wonderfully  even another brick in the wall part 2 which is overplayed sounds good  goodbye blue sky and the trial pull emotions out of youthe guitar is amazing the singing is powerful and the lyrics are slightly disturbing  the subject matter may not win any awards for originality he hates his mother and war is bad got it but it is so much deeper than most other albums released then or now the songs work much better with the video included ie the movie but its still powerfulthis is not party music housecleaning music or anything like that  opera is meant to be listened to and appreciated  this is rock opera and it should be given similar appreciation  and unlike many drugaddled bands this is not a jam bandif you like pink floyd then you must buy this album  if you dont know pink floyd this is a great way to start  if you hate pink floyd then write one bad review and stop  we dont care if you live in heavens realm or sweet gardens or whatever  this isnt a message board  its a review column  state your opinion and move on  please|1

i have found this cd and book set very helpful to start learning the lakota language  some of the reviews dont like the fact that the cd is all in lakota without english  well if youre are too lazy to pull out the book and sit down with the cd thats your own problem  the illustrations in the book along with the words are excellent  it gives you a visualization in your mind of the words you are trying to learn  i studied spanish in high school and college and find this volume on par with textbooks i used for that course work  maybe even better  the tendency i believe for anyone learning a new language is to try and learn everything at once  this book keeps it simple  each chapter deals with a different topic and subsequently builds on previous chapters  i found the pronunciation guide very useful  i would highly recommend this book along with the companion cd for anyone starting to learn lakota if your willing to put a little time and effort into your education|1
because truely i found this one of the most maddeningly awful movies ever made  ive sat through worse movies second crow movie anyone but what made this one so agitating is the quality of the first two just to follow into the lameness of this onei dont mean to step on the toes of the people who enjoyed this one but honestly i dont even understand how this one could possibly be ranked over 1  21 and 2 had some really nice stories based around an interdimensional s  m cult  this one starts off interestingly enough but spins off into a ridiculous straight ahead horror flick with some ironic deathmutations on the characters im not gonna explain that i hate it when people ruin things for me if you see the movie youll understand them if you choose wisely to see something else youll do better to forget this mess altogether that are just sillythis is simply a regrettable road for one of my favorite movie villains of all time|0
il be briefjust go and get the yellow submarine songtrack from 1999 a vastly better value and listening experience it contains the band tracks from this cd plus lots of other tracks from the fabs psychedelic era the tracks were superbly remixed and remastered at abbey road in 1998 these give the mind a glimpse of what the beatles catalog might sound like remastered|0
the original grease with olivianewton john and john travolta had some of the best songs in moviemusicals and most memorable characters not to mention a successful soundtrack but they slipped up on the second set of songs though there are a few stand out tracksmichelle pfieffer has a great voice putting it to work on what are easily the best songs on the cd cool rider and love will turn back the hands of time other memorable tracks are reproduction and girl for all seasons the other songs were boring corny or cleshaed if for nothing else buy the soundtrack or movie for cool rider or you could just pick up the original youre getting more for your money anyways  c |0
i first heard some of the music to les miserables at a concert i recently went to and i was so impressed that i bought the cd a few days later to hear the rest of the songs as it turns out the concert songs were editedthese were not if you can excuse songs devoted entirely to conversations between prostitutes and their customers frequent mild bad words quite a few inappropriate references and a complete disregard for gods namethen youll probably like this cd as to the musicwell there are a few songs that are pretty and others that are inspiring especially look down and do you hear the people singand then there are some that consist entirely of nearly spoken words set awkwardly to music i know i sound like im beating the cd upi just dont want anyone else to spend 20 on this cd just to find that its not really appropriate and shelve it as i have done|0
this album is typical of everything wrong with contemporary christian music  jumping from style to style carman attempts story songs ballads hip hop and traditional gospel without doing any of them wellthe lyrics are utterly juvenile asking listeners to get alive with god addicted to jesus and dance the holy ghost hop  his song satan bite the dust reveals his blackwhite thinking he evidently believes the alcoholism is caused by demons  how does he attempt to defeat such demons  by being authorized and deputized to blow them clean awaythis is possibly one of the worst albums ever released amounting to little more than religious cheerleading sloganeering and pandering|0
ive owned this album since i bought the tape in 1989 and have listened to it every christmas since  pulling it from the case is usually the first sign christmas is close  i cant think of a better tradition  last year we saw michael w smith live for a christmas concert in dallas tx and it was a true highlight  this is a great cd|1
this album is 100 rushit rocks in the best way possible rush just doesnt age they keep getting better and they rarely disappoint cant wait to see them in concert again because they are amazing live the title track is my fav and the two tracks that were previously released are also standouts|1
this is so dated in terms of electronica sugar is sweeter is the only good song otherwise everything else is generic|0
in a time when kids are listening to pop stars and exposed to lyrics that are not appropriate for them raffi is even more valuable  i bought his cds for my niece  we share certain songs with each other and even made our own dance routine  it is something very special to share|1
first off im not a beatle hater or basher and i do understand their importance in music and cultural history but im also not a fan yes they were big back in the day but now they just sound very dated but the older generation still keeps pushing them on us yes they do have some good songs but not on this album most of them are kindda childish sounding like this cd was aimed at children towards the end the songs are very very short like they came up with a little tune that couldnt become a whole song so they just stuck those unfinished songs on the album i think the song maxwells hammer is funny because the lyrics are about maxwell killing people with his hammer while the music to the song is very happy anyways the beatles were 1 back in the 60s but we now have much more to offer in the ways of music there are also good bands from the 60s though like the who and the beach boys|0
given pink floyd were much younger when they did the wall so that album was more extreme and rush is now much more mature so the lyrics are not psychotic like those of roger waters but i see many similarities in the concept of this album i urge everyone to read along with the lyrics in the excellent little booklet that comes with this for the first 1 or 2 listens and view the awesome illustrations which by the way paint a very good picture of the mood of this music younger fans wont see it but those fans like me who grew up with rush and are about the same age as the band will relate to the lyrics a lot better the theme of this album like the wall is at times introspective and dark expressing the alienation and cynicism that come with growing olderbelieve in what were told until our final breath while our loving watchmaker loves us all to deathan early promise that somehow died a missing part of me that grows around me like a cagesometimes the angels punish us by answering our prayersa man could lose his life in a country like this sunblind and friendless frozen and endlessall i know is that sometimes you have to be wary cause sometimes the target is youbelief has failed me now life goes from bad to worseand at other times it is reflective back upon the lessons and regrets of our youthfor all those years i had to get along they told me i was wrongwhat did i do fool that i was to profit from youthful mistakesi learned to fight and learned to love and learned to steal i wish that i could live it all againmusically it is flawless as is typical with rush guitars and drums rocking hard through most of the songs except the seemingly overlooked gem the garden which is a beautiful ballad there is not a single weak song they are all strong so it is hard to pick a favorite but i guess so far mine is seven cities of gold which has an almost zeppelinish sound to itmy only complaint a minor one as others have pointed out is that although it rocks hard and sounds great loud it would be better if it had a bit more dynamic range there are some parts where geddys vocals are almost drowned out by the guitars so i think when mixing it they could have lifted him up just a bit higher above the instruments understand i think this is only a minor problem and the album still sounds greatthose who dont like it at first give it at least 5 listens many albums are weird that way actually you need to hear them several times until you really hear what the musicians are playing and saying especially with concept albums i remember when i first heard the wall i thought it was awful but later on all of a sudden it just blew me away that is when for me all the songs started to become recognizable from each other and i heard the real strength of this album im not going to sugar coat it and call it a masterpiece like some did i think thats exaggerating a masterpiece only comes in 1 out of 1000 albums at best like the wall or tommy by the who perhaps if rush had added a few more songs made it a 2 disc set and done a little better mixing this would be a masterpiece but it is still an excellent album different from but among their best ever the mood of this album is serious personal and mature so especially you younger kids dont expect to hear the uplifting high vocals like fly by night or tom sawyer but i think most of us who grew up with rush will really love this album although it really rocks i wouldnt refer to it as a kickass or fantasy album it is a more realistic but beautiful and brilliant work of music from a wellseasoned mature band i see it as similar to a nonpsychotic version of the wall except time is the enemy rather than alienation and the clockwork angels can at times be more like demons bringing us closer to death which brings to mind a lyric from another pink floyd song time shorter of breath and one day closer to death i recommend reading the booklet at least once because if you cant relate to the excellent lyrics and images youre missing half the beauty of this magnificent journey through life and all the emotions that we feel along the way enjoyps  teres if youre out there sorry you had to miss that concert back in la   get this one and keep rockin with rush girl and give me a shout |1
this is floyds greatest just for comfortably numb and another brick in the wall this album is worth buying they are both classic floyd and gilmours guitar solos are wonderful buy this one now|1
i never recieved this dvdi emailed the seller and all he wanted was my zip codewhich i sent to himi have emailed him three times but never recieved my purchuse i am on a fixed income and wanted it to give as a gifti am very disappointedlois eddy|0
its epic each song is well crafted and amazing to listen to this will be yet another rush album that wont get old to listen to even after the millionth time theyve outdone themselves the only thing i dont like so much is the mixid like a little less bass and a little more treble especially since sometimes i can hardly hear pearts symbols over the rest of the instruments otherwise this album is amazing and it leaves me wanting more rush ps my wife who doesnt like rush wanted a copy of this album for her car that is saying a lot|1
the white album seems to have been made in a basement or other nonstudio with extraneous noises pops and clicks  many of the songs are experimental and not memorable|0
i dont think i have taken it out of my cd player since i got it the sound is riveting and full of emotion you can hear their testimony through each song and even on the more darker songs they always melodically speak of a hope and a strong belief in how god can heal you through the pain the songs are real and raw highly recommend|1
was so looking forward to getting this album was not pleased slashs first album amazing really this one not so much only enjoyed 3 of the tracks and that sucks because i was so happy that he was making another album so do check it out before you buy this one sorry slash|0
i have not heard the wall in over a decadei got this deluxe packaging digitally remastered set  it is much better nowpink floyd was and is so progressive|1
i admit i slipped clockwork angels into the player three weeks ago with low expectations  steampunk has kind of come and gone rush came to the party about 10 years late  and a concept album  make that 20 years  add to this the gimmickry of simultaneously releasing a novel based on the same concept and it was easy to presume that the trio had finally burnt out and just phoned this one in milking the cash cow one more time before hanging up the picks n sticks for goodwas i ever wronga decade or two from now when the definitive history of this band is written i suspect clockwork angels will stand as rushs finest hour  folks this album is good listenahundredtimesover good  bestalbum grammy good  darksideofthefreakingmoon good really good the bombast of snakes and arrows is mostly absent here replaced by a musical breadth and depth every bit as powerful but far more complex and emotive  this is one of the very few albums you can listen to over and over again discovering something new each time  a good set of headphones is recommended  messrs lee peart and lifeson are all in top form passing the lead around while executing complex transitions and tempo changes with an ease that must be heard to be believed  there isnt a single weak track in the lot and all twelve songs aside from the transitional bu2b2 stand well on their ownthey also stand well as a whole  unlike many concept albums this one music and lyrics alike tells a real coherent story and a halfway decent one  in fact its a story you can read in detail in thecompanion novel  i referred above to the concurrent release of the novel as a gimmick and maybe on some level it is but it turns out to be a bold creative and unique afaik one that although not as strong as the album generates a surprising amount of synergy with it  if you like the album and you will youll like the book and youll find the pair more than the sum of its partsit is nothing short of aweinspiring that after almost 40 years and 20 albums rush are making music like this  geddy alex and neil thank you  five stars with coldfire diamond clusters|1
i follow a lot of comedians but brian regan is still my favorite  i play this cd whenever i have a long drive and it still cracks me up  brian regan is a comedic genius  his greatest ability is to take everyday happenings and put a hilarious spin on them  brians timing and delivery are also perfect  many times you laugh not just because of what he says but also how he says itits hard to compare brian regan to anyone else because he really has his own style  i dont want to ruin any punchlines so ill just give you one of his throwaway lines my friend told me he wears glasses only when he drives  how does that work  he steps out of his car and goes i can see  its beautifulit really doesnt matter what your tastes are brian regan is one of the few comedians who can crack everyone up  do yourself a favor and buy this cd now  youll be glad you did|1
classic rock sound and the signature sounds of joe satriani and sammy hagar  personally i could enjoy it if joe just cuts loose on a song or two and does some wild freestyle soloing but the classic rock sound is working for them too  seen these guys on their first tour and had a blast  go see them if you have a chance|1
it is beautiful harp music  very relaxing  the only problem is that we received a defective product from the seller  it always skips on selections 10 and 11  this is most annoying  the company sent me a second one and it is the same  they tell me that they have sold hundreds of them without a problem  i dont understand this  i have tried the cds on a number of players with the same result so i dont believe it is the player  after a third call to the company and a bit of discussion we were promised a new specially made copy which we are waiting for  we really love the music and hope we can get a good copy  we had borrowed one from our local library and it worked perfectly|0
this cd set was so useful to me that i got a copy for my sister valuable for those who are exploring their lives and the meaning of their lives i recommend it|1
its obvious that this is beautiful music but this recording is very poorly engineered either the wrong microphones were used or they are placed too far from the singers allowing the ambient resonance of the space to destroy the clarity of the vocal lines  in writing this spare clarity of both instrumental and vocal lines are essential to the recordings success  this is especially regrettable since there are so few recording currently available|0
words cannot express how amazing an album this is i dont know how rush could ever top this one i have my alltime favorite rush songs from the past but this is by far my favorite rush album every single song knocks my socks off i cant say that about any other rush album there are always a few great songs but not all of them are killer like they are on this albumthere is nothing that i do not like about this effort guitars excellent drumming excellent production beyond excellent geddy lees voice better than ive ever heard him and can we talk about his bass playingsound yeah im a bass player ive never heard such a great rock tone anywhere geddy gets the nastiest ballsiest tightest crunchy jbass tone ive ever heard out of him its the perfect tone for this kind of rock his playing is impeccablemore so that his usual greatness his lines are jawdropping astoundingthis album is a contender for my favorite rock album of all time from any artist dare i say rush has reached their brand of rock perfection with this one|1
the voice of the lead singer as well as the lyrics make this a great album great guitars as well|1
what sets rush apart from all the other aging rock bands is they write songslyrics that people of all ages can relate to because they challenge you think they are mature but youthful  these three guys actually peart writes all the lyrics are not just writing songs about the usual fair that we find in rock lyrics ie sex partying silly anthems not that there is anything wrong with that but lets all admit that it gets a little nauseating when a band is in their fifties or sixties and they are still trying to act like they are fifteen  its actually kind of sad isnt ityet rush has also made the choice not to spend all of their time in ballad land like many older rockers tend to do  randy newman once referred to many older artists reverting to ballad land when they are trying to appeal to a grownup audience or maybe they just ran out of good ideas  instead like robert plant u2 and peter gabriel rush is aging rather gracefully while still maintaining an edge and they prove this on clockwork angelsthe songs on clockwork angels are ingenuous and full of positive energy  from start to finish this is a timeless album by rush each song carries its own weight and adds color to the story being told  there are even a few radio friendly songs in the mix the wreckers wish them well and headlong flight wish them well is almost danceable and the melody just wont stop  there is a lot of variety on this record so you can play it extensively without getting tired of it  get it|1
i was very fascinated and overwhelmed with the jacket illustrations and art but i am very disappointed at the quality of these pressings myself being an audiophile and i own a hiend audiophile system retail valued  1500000 magical mystery is supposed to 180 grams it isnt its more like 150 grams more or less i noticed as soon as i felt the girth because i do own many 180 gram virgin vinyls of all genres so i dont know if that was a factory mistake or is it a fact or fiction as i read on amazoncom that each and every record is supposed to have been tested in abbey road labs before packaging and sent to stores the sgt peppers is 180 grams but it falls short because i do own the original sgt peppers on capitol label stereo and mono versions that are very valuable these new versions are supposed to be virgin vinyls meaning the soundstage his and lows and warmth should be better than the originals they sound like cds and if i had read the fine print on the sticker on the front in the beginning that these versions were taken from digital masters i would have never got em analog should be true analog thats is my opinionthe ram album reviewsit lacked quality and the album art was so plain i want to be satisfied i am not i work hard for my money and with the economy as poor as it is i cant afford to waste my funds in this case my money was wastedso please do not waste your money on any beatles related recordsvinyls i tried contacting customer service from beatlescom and they couldnt help me which means they dont care about there customers |0

this is not necessarily a seasonal cd we listen to it often in our home yearround the song all is well is amazing   the solo sung in the beginning by the young boy is touching to say the least im not a big fan of mw smiths vocals although he is tolerable cant get past that he sounds like elmer fudd regardless i bought the cd due mainly to the boys choir  extremely talented group|1
i had never heard of raffi prior to this purchase and quite a few of the songs i had not heard before i was surprised to find my little boy singing trying to with the music right away we definitely recommend this album by raffi|1
i remember hearing this album when it first came out in 69 or so it has one good song as i remember can you see her eyes but the rest of the album just plain sucks  dont waste your time on it i remember hearing this group in a club on long island and didnt think much at the time the illusion released another album called if its so a year or two later which was an improvement but still not up to what other bands were doing at the time|0
here we have one of those choices between great sound and great performance  this 1950 broadcast is wonderful yes but there is little humor in the performance only cloe elmo as dame quickly sounds like shes having any fun  on the other hand the astounding 1937 salzburg performancenow newlyremastered with quite acceptable sound see toscanini  the salzburg experience vol 4 falstaffhas life wit and whimsy along with outstanding singing  also dino borgioli the fenton on the salzburg set is the best on records while the singer in this 1950 performance is quite terribleif you want a good performance you will listen to a few times buy this version  if you want a timeless performance that will reveal new hidden beauties every time you put it on spend the extra 10 for the salzburg experience|0

ive been a rush fan ever since my brother brought home kings from big n in watertown  ny during the fall of 1977  i was hooked i threw away my kiss albums and readied myself for the onslaught of yes king crimson and the likes  rush was different and never claimed to be the it group  theyve always marched to their own drummer no pun intended and im glad to have been along for the ride all these fine years  clockwork angels is a masterpiece for them and perhaps a signpost for things to come  just listen|1
pink floyd in my opinion is quite simply one of the greatest rock bands of all time there style is all there own and has not yet been successfully duplicated this cd proves that the wall defines who pink floyd  is musically speaking of course this cd is only a beginning i recommend  all of pink floyds cds im sure they will be enjoyed as thoroughly as  the wall|1
an incredible album for a band thats been around nearly 40 years  from caravan to the garden clockwork angels might be rushs best work  yes geddy lee doesnt have the voice he once did  but in the scheme of things his voice is much more mature and accessible than his banshee days which helps propel the story of a young mans journey through lifes adventures that much more  the musicianship as always is incredible but there is something that rush really hadnt developed until later in life a groove  many of the songs just groove especially the almost sexy sounding seven cities of gold  the garden is an absolute gem a beautiful reminder that its all about how we live our life and the kind of people we are more so than the things we may have accomplished  its a measure of a life should be every persons mottoclockwork angels is a must have not only for rush fans but for any fan of rock that may be looking for something much more rich in depth and rocking than any of the top 40 drivel that is constantly shoved down our throats|1
here we go again on another journey in a masterfully crafted concept album and rush as a band moving in another directionjust take me there im ready for the ridea perfect marriage of music and wordsthank you  geddy alex and neil|1

i like a great deal of bernsteins beethoven but this ninth is not one of his successes first the sound is tubby and bloated lacking in definition and detail then lenny barrels through the first two movements without any of his customary conscious striving for effect and gives a general impression of a defect i never expect to find in him boredom phrasing in the opening movement is choppy and perfunctory  and the molto vivace sounds simply rushed as if bernstein needed to catch the last train home and although i suppose it has a certain perky momentum beethovenian grandeur is in short supply conversely the adagio is slack and laboured  but worse is to come the final movement is simply horrible  and not just because the soloists are so egregiously poor norman scott sounds way beyond his yellby date and the tenor iswell dont take my word for it you just have to hear him  but please dont part with any money to do so it is not always the case that unknown names bring disappointment but in the case of the tenor and mezzo the ungenerous verdict justly neglected comes to mind martina arroyo  a singer i generally admire greatly  does her reputation no favours here she simply gets through it in the same spirit as the new york philharmonic who must have known that this was not going to be their finest hour the juilliard school chorus sounds like a bunch of amateur hacks tenors bawling gamely ragged entries all over the place sopranos squawking incongruously  though matters do improve in the fugueok i admit it i havent the heart to comment on the fidelio overture as who cares whether its good after so dispiriting a performance of the main work i have no sympathy with the way harold c schonberg systematically trashed bernstein in his new york times reviews during lennys tenure in the 60s but if he caught this performance it would have been grist to his mill as a bernstein devotee i urge you to give this one a miss and go for a really great performance such as the live klemperer at the royal festival hall in 1957 see my review or fuumlrtwaumlngler at lucerne in 1954 his last  again see my review or one of the great karajan studio recordings|0

to be a fan of rush is to appreciate unparalleled musical virtuosity  clockwork angels delivers all of rushs trademarks  theres the intricate riffing the seamless time and tempo changes as well as pearts acrobatic drumming  let us not ignore the deep lyrics geddys bass shredding atmospheric vocals and lifesons out ofthisworld guitar playingthis is the first concept album they recorded sincehemispheresin 1978 unlikehemispheresand2112 the songs on clockwork angels arent segued together  each stands alone as part of the account  also different is the fact that the entire album is the story not just one side or the first part of the disk for those who werent around for vinyl  the boys did a fantastic job of reviving a format they had not attempted in 34 yearsthis chronicle teams neil peart up with sciencefiction writer kevin j anderson  its a steampunk piece about a traveler who leaves home and stumbles through a series of misadventures  it has a familiar rush theme ie the optimistic free thinking individual in a world of tyranny  i look forward to andersons september 2012 release ofclockwork angels the novelin novel formcaravan begins the saga as the traveler embarks on his journey  he cant stop thinking big  there are some long instrumental passages and its good to hear big al play some blazing solos again  bu2b is about faith  it starts out moody then starts rocking hard  the title track is another tune that switches between hard and soft in a heartbeat as only rush can  theres some busy noodling going down on the anarchist  the song is highlighted by the professors killer drum licks and lifesons sinister psychedelic solo guitar tone  halo effect is destined to be the bic lighter track on the album  it starts out soulfully acoustic  its a slow tempo dare i use the dreaded term power ballad  the chorus of the wreckers really strikes a chord with me  be wary indeed of miracles that are too good to be true  theres nothing worse than hoping and praying for salvation only to get exploited in return  how many people have been swindled by evangelists and socalled selfhelp gurus  headlong flight is another uptempo buttkicker  this is the earworm song for me as it seems to be stuck in my head  im going to go ahead and say that its my favorite track on the album so far wish them well is all about turning the other cheek something we need a little more of these days  the garden brings the traveler full circle and is another bic ballad  its message you reap what you sowart director hugh syme also deserves his props for doing an exceptional job with the packaging  in a time of inexpressive digital downloading its nice to know that some bands care enough to still put together a cool packaged booklet to go along with their music  included with the lyrics is a brief blurb that helps narrate the story  the booklet also features stunning steampunk illustrations throughoutif youre a hardcore fan is there really any other kind of rush fan you already own or are about to take delivery of clockwork angels  for the few of you who are borderline fans buy this cd  you will not be disappointed  as geddy lee said in a past interview fans will love it  critics will hate it|1
its good to hear these well known hymns and anthems that i hear in church on a continuing basis thanks|1
i remember this was the cool album that all the stoners and high school kids listened to and analyzed to death way back when i will always think of pink floyd as one of the most overrated rock groups of the 70s some of the songs on the wall were just okay but really the whole thing is one drawnout tedious experience for insecure high schoolers to cling to as the greatest rock album ever give me a friggin break eventually you graduate from high school and grow up and move on to better things including better music  people who still praise the wall album as the best thing in the world are just stuck in the past i cant think of any group more depressing overblown overhyped slow and boring as pink floyd 90 of their material will either put you to sleep or just depress you or put you in a bad mood dark side of the moon is another overrated overhyped project that was a 70s staple on classic rock radio this is one group i would be happy if i never heard one song from ever again pink floyd is a group you need to be stoned to listen to anyway and i can think of 500 other cds id rather hear stoned than anything by pink floyd im glad to hear that they were on a recent university list of the most overrated and overhyped rock groups ever i totally agree 100|0
i agree with the other reviewer for this cd single about this actually turns out to theres three songs here being strictly for cramps completists track listing ultra twist 349 confessions of a psycho 300 and no club lone wolf 228 im guessing these came of the 94 flamejob cd ill always much prefer to purchase a full length cd im sure i aint alone on that|0
i bought this cd because i wanted some bellydance music to dance to i didnt like any of the tracks on the cd and i found it difficult to dance to this is of course a question of taste and preference but i prefer the rytmic style of bellydance music i wouldnt recommend this cd to anyone|0
most of the critics consider sgt peppers lonely hearts club band as a fundamental album in the modern musics history and i totally agree but if i had to choose the best album ever released it would  certainly be pinkfloyds the wall i came across this album for the very first time somewhere around  198586 and at the time i didnt know much about existentialism i liked  the songs of this album but nothing more its some months later that i  began to read some existentialism works by jpsartre heidegger etc and  only then i got what roger waters was talking singing about the music is  so sad but the lyrics are even sadder bob dylan jim morrison and many  others sang about the wall here representing the human society as a whole  and how it effects or determines the life of everyone of us but walters  work is surely the deepest|1
the energy of peace and devotion in the songs is very high a devotee of paramhansa yogananda and his lineage of param gurus will surely find these songs close to ones heart|1
im a big admirer of claudio arrau  some of his discs including his 1950 recordings of all the chopin preludes no longer available are great and unique interpretations  however the present cd has to be one of his worst efforts in the catalog  as the previous reviewer noted on the fouth etude of op 10 in csharp minor arrau cautiously plays this presto as though it were allegretto  but its about more than just speed  he misses the dynamics the accents the colorations that make these pieces dramatic  arrau seems either unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the shape and flow of these works  everything is rather awkward  there are also moments such as in the majestic etude no 11 of op 25 winter wind where he is not only decidedly tentative and nonstormy but his fingers slow down to navigate tricky passages dissipating all tension  not surprisingly hes better in the most introspective and slow etudes where his beautiful tone discernable even here in this poor recorded sound and expressive use of pedal allow him to render mysterious shapes and shadows  but when the music calls for sforzando when fingers must be fleet when the fire must rage arrau cant deliver the goods and gives us a very creaky and uncertain performance  he honestly sounds in spots like he was just learning some of these works that day as they were recording them  this is a surprising situation from someone i regard as a great artist  but even in joseph horowitzs book conversations with arrau these works are skipped over when discussing the high points of the pianists discography  hear arrau for the beethoven 4th concerto though not the last tepid recording with colin davis hear him for his appassionata his beethoven opp 109 and 110 his lizst trancendental etudes and his debussy preludes but here go with someone elsethe trouble is i couldnt recommend a great complete set  finer recordings than this can be found by pollini matsuzawa and even gasp perahia but ive never heard a complete set thats really been satisfying  this is music that is more than 150 years old and has yet to find the definitive recording  richter tantilized us with blazing performances of some of the etudes josef lhevinne made great recordings of a few cziffra and argerich both gave us highly caffeinated complete sets and of course cortot made famous recordings of a number of them which i dont quite like as much as the rest of the world does overall however the dicography here is lacking  the great complete set of chopin etudes has yet to be made|0
the subject matter on many of these songs is a bit darkerserious and more complex than their first release but the hook and groove on most of the tracks curls the lip and makes the head nod  the guys really visit their roots and it shows in many of the riffs joe has provided  backup vocals with michael seem to be focal point throughout as well which is fine by me production is slick and polished tracks that shine are 3 12 letters spoken word which jumps off the beaten path a bit but really connects  sammys voice has held up remarkably well for all the years of belting it but it does seem a bit strained a time or two joe is joe bow down and grovel dubai blues is straight up taught by pros listen and learn bigfoot in noncomplicated fun up next  awesome hook and joes solo brings back a lot of good memories and makes me smile know that every track isnt a headbangers wet dream the foot show a mature tempo on a lot of the tracks if you are expecting something new and completely different pick it up someday but if you are a fan of sammy and boys that make up the foot this album will not disappoint|1
most of the comedians out there today use too much bad language and sexual humor it is great to see a funny comedian who everyone in the family can listen to this cd is hilarious it is my all time favorite comedy cd almost all of the tracks are extraorinary get this cd today|1
a very good hard rock record myles and slash make a great combination  one of the better rock albums ive heard in a while  some of my favorites are anastasia one last thrill title track standing in the sun and youre a lie  liked it so much im going to see them live  rock on slash|1
i do not know that my favorite floyd songspieces are on this cd  i love wywh the album and meddle equally  but in my opinion this cd outshines dsotm easilytaken as a complete work as it ought to be this is clearly a work for the ages  this will not be forgotten  every few years new kids discover the experience of listening to the wall and this will surely continue for the rest of timethe point is not that this  chararacters alienation is oh so special or outside of the realm of ordinary human experience  the point is that it is very much inside the realm of ordinary human experience  a cheery outlook on life  no but i think that most of us have been there at one time or another  that this alienation was committed to tape is the beauty  the lyrics the music and the scope of the message to the world is what will set this cd apart for all timebtw if someone has a serious critique of a piece of artmusic it would serve their purpose to try to not sound like a total moron|1
an amazing album  actually better than the first album  the band has really jelled together and the music is tight|1
it actually scks much better than a hoover  anybody who rates this album with 5 stars either needs serious consultation with a psychologist or consider it a soundtrack album to an imaginary movie called suicidal tendencies  the final cut is the worst album by anybody at any time  it is dreary drab gloomy depressing morose creatively desolate to say the least which are the best compliments i can think of  it is made up mostly of throw away tracks not included on the wall  legitimate since its imaginative insightful value is right up there with flushing a loaded toilet  it wasnt pink floyd it was roger waters who had assumed control of the band in the joyous method of coup detat  it was a painfully obvious love affair with ego  is there a better way to sell ones personal creation even if its musical sludge than with the name pink floyd on it  would anybody have rated this album 5 stars if it was by an unknown band called chucker and the upchuckers  at the time if i were with pink floyd i would have presented mr waters with 2 options either take a very long walk on a short pier or go to the nearest highway turn left and never come back|0
see title this has been around forever and everybody thats going to be interested in buying it must have heard it before|1
this was genesis first album recorded when they were teenagers at the charterhouse school the british equivalent of a prep school  they were more of a folk ensemble than rock group at that point hardly able to do more with their guitars than strum  peter gabriel tony banks and mike rutherford were already on board with anthony phillips on guitar and john silver on drums  they sent demo tapes to producer jonathan king hoping to parlay a songwriting career and found that king preferred to have the boys record their own songs  after which he slapped a bunch of orchestration on it hoping for a success in the style of the moody blues days of future passed  instead the album only sold 600 copies though it has been rereleased in a hundred different versions over the years and has probably sold in the hundreds of thousands by now  in addition to the original 13 songs this version includes a couple of early singles with chris stewart on drumsseveral songs are pleasant in a wildly naive way but other than in the wilderness with its musicall i hear is musicguaranteed to please chorus and one day nothing here is good enough to deserve frequent listening  the songs are short and poppy unlike anything else they would do during the gabriel era  much of it is vaguely reminiscent of what the moodys were doing at the time  the lyrics are like the poetry you wrote when you were 16 and cant stand to look at now  on the single silent sun they purposely tried to sound like the bee gees because they knew king liked the bee gees  this is a two and a halfstar album im rounding down1poor  2mediocre  3pretty good  4very good  5phenomenal|0

first off i had bought 2 albums cause i thought i had scratch the 1st onewell i was wrong they both had scratchs on both tracks 3 and 9 i wished i had read the reviews alot closer  which i will from now on i would not had bought it to those who gave it a good reviews i would loved no wished u would name the ablumscds that u had gave a 45 stars aleast it would give others choices on which to buy and not to buysadly i had loved the music but just couldnt bear listening to the scratchs|0
i bought this because my son loves ocean sounds  the entire time he kept crying ocean ocean because even he couldnt hear it because of the loud highpitched bird chirping i plan on giving this to a family member who loves bird calls|0
the dullest sound track ive ever heard filled with not so great selections i thought it would be more like his lewis and clark track that brought you along the journey this just falls flat not the best ken burns|0
when you buy a cd like this the one thing you expect of the artist is to nail the intro to toccata and fugue in d minor bachs great masterwork and the lead piece on the cd  unfortunately the organist plays the intro robotically truncating notes and overextending pauses  he rushes some passages so badly in the intro that one cannot distinguish the melodic line  toccata and fugue in d minor is so musically advanced that it sounds modern even today but you miss that with this recording|0
i know what youre thinking i could use some spare beats and pieces for my next track  and what a price  all i have ot do is plug up my sampler to my cd player and im moneywell you get what you pay for and i want you to take a look at that price one more time  ive gotten sample cds that had about as many tracks as this for at least double the price and for fair reason this one is horrid  the beats are dated and lame for the most part and they sound as if theyve been recorded on a tape player then burned to cd  theres tape hiss or air or something going on with each track  you couldnt sample it if you wanted tonot to mention that some of the stuff is decidedly unroyalty free as far as im concerned there were at least 2 recognizable riffs that would get you put in court in 5 minutes if you used them on a project  what if the ones i didnt recognize were unroyaltyfree as well  ughbad bad purchase all around|0

this is hands down the best album ever  the story the vocals and most importantly the music is wonderful  the price is steep but it is so well worth it  listen to this in track order otherwise you wont get it  thank god for pink floyd|1

the wall by pink floyd is my ever first album by them and i became a fan even though im 21 i really enjoy listening to classic rock and my other favorite band is led zeppelin but thats another story and band  the wall is their second best selling album dark side of the moon first and wish you were here third at the time i was listening to pink floyds wall album more like roger waters album but the final cut is pure waters i began searching both pink floyds history and the wall itself i discovered that this album actually tells a story line and it strongly ties with the wall roger waters a very good song writer indeed but became such an ahole toward the other members tell his story as well as the band themselves roger begins the story with a young boy growing up with out a father and an over protective mother this part is very true since it really deals with rogers past he really did grew up fatherless his dad eric fletcher waters died while serving world war ii then the story goes on how the boywhose name is pink floydbecame a big rock star like the band themselves then of course pinkie our protagonist in the story falls away with drugs this part here deals with a real experience pink floyds original founder and singer syd barrett took lsd in the late sixties and became a much more different man and he was replaced by david gilmour the rogers story becomes really weird he then decides to deliver the point of view in pinkies mind this is where the album focus on what pinkie truly sees in his eyes this part here is where he imagines hes not a singer at all but a nazi like leader since this is very strongly influenced by world war ii because waters dad was killed by the nazis hepinkietries to break out of this wall and thats where the album ends to see the whole story in much more detail watch the movie which im actually glad that roger wrote the screenplaynow that you got the story down and some pink floyds history the wall was first of its kind since it actually deals with a storyline and deals with much more darker mood however some songs are really good to stand by themselves while youre not really thinking about the story at all in the flesh really kicks off the album in high gear this seems to sum up whats coming in the album i wish i could go more detail in every track but im really doing the ones that i love from this album another brick in the wall part 1 deals with roger telling a photograph of his father the happiest days of our lives is an opener for another brick in the wall part 2 these two tracks are about mean school teachers mother is a nice and slower paste track this part is about rogers over protected mother and i like david gilmour singing the two parts in this song as in the point of view of mother herself young lust is david gilmours type of music the song is about pinkie traveling around and getting laid another brick in the wall part 3 is a lot shorter but more heavier than the first two parts i wish the band could have made the song a lot longer because the lyrics are good and the music is a lot more heavier hey you is an eerie track that david gilmour sings first half of the song its about pinkie trying reaching out but not getting help at all comfortably numb is the song that most pink floyd fans love its a dark song with a nice balance of lightness in the chorus this is where pinkie becomes so drug up that he imagines himself as a nazi like leader the show must go on is almost like the pervious song but much more shorter and david sings much more faster i do wish the band could have made this song a lit longer but its still enjoyable run like hell puts the songs on the second disc more in higher gear the song is a lot heavier in music and in lyrics it deals with pinkie thinking hes really the running the show in his own wayi do like the wall but i dont think its perfect like the dark side of the moon one of the problems i have with this album is theres too much roger waters music rather than gilmoursor even wrights now i know there will be some of you will tell me the wall is their best youre not a pink floyd fan if you didnt like the wall i do like the album guys but the point im trying to address is this roger waters is good yes but he was too controlling in this albumand he had total control with the final cut theres time i wish in this album that have richard wrights or david gilmours music style rather than rogers  the thin ice could have been better i wish the beginning and middle were different because i really skip the track when i heard wrights keyboard in the middle im not blaming wright im blaming waters because he had a lot more control pink floyds both music and lyrics at this time however the track does in with gilmours heavy guitar goodbye blue sky and empty spaces are tracks i do like to listen but not as often as the tracks in my second paragraph one of my turns dont leave me now and goodbye cruel world are tracks that are worth listening to but not totally great is there anybody out there nobody home and vera are the same for me on the second discthey could have been a lot better i still have a problem with listening to bring the boys back home and in the flesh bring the boys back home is a pointless track i think its just one of those pink floyd songs i still have a problem to such as quicksilver from more and a couple on ummagumma in the flesh doesnt really live up to in the flesh on the first disc waiting for the worms is good but needs more depth stop is another pointless one the trial wasnt good as i thought it sounds like a weird movie track that supposed to bring humor thats  how i really hear the track sorry for the ones that really really like the song outside the wall has the beginning of in the flesh sound such as the children singing wordlessly im not really into this track as well no matter how much i listen to ityes the wall turned me on to pink floyd but after listening to other pink floyd albumsi dont think this album is totally great good yes but not absolutely great the wall isnt one my favorite pink floyd albums list because i can not really listen all way through the album i wish i could but i cant and yes a momentary lapse of reason is one of my favorites some of you pure roger waters fans had all ready said oh please this guy is nuts david gilmour ruined pink floyd the truth is he didnt he might for you roger water fans but he didnt for me i actually think he helped pink floyd because he didnt let roger gets his way and by the way the final cut wasnt all that good and it was supposed to be their last album think god david gilmour delivered two more albums ad yes animals is one of my favorites as well some of you will ask why since waters was getting in control of the bandi felt that david gave is own style of music in that album not purely waters type of style im not trying to be cocky im a huge pink floyd fan have every album but the wall is one of the pink floyd albums i just can not fully listen too yes there are some very very good tracks on the wall but theres others that needed work as well i just wish the band should have worked together rather than let waters have had his own way because some of his musicwelllet me say interestingand i also like their experience edition for this album some tracks shouldnt have had been cut out|1

so the earth has shifted its magnetic poles every 60 million years give or take a century or two  its been 65 million years since the last one  what will be the signs that another shift is imminent  thats the ground that aj scudiere covers in the scifi novel resonance  its a novel that grabbed my interest early and had me doing the just one more chapter routine for a few daysdavid carter is a geologist who runs by his own rules  he is handed some rock samples that are from a dinosaur dig but they appear to be mismarked based on what he knows about the area  when he finds that they really are correctly marked it means that hes in a localized spot where the northsouth polarity has been reversed  and he thinks he knows where some other hotspots have occurred but ignored as they didnt fit the expected patternsbecky sorenson is a scientist at a biodiversity lab and shes found a location by her home where many of the frogs have six legs  after further study they also have a strange tendency to remain aligned on a magnetic path much like a compass  shes trying to figure out if this is due to some industrial contamination or perhaps something even more disturbingfinally we have two doctors who have just gone to work for the cdc  jordan abellard and jillian brookwood  as a team theyve been sent out to investigate a series of deaths that are localized to one specific adult care home  nothing seems to tie the cases together from a medical standpoint other than they all wind up dead in a very short period of time after the onset of symptoms  when the same type of outbreak starts occurring in other areas abellard and brookwood know they are on the edge of something that could be even more deadly than aids or avian flu  but they arent getting any closer to finding the answers they needscudiere takes these three plotlines and brings the characters together in a way that allows each of their fields of expertise to contribute to solving the puzzle  when it becomes obvious that each of these locations involves a complete reversal in magnetic polarity the action picks up in intensity as the magnetic hotspots are growing at an everincreasing rate  the last 200 pages or so of the story take a completely unexpected twist that took awhile to understand  but in terms of science fiction i thought it worked pretty well  scudiere also does a very nice job with the characters in terms of making them appear to be real people with real emotions  considering the book is nearly 500 pages the pacing maintains itself well and i never felt the urge to shift into scan mode to get past any slow spotsscudiere definitely goes on my would read this author again list  which is good because im currently reading vengeance by the same author right now  |1

the opitomy spelling of how stupid this album is as a whole is the one song paperback writer  the rest of the songs make even less sense except for maybe a few or they sound like rehashings of songs already on this cd hard days night eight days a week and cant buy me love are the kinds of songs even a kareoke singer could have made a living off of if they knew how to write a basic song and they all sound the same  the rest of the songs are just plain too darn easy to overlook cause theyre stupidif i were to give the beatles credit for being good songwriters i would use most of the songs from the companion to this cd  19671970  as examples|0

its hard to explain why i didnt like this cd much of the first movement of the trout sounded to me just like a bunch of notes not going anywhere not really connected much with each other the first movement of the quintet was better but lifeless mechanical to my earim almost embarrassed i dont like this cd i listened to the first movement of each piece and thats all i could take im not an expert but i do listen to a lot of classical music and i do like schubert and mozart many performances of classical music i find quite moving these two didnt move me at all|0
einojuhani rautavaara wrote vigilia his setting of the orthodox vespers and matins service in 1971 and 1972 the a capella work is musically quite varied running from the byzantine style which the church has preserved to modernist features such as clusters and microtonespersonally i find this whole production offensive the tradition of the orthodox church does not permit music as modern as rautavaaras in liturgy im no conservative who likes to trash new music for i listen to boulez and other darmstadt figures daily but for liturgical music there are rules the church also does it permit commissioning liturgical music from one not devout who approaches the task with prayer and the guidence of his spiritual father rautavaara even makes a appallingly antiorthodox statement in his liner notes supporting the heresy of ecumenism this might not bother listeners who just want to listen to the work as they would to any vocal writing but for those who are mindful of the orthodox tradition this is all deeply troublingthose wishing to hear orthodox liturgical music in finnish should seek out the disc liturgia where the ortodoksinen kamarikuoro lead by juhani matsi perform this was recorded at the new valamo monastery and reflects the beauty and truth of the finnish orthodox church|0
i was introduced to pink floyd by this land mark album nearly 8 years ago initially i took it as a piece of scrap cause i was not into this kind of music at that time but then with the passage of time it turned out to be most amazing album for me ever produced in the whole era of rock music i agree with one of my fellow reviewers that its really a journey through madness this is alternative pshychedelic rock at its best more precisely to say it is a collection of moods and you cannot find so much moods and shades of life anywhere else in any music collection it has everything from life to death from aggression of war to the meloncholy of peace from ecstacy of joy to retaliation of violence from tenderness of motherhood to the fear of brutal from frustation of loss to the cure for pain and what else i can say these guys are true genius a perfect combination of life moods into the lyrics and a brilliant conversion and execution of these lyrics into music for those of you who like contemporary alternative rockers must listen to this and you would certainy know that pink floyd rules are astonishingly abstarct and way ahead from these hollow contemporaries awesome lyrics stunning music and a wonderful union of master minds especially david gilmour and roger waters this band is simply the leader in its genre give it a listen you will definitely find out chaos|1

wow this is my second pink floyd album and probably one of my favorite albums of all time this  according to most critics and fans those who thought the bands last two cds suck from lack of roger waters is their last great acheivement i on the other hand dissagree but thats for another review i think this one of floyds best no doubt and probaly their best concept album too but im not as far as to say that pink floyd  roger waters sure he had basically wrote all the lyrics and most of the music for this album heck the story is basically about rogers life but changed into fiction but lets remember that roger is only one member of the band gilmour does an excellent job on the guitar and pulls off some of the bands best solos here wright and mason also do an excellent job on keyssynth and drums respectively antway even though waters is a well crafted muscician he is definitely overated movin on i love the work that the band poured into this album its just amazing there is not one bad track here at all each song goes into the next with ease also this cd along with their previous album animals and the next one after this one the final cut are their darkest albums both lyrical and in mood at least it has somewhat of an happy ending i guess waters is definitely one the best story tellers in music there was also two tracks that didnt make it to the album at the last minute cant remember their names but they are on is anybody out there the wall live disc if you want to check them out this cd along with dark side of the moon contains some of their biggest hits such as another brick in the wall part two comfortably numb and mother just to name a few if you are just getting into floyd or love progressive rock then pick this one up trust me|1
the wall is undoubtedly a masterpiece the sheer musical quality of this album is amazing and after you listen to this album it will definitely change your life the lyrics are alternately brash and painful the music is sometimes haunting and sometimes takes on a more clearly defined pop music edge the album contains several songs which have become anthems of the past three decades including another brick in the wall hey you and comfortably numb the album also stands out for the sheer variety of sound effects used in its making including planes a school choir televisions films synthesised effects and accompaniments to songs the work was probably pink floyds last truly great work before roger waters left this album is definitely worth having and will become a staple of your music collection|1
there are some really terrific reviews here already but i couldnt resist adding my two cents as others have stated the wall is a polarizing album  people tend to love it or hate it im one of the ones who love it when i was introduced to the wall i was going through some pretty rough times psychologically and my misery needed some company i bought the double album and rented the movie from my local video store i watched the movie first i really think that this helped me to be able to grasp the narrativethe music is somewhat dark but not inaccessibly morose anyone who has ever experienced periods of melancholy should be able to tap into these feelings when listening it is not an easy listen though in order to fully appreciate the work it is best to actively listen preferably while blocking out other senses and thoughts ie in a darkened room without distractions i also find that it is impossible to share with others if the colistener is not a fan it is embarrassing to listen to it makes one feel exposed uncomfortably naked if the other participant is a fan however the experience is akin to the parallel play observed in toddlers they are playing alongside each other but they are not truly interactingalthough the music is subordinate to the narrative there are some truly sublime musical moments the song comfortably numb is my favorite song of all time if i can let myself relax it transports me to another realm everytime i listen to it the highpitched ding heard during the chorus focuses my attention and makes me feel as though i am floating on air other standouts are hey you mother and run like hell each is beautiful in its own way hey you is haunting both lyrically and musically mother is both stark and soothing i love the back and forth between waters and gilmour as in comfortably numb run like hell sets strong antifascism lyrics to a killer dance beatif you are psychologicallyinclined you will love the wall listen to it when you have the time alone and in the dark it just might transform you|1
when i first heard the song im so sick  i thought is this avril lavigne  i thought wow she grew up and got mad at someone and decided to be angry i like it then when the song came to an end the radio station said who it was flyleafi hadhave never heard of them i didnt know if it was a person or a band so i went to the store and i picked up the cd that same day and i am so pleased that i did this is a great one this cd came out in 2005 i was just now hearing about themthe music is infectious loud in your face angry and very melodic the lead singer lacey has a great voice which is very commanding and different like i said i first thought it was avril they do sound similar but lacey has a more angry sound and tone and is the real deal when it comes to rock the band as a whole is great tooevery song on here is a standout track there are some loud ones slower ones that showcase her beautiful voice and songs inbetweena band that is well worth checking out|1
i grew up with this recording on vinyl of course the 2 lp box set was still around a few years agoi bought the cd set back in the 90s driven probably by nostalgia as meanwhile the kubelik and giulini readings became my favoritesyesterday i felt i want to hear the serafin reading and his a team again the cd set was still pristine bad idea though the soloists are clear enough to appreciate the elaborate impressive performance the overall sound is muddy the resolution poor and no image well mono this is not what i remember from the lps but perhaps this is not an objective commentmy rating concerns the technical aspect only11032013 typo corrected|0
i cant add much to what has already been written about the wall  its just a spellbinding piece of work  every music fan should own this one  also this is the floyd album in which toni tennille sings background vocals   that in itself makes it totally cool  just buy it|1
i didnt care much for this recording it doesnt sound real to me it sounds like a guy standing next to a running shower stall shaking a large piece of sheetmetal i liked the echoes of nature thunderstorm  much better id still like to find a good recording with more thunder  though|0
they had a chance here hear to make this better than the original cd release but instead of remastering the multitrack tapes they chose to send the original two track master through a modern ad converter and call it good so the bass is a little better but thats about it they could have cleaned up the individual tracks and really made a difference with the beatles but they didntthe mid period albums have shown the greatest improvement from remastering revolver is the stand outoverall id say that the remastering  effort comes up short of expectations  |0
could only listen to the first ll tracks as the rest were messed up  now it is skipping on track six so the whole cd is a waste|0
rushs 2012 album clockwork angels is a remarkable release by the canadian power trio showing that guitarist alex lifeson bassist geddy lee and drummer neil peart still have an epic rock vision and drive even as they are pushing sixty while i dont want to join in calling this the bands greatest album in 30 years as some journalists have this is a pretty consistent and sonically impressive release that ranks highly in my rush listeningfrom a purely musical viewpoint this is great rock music while alex lifeson is never entirely solo his guitar does grab the spotlight at times keeping confident even as the band brings in keyboards again and for the first time string arrangements in headlong flight the complex interplay of these three musicians harkens back to their progressive rock efforts of the seventies neil peart has stated that he considers clockwork angels his greatest achievement both in terms of lyrics and drumming the latter is a believable claim especially as the title track caravan and bu2b  are fantastic showcases of his talents again its hard to believe that someone turning 60 this year can perform so energeticallythe lyrics however are the one great flaw of the album clockwork angels is a sciencefiction concept album of sorts its twelve tracks meant to follow a protagonist through a strange steampunk world where electricity was never invented everything is mechanical and a mysterious dictator called the watchmaker rules every aspect of existence the plotline can be taken about as seriously as a secondrate japanese rpg but luckily it is fleshed out only in the booklet while the songs themselves are abstract enough to stand apart from this storybut while peart may have penned some great stuff in choosing what to sing geddy lee has pared the songs down to a minimum of verses while he repeats the choruses over and over and over again whether its i cant stop thinking big in the opening track the lenses inside of me that paint the world black in the anarchist all that you can do is wish them well in the penultimate track and in the fullness of time  a garden to nuture and protect in the last  just to name a few  i grumble at the repetitiveness of the vocals in spite of the excellent musicalso one might also complain about the sound quality of the cd which is compressed to hell and tilted to the low end however the vinyl release of this album sounds considerably more balanced though not as much as the epic albums of the 1970s if you dont have a setup for vinyl buy the cd to support the band and seek out a vinyl rip|1
i bought this soundtrack for the great raising arizona music that i heard while watching the dvdthe best part is the end credits with banjo etc and a variation on ode to joy  it is not there  only one or two tracks i find enjoyable on the cd for a grand total of about 2 minutes|0
i have been a die hard beatles fan for over 40 years i purchased the remastered mono box set and was so pleased with the great sound improvement even on average to low quality equipment i purchased the stereo abbey road because it was originally mixed in stereo unlike all the other beatles albumsthe mono remastered cds are clearly superior to the old fake stereo but this remastered cd has very little improvement yeah the drums on come together are stronger but it just has no extra oomph like the mono cdsto sum up my feelings on this stereo remaster meh|0
best entertainment ive had in a long time real good clean fun  highly recommend 2 thumbs up|1
i will get this out of the way  there is no tom sawyer or spirit of the radio on this album  no instrumentals and no retro attempts at past glory  its missing some catchy pop hooks and maybe some melody as others have suggested  it is however a brilliant album when looked at like a painting or a piece of art  the journey and story works  the musicianship is amazing the talent shines the maturity polished the message delivered and the story well told and geddys voice is great  my favorite album since moving pictures  and it has some amazing licks and driving hard rock that makes you want to crank your stereo to 11  i find myself bobbing my head up and down and scared to see what my speedometer reads  its got pointed and clever lines and philosophical moments that doesnt get lost or sound cheesy  i just love the album and found their modern mature style worked at all levels  from soft vocal parts to inserted piano and strings to that 3 person intertwined drums guitar bass that we all love about rush  i highly recommend|1
how to relive my childhood  my mind was a flashingmemoring each song that was played the sound was greatand a excellent add on to any colleciton of oldies|1
ive been a rush fan since the 70s i tend to enjoy the 70  80s rush albums  although i admit to not listening to all of the newer ones i bought this to hear if the band has got more of that rocket sauce left well the answer is yes  much better than i expected cool riffs awesome musicianship and songwriting if youre a rush fan youve got to own this|1
i know i am probably wrong about this the numbers after all do not lie 294 fivestar reviews vs mine but i still do not see what all of the fuss is about the beatles wrote some good catchy songs and they were obviously  quite influential in modern music nevertheless after twentysix years of  hearing these jingles they really have not grown on me at all all the  kings horses have failed to explain to me what exactly about the beatles is  that ingenious  it seems that the rest of music here rock n roll had  pretty much lapped the beatles by the time this came around i have an  image of hell as the constant replaying of penny lane over and over and  over again funny thing is hell sounds a bit like commercial radio|0
i have to agree with the overall theme of most of the reviews  this album is pretty dreadful in its musical interpretations  the one thing i can say for it however is that it is actually more faithful to the original stage version the the much betterperformed original cast version  what i mean by this is that it includes all of the music several songs and the overture were not included on the original albumand the scoring matches the small cabaret ensemble more closely than the fully orchestrated versions of the songs on the original cast recording  so it makes an interesting musicological addition to the original cast album  but if i only had one it would definately not be this one|0
not gonna be a wannabe critic herei enjoy this album and i am a strange rush fan who owns all of their albums typically for the last several albums after presto i do not like them initially and they take time to grow on me some take a very long timeclockwork angels is different i liked it pretty much right away of course we had the teaser tracks caravan and bu2b to break us in i had no idea about the concept however i have taken to it quite nicelyparticularly like carnies i lt3 alexs riff headlong flight wish them well and the garden as usual with rush fans i find the messages on this album are easy to apply to my situations and help me deal with my daily grind having recently lost a lot of weight and making like changes for the better this album rocks also we all seem to have a doug  wendy whiner in our lives and all that we can do is wish them wellin this era of mp3 players and crappy earphones this album stands out sonically when listened to with proper audio equipment big nice speakers or quality reference headphones just as with rush 1st album  for best results  listen at maximum volumecheers jp|1

all songs are almost the same no variety of folklore and culture as it should be|0
i am a big fan of klockers playing  i have many of his recordings and ive always really liked his style and sound  this recording however doesnt really make it for methe brahms is technically good but klockers playing sounds bored and entirely uninspired  his interpretation is completely unexpressive  all i can figure is that with pieces as widely studied and performed as the brahms clarinet sonatas some performers just fall into the here we go again style of playing rather than playing the pieces with the excitement and freshness they deserve  this is all i can figure considering that klocker is usually dead on in my opinionthe trio doesnt really appeal to me either  my main complaint is that the last movement is taken too slow in my opinion  additionally the horn player uses a distracting amount of vibrato  i personally do not like when horns play with vibrato although im told this is the convention in europe  if you want a quality recording of this trio look for the perlmantuckwell versionif youre at all familiar with these pieces i wouldnt really recommend this cd  it will probably just annoy you|0
the dvd unfortunately does not play correctly  aacutet first i thought the problem was my dvd player but no the dvd haacutes a defect  it is to dificult to return as i am eighty two years old and the postal service is far away  thia was not a good experience|0
joyce tolbert demonica santiago and shireen crutchfield returned with their sophmore cd in 1992 having listened to this cd two things immediatley spring to mind as one reviewer has mentioned the material at their disposal is very patchyuneven from the splendid just call me i prefer the remix version the excellent since i fell for youwhich is my favorite song on the cdand the mid temporunning from love show when they are given the right material to suit their vocals they shine alas some of the other material as well as being weak also highlights the fact that their vocals werent the strongest that have been heard im coming back loves in loves hand are examples of this any new jack swinger should pick this up for just call me and since i fell for you thanks to  retrostyled crooner through his listmania for bringing this cd to my attention|0
this is a great listening experience  many of the songs on this classic two cd set are amongst the best pink floyd has released  some of them are just okay however the majority make for a five star experience  i suggest making yourself comfortably numb and enjoying one of the more popular rock experiences of all time|1
the cover art sucks you have to turn the cover 45 degrees clockwise to see the picture straight clearly they were not paying attention when they put the album cover together sloppy job on their part|0
ive noticed that most of the reviews on this album are long and meandering so im going to keep mine concise  while momentary lapse of reason is better than most other music that came out in the 1980s it is disappointing to a rock and for that matter pink floyd fan  the lyrics while not bad are not all that good either  the worst part however is the bland and formulaic music  the only track i truly appreciated on this album is signs of life  frankly im going to sell my copy|0
1 great song comfortably numb and 1 okay song another brick in the wall i imagine the rest was written during a stay at an insane asylum too weird too annoying ive been told its great to listen to stoned unfortunately id rather not have to have my senses impaired to enjoy music you want great pink floyd stick with dark side of the moon or wish you were here|0
once again the boys delight and amaze  love this entire album its astonishing  i love love love love rush  hope they play the whole thing in the upcoming tour  i will be front and center in seattle for the show|1
a love joe arroyo music but this cd to me is less then a was surprise this one the only track on this cd smokes is the tune la voz thats about it for this cd|0
i love michael w smiths music but this cd is very poorly produced the sound is not up to the standard of his other music|0
the title to this review pretty much sums up my view of this recording  joanna riding is a wonderful actress but her new england accent like that of most of this british cast with the exception of the american billy michael hayden is overdone  also ridings voice doesnt suite the songs well at all  she seems to be straining a lot of the time poor thing  she sounds more like a mezzosoprano or alto who has been forced into a legit sopranos role  haydens singing is alright but is much better on the 1994 broadway cast recording  as nettie meg johnson is absolutely terrible her voice sounds rough and hoarse rather than warm and inviting  as carrie katrina murphy is acceptable but audra mcdonald absolutely dominates the role with her silvery soprano in the 1994 broadway production  also lacking is a sense of life and vitality that pulses through the 1994 recording  however and we get to hear more dialogue here including the dialogue at the end of the show where billy encourages his daughter to listen to the words of the principal and tells julie he loved her  these nicities arent enough for me to recommend this recording however  purchase the 1994 broadway cast recording instead and hear sally murphy a sweetvoiced legit soprano as julie a luminous audra mcdonald she won a tony award for her work in this production as carrie and shirley verrrett a classicallytrained opera singer as nettie  more worth the investment than this one|0
while the audio quality of the music on this album is outstanding the pressing of these albums leaves a lot to be desired  i got two copies of the record and both had popping and crackling between songs and several songs had distortion in them that was not caused by the studio tape  capitol records needs to examine the pressing process to see what is the cause of these defects and correct the problems|0
an awesome band both christian and nonchristain rock fans should enjoyyes she screams on a couple of the tracks so if your not into screaming its still a good buy personally id grown to like it before purchasingcheck the band out on youtube and their homepage and get hooked  buy a cdrock onw thomas|1
slash is a great guitar player and is getting better as time goes on this is a real good cd singer is ok but he really needes to get a better one other then that it is a good cd to have |1
i so eagerly awaited my cd when i ordered it  and then to hear what i consider an extremely weak cast singing these extraordinary songs  well  certainly the investment seemed completely wasted  but i long now to hear the original offbroadway cast version that i loved so much how could london have come up with four such uninspiring voices for this fabulous work|0
this has become my favorite contemporary rush album  thematically and musically you may not get it at first or second listen but read the liner notes and listen through the album a few times  its taking you on a journey and its a fun ride|1
as brilliant as the original go and live from paris albums remain today too is obviously a poorlyconceived lastditch effort to milk the success of the previous releases  this is dreck plain and simple sickening 70sera discopopfunk with an occassional al dimeola guitar solo or klaus schulze space vibe thrown on top for good measure  not only is stevie winwood sorely missed but so are the rarelyheardfrom dimeola schulze and michael shrieve  avoid this|0
what is up with this album  it sounds like they just threw whatever was lying around the studio onto the vinyl  there is no refinement or any edting on this album  it sounds like they just horsed around with a few songs but never finshed themlike revoultion  this version is slower and sounds like they put the entire tape on instead of cutting it  it is almost like a blooper real  and bungalo billhis name is buffalo billwith stuff like this im glad they broke up  although lennons and harrisons deaths were tragic and a waste|0
lovely lively fiddle music to lift your spirits or sad songs to make you feel like you arent alone in your melancholy  i grew up near this area and though much of the music is new to me somehow it feels like coming homesome of the narration can be a bit jarring and unfortunately they did not put it on a separate song so its hard for me anyway to separate  however the narration enriches the experience of listening to the songs  one disc is songs onlyfrom the back notesits said that the land shapes its people and people shape the landnowhere was this more the case than in missouris ozark country  famous for its breathtaking hills and hollows lush woodlands diverse wildlife and clearflowing streams this wilderness lured the scotsirish settlers more than 150 years agoliving was hard but tough and determined these handy folk carved out a life and character of their ownthis is their story in words and songcontents disc 1 the story in words and song homage to the hills  spirit of the scotsirish  new world  life in the ozarks  hoedown  growing pains  farewell to innocence  land forgives  ghost fiddle  disc 2 the songs traditional gaelic melody for fiddle  irish polkas  hearty boys of ballymore dan collins fathers jig  sweet journeys  mcshimis jigs  cold frosty morning  rye whiskey  road to lisdoonvarnadrowsy maggiejohn naughtons  one hundred pipers  saddle old kate  wolves a howlin  libertysoldiers joymississippi sawyer  lonesome indian  diver boy  john stensons 2  kerfunkinorphan jigs  old rugged crosssweet hour of prayer  spotted ponytomahawk  margarets waltz  shady grove  traditional gaelic melody for mandolin|1

i might consider this material better had i not compared it to the farsuperior louder than hell  every bit seems a halfbaked rehash of louder than hell but with less heart including the jesus bit the gay stuff etc  the relationship stuff here feels extranasty if thats possible  not that louder than hell was a rosy walk in the park but it was much more fresh and original the first time around  plus louder than hell had some awesome nonsex bits like mansonbeatles and world hunger  lets keep hoping that album finally gets released on cd|0
oh raffi sang these songs with my daughter and to my daughter from the moment of conception the memories are so incredible still have the cd and my daughter still loves to listen|1
i could tend to agree that this compilation adheres to the proposition set forth by luigi russolo in 1913  break out of this limited circle of sounds and conquer the infinite variety of noisesounds  yes the artists comprising this collection of compositions adhere to the promice of the liner notes  journeyinto further deviations of uncharted sonic frontiers robert rich and psychophysicist prove their reign over this type of deep ambient soundmusic  coma virus brings forth an open heavy semiorganic palpable field of sound  and tagc white sand is an impressive slow minimal impermanent wave chimera  but his invader on disc 2 sounds like a background soundtack for an elementary scifi show  atom heart presents a drone good for secondary filler music on a full cd not compilation worthy  cti should stick to underground dance music their la genou is a stagnant echo melody  lustmord proves he can follow but cannot lead  disc 1 is a tolerable collection but 2 is unbalanced  this collection as a whole lacks unity and comes across cruely impotent|0
and this is one of their best cds  the music is perfect and the story is interesting so that youll find yourself analyzing it after you listen to the abulm a few times|1

a sad note on which to end an extraordinary careerreviewer eks from hamilton nythe final cut was for me a great disappointmenti agree with those who label it the first of waters solo albums the greatest tragedy of this album is that waters leaves too little space for gilmours gorgeous and transcendant guitar solos the general tone of the album is harsh and even unpleasantno doubt the effect that jolly roger was hoping to acheive but nonetheless no fun to listen tobut my complaint is not merely that this album is not easy listening the final cut lacks the musicality that waters needed to carry his lyrics none of the songs have a recognizable melody certain tracks like the gunners dream have recurring motifs but nothing that could be called a tune of course there are many floyd songs that lack a melody even masterpieces like dogs welcome to the machine time money and us and them but these tracks made up for it with lyrical guitar solos and richly textured keyboard backgrounds by wright both of these key floydian elements are lacking on the final cut the result is an album that may touch the social conscience through its lyrics but whose music does nothing to touch the soulmoreover this album proves that waters lyrics cannot carry themselves often during the final cut waters gets carried away with metaphor  much of his imagery is heavyhanded lacking the simple mystical elegance of his lyrics for animals dark side of the moon wish you were here or meddle  the groups finest albums furthermore waters singing voice on this album is grating and so exposed that often he is blatantly off keyin their most productive and successful years waters carried the group both lyrically and conceptually in the end however his last floyd effort is a failure ive heard this album praised for its rawness of feeling raw it is floyd it is not|0

among the unique features in the late great radio music host  robert j luertsemas show morning pro musica  were his interviews with leading musicians they were long enough so the musicians could really let their hair down during an interview with the celebrated germanswiss violinist annsophie mutter luertsema asked mutter whether she ever had problems with mistakes during performances she replied technical mistakes are unavoidable but musical mistakes are unforgivablemutters point  which i never forgot  is especially telling with georg philipp telemanns compositions telemanns friends js bach and gf handel spent much time in keyboard practice in their youth they became famed for their virtuosity on the harpsichord and organ in contrast young telemann was fascinated by instrumental sonorities he later claimed that he learned to play all of the instruments of his time like bach telemann had one might call a 4th dimensional musical memory or ability to hear music in extraordinary depth but instead of bachs penchant for linear counterpoint telemann went in for orchestral counterpoint his music abounds in unexpected instrumental combinations and effects harmonic and rhythmic shifts  and changes in mood only in the last ten years have i come to realize that whereas bachs robust linear melodies can work even if they are played on a steam calliope this is not so with telemann who according to his biographer petzold was the first composer to paint with soundin short there are incredibly large differences in the impact of telemanns instrumental compositions on listeners depending on performance groups that have the musical sensitivity and inspiration to bring out the special qualities in telemanns music can soar and transport audiences but even skilled players who lack the necessary musical sensitivity can leave telemann sounding like any other baroque music unfortunately i have to put the two volume set of complete violin concertos by telemann elizabeth wallfisch with the lorfeo barockorchester in this category cpo records swr 2006the philharmonia virtuosi of new york formed under the leadership of richard kapp who died in 2005 had some hit records after its first concerts in 1974 particularly notable was the greatest hits of 1720 featuring the moureau rondeau albinoni adagio along with bach and handel works however in this 1994 recording the group seems uncomfortable in its adoption of period performance style with minimum vibrato to cover lack of precision in attacks and insufficient attention to subtle changes in timbres and bowings along with occasional intonation problems the groups performance has a rough sound in other words they have neither the technical polish of groups like the reinhard goebels musica antiqua koumlln nor sensitivity to the musics potentials maybe i have an exaggerated sensitivity after having heard some of these concerti in the recording  by the late iona brown with the orchestra of st martin in the fields although iona browns recording of 4 telemann concerti and a concerto earlier attributed to him used modern instruments her groups sensitivity and precision brought out sophisticated nuances in the telemann violin concerti so that they glowed like fine jewels regrettably though a telemann aficionado i cant recommend this recordingfor 23 years from 1971 to 1994 robert j luertsema maintained his morning pro musica radio show on radio station wgbh boston seven days a week and holidays with only rare exceptions at his peak morning pro musica was syndicated and probably the most widely heard classical music program in the nation|0

in retrospect the pain and suffering exerted into the making of the wall comes through in its sheer weight and sonic thrust conceived as a multimedia experience for the stage as well as the silver screen the wall alludes to waters own personal nightmare  of losing his father in the war becoming a rock star and being worshipped like a fascist demigod the protagonist carries the burden of waters plight and to a lesser degree syd barretts descent into madness and is finally put on trial for building a wall between him and the rest of the world thats the simplest way to describe itat the core is a surly collection of songs waters bears the lions share as he unravels the plot from the very first note in the flesh is an unsettling preamble that forcibly pulls you to the edge of your seat once the mood simmers for a spell in the eloquence of the thin ice the disc becomes almost conciliatory with the disco inferno of another brick in the wall part two as floyds first legitimate single in years another brick baulks in the end by instigating the somewhat subversive lyrics to be sung almost in jest by an impromptu choir of school children comfortably numb its origins stemming from a david gilmour chord progression starkly points out the contrasts that lie between gilmours melodic sense and waters gloomy yet intoxicating words once the trial gets underway  waging waters |1
clockwork angels is massive its thick creative lyrical purposeful and colorful there are no duds on this album and i can spot a rush dud from a mile away having identified at least one on every album since grace under pressure i highly recommend that you listen to it as an album at first whether you link up the mp3s or buy the cd|1

i didnt grow up with the wall it manages to be pretentious boring and irritating all at the same time read other reviews for details i dare you to find one erson who didnt hear this in high school who likes it now 2 stars for run like hell comfortably numb and brick ii get dark side of the moon instead of this|0
i first heard this on a roadtrip and i loved it brian regan has an awesome sense of humor and all of this is so like wow|1
i usually like both argerich and dutoit but emi has not done either of them justice and to me argerich sounds less involved than in other recordings the real drawback though is the sound decca provided dutoit and the montreal symphony with clear open sound that made their recordings enjoyable to me emis sound here is indistinct bordering on muddy at times orchestral detail is lost and on a couple of occasions the piano just disappears behind the orchestra i bought this recording expecting something special but was quite disappointed|0
my husband and i both getting on in years and with no previous experience have been practicing tai chi using this dvd every morning for more than two weeks now master pei is kind and gentle to beginners and goes through everything slowly and methodically my joints feel loosened and my husband with early parkinsons says his balance has improved im addicted to tai chi now it makes me feel healthier in my body and calmer in my mind|1
im not trying to disrespect the music of this movie in any way shape or form  the music classical composed by saintsaens is absolutely beautiful if i may use an understatement  but if you purchase this cd be aware that those who put it together almost succeeded in putting half the film script on there as wellit was very irritating because what i wanted to hear was the music from the film  instead i had to listen to the lines of the film during the music of the film  if that were what i wanted to hear i would simply sit in front of a television and pop the tape into the vcr and watch the movie babe  i can understand if the makers of this soundtrack wanted something in it to appeal to the children  then leave in the mice singing blue moon during the credits  and leave in james cromwells solo rendition of if i had words  but leave it at that  they should have left the rest of the music untaintedwhat im probably going to do now is find the most comprehensive collection of saintsaenss music i can find on compact disc  at least then my listening pleasure will not be interrupted by conversations between babe the pig and ferdinand the duck|0
it was such a dissapointment to get this cd after all the good reviews  the range of this recording is too broad  there are moments when there is barely any sound and then mega loud  i have heard other recordings of  bolero that werent so extreme  ill keep searching|0
i bought this and a few other cds cheaply and liked this one the leastdont know though maybe in a few months i will try to listen to it again and like it better|0
this album has a similar flavor to snakes and arrows if you like how rushs style has evolved then check it out their rock style accompanied by stringed instruments is worth a listen|1
the wall one of pink floyds best known works aside from dark side of the moon and the only rock opera i can think of with a semicoherent plot is definitely worth the price and more i am listening to it right now in fact although few songs stand out from the rest in terms of absolute greatness the work functions as a whole with the songs within sides on the original record flowing into each other with no pause whatsoever any classic rock fan should own this and anyone wishing to get into pink floyd should see this first or second along with dark side of the moon this is an album that will be remembered for years to come|1
as a little boy growing up to become a man i found solace in  those wonderful songs which always consoles me it was as if her songs were specially designed for my emotions though linving in nigeria where french language is not a major language i just couldnt understand her lyrics one thing i found so fascinating about her legendary edith piaf was her voice and style  i guess she and her composers  ever worked head to push those best songs out  thanks for your little explanation of her lyrics otherwise i wouldnt have been able to understand the little i know of her lyrics by now my favorites are les amants d um jour1956 jonny tu n es pas un ange1953 milord1959 non je regrette rien1960 which i leant means i have no regret well this was just song 3 years before her death les amants mervlleux1960 exodus1961 bravo pour le clown1953 la vien rose1949 le prisonnier de la tour1947 and others i hope one of these days i should be able to drop her a rose flower at her grave side what hurts me most is that she died 8 years before i was born  how i wished human were designed to live forever  her songs brought joy to so many peoples hearts sometimes dancing steps and sometimes tears dropping down your cheeks  what a legend she was|0
i just love these cd the voice of john paul ii is so peaceful and very firm at the same time i do not mind is in latin john paul ii voice make me find peace i got 4 more cds to give to my friends|1
well i received my shipment of the beatles remastered white album cd and thoroughly enjoyed cd1  the songs had a lot of new life to them and sound really great  however either my cd2 is defective or i am simply missing something  after inserting the cd in my computer the documentary video starts up and runs fine  the credits video runs fine  but i can never find any songs on the cd even though they are listed on the label  i did a windows explorer check on cd2 and there are no audio files of any type showing up even though the audio files for cd1 show up when i check that cd  what is going on  anyone have any ideas or do i just send the shipment back  by the way this is the second shipment since i sent the first one back for the same reason|0
rush keeps on challenging themselves and keeps growing musically  this is one of their strongest albums  the songs have the common thread and at the same time each have their own distinct flavor  excellent album|1
this review is less about the digitally remastered cd but more of the work itself after having survived a nostalgic trip listening to supertramp i thought i should dig up my boxed set of the wall and listen to it once more yeah yeahits like apple and oranges very differenti have been playing it over and over again just to marvel at the social commentary and the technical excellence of the entire composition i had always told my friends if they wanted to test their hifi set play disc 1 especially the bit where the helicopter comes on and where the sound of trashing runs from left to right absolutely amazingas for the songs what can i say to those who rated it a single star they probably do not understand the music|1
no sorry but i was so very much disappointed with this album that i cannot give it any higher rating the music lacks the power future generation had but i suppose if you like dance music you may enjoy this i hate dance but i loved fg so it tells something of the quality of music on those two the only songs worth listening on around the planet are battle cry and final zone maybe shotgun well dont buy it if you like future generation|0
il disco era perfetto purtroppo perograve ho dovuto pagare 10 di tasse doganali a fronte di una spesa di 30|1
spidermans review amazoncom july 1999 of this terribly disappointing baitandswitch soundtrack is right on the mark only a cultural snob with a tin ear and a pretentious predisposition for anything french could think that this sorry soundtrack could compare with the ephemeral revision by bill conti listen im not even fond of bill conti but his score makes eric serras sound like a bubblegum interpretation of mozart and read the other reviews on amazon more often than not they are hopelessly biased by some mistywatercolormemory of time spent in france as an exchange student or written by some gauche tourist viewing the french through roseacutecolored glasses no doubt they deny the existence of the vichy french believe they are dining in haute style when consuming a croissanwich and havent a clue that larousses cloying syrupy sauces were originally created  to cover up the stench and taste of rotted meats nor would they be aware that currently there is a reactionary naziesque movement underway to ban unacceptable new words in the language thereby depriving the palate and the culture of normal linguistic development not to mention basic freedom of speech that robespierre was a worst fiend than the thousands of people he beheaded and they would conveniently ignore the fact that california wines consistently are rated superior to the overpriced rotgut french varietals foisted upon the american public how nouveau i bought this cd four years ago went home in eager anticipation and was justifiably appalled i returned it the same day for the tonedeaf who didnt find it musically bereft buy an economy pack of qtips and cleanse yours ears thoroughly for the rest of you dont make my mistake write to bill conti and plead to him to release his version which is musically and spiritually superior|0
this items for sell that are listed as reissue is of course actually a cdr version  fwiw  like used is now previously owned|0
just a heads up to anyone considering purchasing this megamix  its not original versions despite the misleading amazon listing  some chick named rachel no last name sings  shes not awful but definitely not convincing as madonna  i gave it two stars as opposed to one because for what it is its a heckuva lot better than some performed by singers out there and the mix is pretty decent|0
trippy cd love it case was broken though cd in good shape the kids love it too  hey teachers leave those kids alone|1
i purchased a cd of the remastered version of the beatles abbey road album  when i received it i placed it in the cd drive of my windows xp computer and got a warning that i had to download quicktime to play the cd  so i did  however when i inserted the cd into my pc the only thing that played was a short dvd video of an interview with the beatles with excerpts of their songs playing in the background  there didnt appear to be anyway to play any of the songs on the cd  i tried again this morning to listen to the cd including downloading supposedly a more recent copy of quicktime but there still was no way offered to listen to the music on the cd  i called apple support at 18006762775 and was told that i would have to pay them additional money in order to listen to their cd  i told them that they were full of crap and that i would return the cd before i payed them to figure out what the problem was with their product  i thought apple products were supposed to be user friendly  based upon my experience thats a lie  apple should be ashamed of their conductso be aware of the problems you might have with this cd if you own a windows pc|0
showboat is my favorite musical of all  time and this recording is very good for the limited number of songs on it however there are at least 3 or 4 songs in the musical that unfortunately are not included on this recording it was a disappointing surprise|0
slash featuring myles kennedy and the conspirators apocalyptic love is a really good rock n roll record  it does a great job of building on the work slash and myles did together on slashs first solo record slash  great guitar licks combined with myles phenomenal vocals fill the ears with a perfect blend of classic rock sound  i truly enjoyed every song on the cd and the fact that the band recorded this cd in live sessions plays through brilliantly on every track  anyone out there who loves rock slash andor myles must pick this up  highly recommended|1
if you have doubts lay them aside pick up this album  if you dont have any doubts then what are you waiting for this album is amazing all the more so for the fact that these guys are no spring chickens anymore  they are not resting on their laurels but pushing ahead  yippee|1
all i ask is a release of the original on cd the same 12 tracks in the same order it was perfection at the time so why mess with it why cant the company simply rerelease the original without bonus tracks especially without replacing original tracks like putting drive my car where ive just seen a face should be and without what goes on where its only love should be i can live with nowhere man being inserted out of nowhere and if i needed someone is a grea song but why ut them in the middle of the old lineup put them at them end the beatles were one of the first bands to make albums that were unified wholes and rubber soul was one of the first albums that began to show this quality please please someone release the cd the way it was meant to be actually never mind my 1965 lp is in great shape  ill rip it save the money scan the artwork and sell it the damn cd|0
i enjoy this trance cd and it is one i enjoy having on during meditation it has great healing vibrations and is one of my favorites to support the energy during craniosacral or reiki sessions you wont be disappointed|1
its amazing to see the raves for the wall from what i am going to assume are a group of pretty serious floyd fans  simply put this album while better perhaps although not certainly than most of the contemporaneous pop product is not up to the floyds usual standards either from a lyrical or a musical perspectiveearly on syd barrett set the bar particularly high with stuff like astronomy domine see a chord chart for this song it uses progressive tonality a technique more normally found in late nineteenthcentury classical music ie carl nielsen or gustav mahler  but floyds first outings w dave gilmour more than fulfilled the early promise of barretts pen  atom heart mother and either of the film soundtracks more and obscured by clouds are strong stronger certainly than the wallfloyd finally struck gold with meddle  the perfect balance was struck between exploratory musical stylings and knifesharp lyrics  the quasisymphonic titan echoes is counterbalanced by the creepy musings on madness of fearless  indeed waters selfobsessed navelgazing is kept in check by gilmour and wrights lush guitars and keyboardsin the final analysis floyds creativity waned through successive efforts a small rebound with the masterful animals until finally reaching its nadir with the final cutwaters recognizing this left the band and declared it artistically dead  the pronouncement was a bit cynical given that waters himself had held the bands head under the water of his own paranoiac vision for its final four albums|0
in the mid nineties the technology existed to make nearly flawless studio recordings  however the technology for cleaning up low quality recordings was far less sophisticatedi would have liked to have heard the raw demo tape as was  and who knows this project might have even succeeded if the rest of the beatles had recorded their additions in a similar lowfi manner to the demo tape they were working withas is it just sounds wrongthe added music sounds not as if its there to accentuate lennons song but to drown it out to smother it  if you listen carefully in the quieter portions of the track its clear as to why they chose to do this the quality of the lennon recording just isnt up to it  it was made on a 70s vintage domestic cassette recorder in a dining room not on studio equipment in a studio  its noisy it suffers from wow and flutter and 20 years in a forgotten drawer cant have done anything to enhance the quality of the recording  it sounds utterly grotty a fact they tried to hide under the rest of the music but thats only exaggerated by the super crisp super clean 24 bit 48 khz super polished overdubbing insteadthey also raised the pitch of the demo tape by as much as 12 according to some reports and that just makes the already grubby recording sound inhuman  it doesnt sound like john lennon at all it sounds like its alvin and the chipmunks imitating himand whilst it may seem pedantic to point this out its not really even part of the beatles canon  it was written a good few years after they split uptheres certainly the seed of a great song in here somewhere and its a shame lennon never completed it but what theyve done with it just doesnt do it any justice at all  the beatles dies 25 years earlier and lennon himself died 15 years prior  this just feels like a clumsy attempt at necromancy that failed to honour the memory of either lennon of the beatles|0
if you like christian music then you must have every single cd this man records  he is simply the best christian recording artist of our time|1
i ordered this soundtrack to use for musical freestyles and there isnt really any music on it that i feel is appropriate for what i wanted  i was not familiar with it before i ordered it|0
this has quickly become one of my favorite rush albums  i liked it at first but after a few listens ive come to love it  it is a great concept album that tells a neat story|1
some people approach this music emotionally and thats fine  i am in the other camp where i listen to it architecturally ie the line the phrasing the implied counterpoint c and let the emotions sink in later  in this sense this recording is not successful  you cannot doubt perlmans technique and tone but his very free take on phrasing and rhythm means the implied counterpoint is distorted and weakened and the musical structure is obscured  perlmans uniformly sweet and rich tone also means he does not distinguish among the independent voices of the implied counterpoint and instead runs them together  the vibrato which he uses throughout also softens the musical phrasing as the articulations cannot be as sharp the performances sounds very much like how the cadenzas of 19th century violin concertos are played which does not happen to jive with my ideas of bach|0
i bought this songbook for my grandson when i visit my daughter she has it playing all the time oliver loves the tunes and the fact his mom sings them with him highly recommended|1
why cant we decide our selves what we wish to buy like most people i only want the bluray 51 or perhaps the concertnot yet another stereo version two surrounds versions etc  and a nice box please split this set up and let us decide ourselves about the disc they wantsome may even still wish to buy them allbut most certainly  we  the customers the target group the fans  dont want to spend that much moneybuying material we do not want wish the br version were herei wonder whom decides thisemi harvest pf group|0
i agree with the previous reviewer theres something wrong with the recording it sounds like an lp with dust on the needle  i thought it might be my player but the sample track online shows the same fuzzinessthis is kind of a well musical tragedy because its hard to find versions done by authentic choirs  ive ordered the one done by winchester cathedral choir and am hoping for the best|0
one of the great pleasures of all classic pink floyd albums is that they all contain an element of humor ummagummma atom heart mother meddle and even dark side and wish you were here share this quality no surprise each is a classic in its own right although im not always so sure aboutwishafter the success of dark side the band seemed to think that they had to get profound and that just made them dreary wish you were here gets away with it its a requiem but animals goes off the deep end and theres no turning back after that its terminal dreariness for pink floyd or so it would seemfyi  the main songs from both wish you were here and animals were first performed on pink floyd 74 dark side tour the tunes raving and drooling and you gotta be crazy became animals both were better than the later versions that appeared on the album|0
i too purchased this cd expecting to enjoy some of the great music i experienced while watching the movie  take my advicedont bother  sound track is what you want musical score is what you get  frankly i didnt  even notice the musical score while watching the movie  if i didnt know  the difference then i do now fool me once|0
i can sympathize with tv producers who wish to make prequels or sequels to mini series but not in betweeners  in this film ralph de bricassart played again by richard chamberlain comes back to visit meggie now played by amanda donohoe while justine and dane are growing up something that never happened in the novel  she also gets a visit from luke who also never resurfaces in the book except in a letter years after she told him off  meggie and ralph are as distant as they were before matlock island in it making the first 19 years later scenes irrelevant even before ralph helps dane tell meggie he wants to enter the priesthood  there is also a place where justine discusses ralph with dane though they dont see him and justine hints that meggie must have fancied him and the like which again ruins the book textsciptwriting from the forementioned 19 years later segment  since the original series is hitting dvd next week and they decided not to include this being the dvd is gonna sell a lot less expensive than the vhs copy you are much better off buying it the dvd of the original that is  if you really wanna know what happened in the time between danes birth on drogheda and the 19 years later segment that comes next in the original then read the book there is more story there none of which is covered by this very brief miniseries  if this in betweener ever hits dvd i will debate all pros and cons before buying it|0
today is 10122012 friday and i listened to clockwork angels yesterday and already i picked out my favorite tunes  snakes and arrows is where i left off and this is just magic music  when you grow up with a band what can i say even cds you dont like that much its still your band  caravan bu2b halo effect 7 cities of gold headlong flight wish them well the garden the rest too but you get the point im glad everyons still alive to make music and ill enjoy them till im deadwhich i hope aint no time soon|1
i am not one of these guys who will go through each song even though i could easily do so not only on this release but on every other one i am a rush fan through  through  there are only 2 songs yes songs not albums that dont make me want to turn them up loud  try to sing like geddy lee i cant not by any stretchthis album is the hardest rocking album rush has released since caress of steel  the most musically complicated one theyve ever done the music is so intricate it makes you wonder how they can play it live  but they do the album tells a story but at the same time the individual songs stand on their own  once one hears them a couple of times they become very memorable the story line  hence the music can seem dark but rush speaks out a lot on social  political issues lately  have definitely leaned this way over the last couple of releases that said the music is easily accessible much more so than with snakes  arrows which i thought was much darker overalli would recommend this release to any serious rush fan  indeed any true fan of hard rock  you will not be disappointed|1
i am a fan of some electronica but bush in nowhere near electronica  i thought maybe this idea could work  i had heard the remix of mouth and loved it  so i went out and bought this album  huge mistake it has nothing i repeat nothing to do with bush except for lyrics  please listen to this disc before you buy it if not you may be sorry i love bush but the only song on this album i honestly liked was mouth  heed my advice|0
when i first bought this i thought it was an average effort at best until i gave it a few more listens after hearing it several times it has totally grown on me  the more i listen the more i like it and parts loveif i had hastily reviewed this after just a couple of listens i would have rated it 25 stars i am damn glad i gave it a chance and now its a solid 45 without questionseriously dont be too quick to pass this by without allowing it grab you if youre a true rush enthusiast youd only be cheating yourself|1
i enjoy doing tai chi to this music it is very rhythmic and flowing it is also a good aid for relaxation or meditation|1
my kids have loved him and we found him one of only a few childrensmusic singers who didnt wear thin on parents ears  the others are fred penner mary rice hopkins and jonathan edwards little handsthe trouble is when raffi decides to go serious and sing these abysmal save the diverse planet stuff his talent evaporates and you can feel the smug didactic fog rolling in  a visit to his website is full of such nonsensewhich gives us a chance to teach a very important lesson to our young kids being a good singer doesnt mean you are a good or wise person any more than being a good plumber or leftfielder does i like the beatles but their behaviors outside the studio left much to be desiredgreat early songs from raffi|1
rush is my favorite group  i have been a fan for over 30 years  though i liked their last two albums and loved vapor trials i do not like clockwork angels  if i would have listened to it before i bought it i would not have bought it  they are still great in concert but i would not recomend this album  i could hardly listen to the whole album and i probably will not listen to it again  i do not know what album those who gave this album 5 stars was listening to|0

brilliant i could not put this book down the characters are believable and complex the science is intriguing and the plot kept me transfixed fasten your seatbelt and hang on for the ride what a treat|1
i tried to like this one i really did but every time i went about listening through revolver i felt more inclined to put in sgt peppers the album does have a few not many strong tracks namely eleanor rigby and the one after that about sleeping harrisons contribution sucks in comparison to within you witout you people go on these reviews blogs etc and say how when im 64 is such an embarrasement but why dont they pop this thing in if they want to hate on something considered a masterpiece the last track is atrocious in comparison to a day in the life and overall not a great album mediocre at best the best beatles albums are sgt peppers lonely hearts club band abbey road a hard days night and help respectively the latter can be taken for what they are and what theyre not trying to be if i wanted to be a helpful reviewer and not a beatles kisssser then i would suggest skipping out on this one it really is more like a 2 12 but doesnt deserve to be rounded up to a three maybe im missing something id love it if someone enlightened me as to why this album is so enlightened my advice go with the albums i listed above most of the rest isnt that good or worth legally purchusing|0
i have been a rush fan since 1975 theyre probably my favorite band their recordings often differ from one another as their tastes and interests change and mine do too so the direction ca took is no surprise at all i love that alex has stepped up his game a little and has added many really nice guitar licks and is showing his chops again the rush chemistry just works as it always has  with peart supplying lyrical content and direction as well as some really ass kicking drumming and lee and lifeson writing the musical content and arrangements what the hell is not to likehow many more albums will they do this is 20 you gotta love whatever they put out just because but  this is really a nice piece of work anyway well done guyssort of amazing that after all these years they still love their craft well i do tooi hear parts of many other rush albums in this one sounds like you would imagine it would sound its classic rush yet new at the same timei like the concept album thing they docant wait to see them twice on this years tourrock on guysany rush fan will love this album|1
rarely do bands who have been around as long as rush have continue to put out albums as significant as this clockwork angels finds rush almost 40 years into their career at an artistic and creative peak never ones for complacency rush have continued to challenge themselves and their fans with every album clockwork angels shows a band still firing on all cylindersthings get off to an energetic start with a pair of tunes released 2 years ago  the almost metallicalike caravan and the hard hitting bu2b brought up to believe both songs are slightly remixed here from their original versions especially bu2b which contains a new intro the tunes are essentially the same but have updated to fit in with the sound of the rest of this concept album things continue to move along with the title track with its timing changes and various influences proves to be a feast for any rush fan the 4th track the anarchist is a highlight with its almost throwback sound of early 80s rush  carnies starts off with one alex lifesons dirtiest riffs ever and propels itself into being one of the many highlights of this album things slow down a bit in a good way with the most ballad like tune since losing it with halo effect but quickly pick up again with seven cities of gold which contains a riff that wouldnt sound out of place with rage against the machine my personal favorite from the album  the wreckers  comes next with one of my favorite rush choruss the proglike headlong flight is an aggressive and tough tune that is proving itself as a live classic on their current tour bu2b2 is a cool little segue into  wish them well probably the most basic tune on the album but what it lacks in complexity it more than makes up for with its catchiness and inspiring lyrics things end on a high note with what is probably one rushs best closing songs  the garden a gorgeous midtempo song that showcases lifesons talent as a soloisti wont go too deep into the concept  i feel it isnt what makes this a great album i will say that the story is pretty cool and after a few listens does become more and more clear but honestly its just icing on the cake for me what makes this such a classic album is the passion and fury rush plays with this truly does sound like a unified piece of work the sound is consistent through out even though this is considered a concept album the songs also have a universal meaning that transcend the story each song stands on its own so it isnt like they sound out of place when listened to individually ive read reviews saying there arent any hooks but i tend to think the opposite i felt their last 2 albums vapor trails and snakes  arrows were very dense and layered and as much as i like those albums the melodies werent as easily recognizable or even apparent here things are a little simple each instrument stands out more and as a result the songs make more of a musical statement so for me i feel as though clockwork angels actually has more hooks not that hooks is what makes a great rush album but for me this has everything i want in a rush album  great playing solid songwriting passion inspiring lyrics and solid production yes solid production again ive read reviews from fans complaining about the sound honestly i think it sounds great maybe even better than their last album and certainly better than vapor trails which was a brickwalled mess  neil pearts playing through is thunderous and inspired alex lifeson who on snakes  arrows has sounded amazing continues to impress and geddy lees bass is more upfront than it has been in many years which maybe be why this feels like an older rush album also lees vocals are solid throughout  much more intense than he has been in the last 20 yearsi realize this may not be what every rush fan wanted especially fans of the 70s or early 80s but for a fan like myself who enjoys all the various stages of rush this album was a real treat over the last 2 months ive tried to complete the sentence this is the best rush album since   and i havent been able to finish it yet i can honestly say ive thoroughly enjoyed almost all of rushs albums including the last 2 but obviously some i enjoy more than others so maybe their best album since counterparts yeah most likely their best since say signals maybe which means this could their best since moving pictures that maybe be a pretty big statement but one that may be true|1
magnificent true to form rush have released a masterwork that ranks with the best of their albums and a concept album to boot you can hear the time care and love that was poured into this work by the band|1
there were a lot of cheaper prices to choose from but thought i would be better off paying more  wrong  the quality of the cd is bad and i didnt want to spend the time or money to send it back  so i just chalked it up to a bad experience|0

a great concept of a disk let down with some truly miserable orchestral playing and some remarkably inept engineeringpeter and the wolf has a very young narrator brandon de wilde who does okay  but i dont find  engaging  swarwosky is inept as an interpreter and there is very little  that is redeeming in the orchestras playing  but compared to the  luxembourg group which usually provides decent performances in the  britten they are superstars  the sound is so incredibly bad for the  saintsaens with a really wretched piano sound little enjoyment is to be  had and the strings sound scrawny toough  i recommend buying  something else|0
this is undoubtedly a classic from pink floyd but its not an easy listening dark side is an easy listening and is easy to digest its just that the wall is so intense for a 1st listener of pf that heshe may be turned off of the wall and pink floyd in general i suggest starting with dark side wish or animals when 1st getting into floyd anyway about the album its a great album and theres a great concept to it you can listen to most of the songs in general without once thinking about the plot may i suggest mother abitw pt2 waiting for the worms the trial run like hell comfortably numb bring the boys back home goodbye blue sky hey you and young lustno particular orderthe only things i dont like about this album is that the keyboard playing from rick doesnt really stand outlike on wish you were here and half of the drumming on the wall for whatever reason isnt done by nicklike the chilling drums on bring the boys back home nonetheless its a great album for pink floyd fans and like i said new pink floyd fans should start out with dark side the album is pretty expensivemy copy was 40 but its totally worth it|1

weakest part first carnies is probably the weakest track on this album its a decent song just not greatmy favorites bu2b a critique of the god industry and how we curse our children with its gospel musically and lyrically hard hitting halo effect a power ballad that i would ordinarily dismiss but the lyrics hit close to home for me i think weve all made the mistake of projecting our romanticnarcissistic fantasies onto another at some point in our lives seven cities of gold guitar work kinda reminds of rage against the machine a good old fashioned rocknroll song the wreckers a lyrically powerful song material is familiar to anyone who has recovered from the shock of grief divorce death terminal diagnosis etc with an acceptance of peace headlong flight another good old fashioned rocknroll songlyrically i think this is rushs most powerful work listen to vapor trails and clockwork angels backtoback and you can see a definite thread of emotional recoverythough im a longtime fan of rush i dont buy their music or attend their concerts for the classic rock legacy act in particular i found this album and vapor trails among their best work ever i sincerely hope they play more of these songs live in the future|1
its so fun to have watched the evolution of this band for twenty plus years  this album continues the trend of harder edgy power rock songs this album is a great combination of power rocking songs that would not be considered radio friendly some songs that are a little catchy and could be radio material and other songs exploring a softer contemplative side of the genre  it is a concept album having a single story joining all of the songs it was fun to watch the band do something like this that hasnt been seen since 2112 headlong flight has quickly become one of my favorite all time rush songs  i love the interplay and synchronization between neil and geddy in this songit is something so few bands aattempt and ever fewer do well being a bass player myself this song proves to be one of the more difficult ones in geddys porfolio to learn and play  the only negatives i can say are1 im not crazy about the productionit is very raw and has a lot of white noise im normally not a fan of compressing a production but for rush a production more along the lines of counterparts would still allow the rocking side of the album come through but preserve a fans ability to hear the intricate musicianship and parts that rush is both individually and collectively know for2 as much as i love headlong flight i dont care for the speaking part in the song  in my opinion it drags the song out and adds a completely unnecessary part that dilutes the sheer rock power of the song  without this part i think this song has the potential to be remembered as one of the greatest progressive rock songs ever  i think this part adds a love it or hate it moment to the song that will dimish the songs overall greatness3 hate the high vocal dubs in wish them well4 along the production lines theres a lot of ambient effects added at the begining and end of songs i could have done away with less of thiswith all this said the album is a great addition to the rush discography  well worth a buy for any rush fan|1

saw this band in st croix and love their music after spending many times on the island i wanted to have a little of the island feel at home and this cd really delivers it cant get enough of listening to it|1
the lovely voices of the mormon tabernacle choir are just not enough to drown out that infernal organ music  where are the rousing brass bands or drum cadences or even banjos  not here  this is just not authentic enough for the civil war buff  buy ken burns cd|0
talents dont come much more unique than that of tom lehrer his recipe of peppy wordplay misleadingly happygolucky music and delightfully scandalous subject matter strikes a singular chord with every true lover of the art of humorous music according to dr demento his listeners consider lehrer second only to weird al yankovicwhats more he still has a bit of an edge which is more than can be said for many practitioners of yesterdays controversy so many performers who once outraged masses  mae west with her acknowledgement that she was a woman lenny bruce with his rudimentary obscenities alice cooper with his campy horror movie theatrics  you hear about today and go thats it that was such a big deal whereas the recreational vivisection of poisoning pigeons in the park and the sm hedonism of the masochism tango are as scandalous as ever literal decades laterso its a shame to have to have to recommend you pass this cd up a compilation of his selfproduced records songs by tom lehrer and more of tom lehrer the material is solid but the execution leaves something to be desired something about the antiseptic studio environment frankly smothers the effect and it falls flat the orchestral versions of pigeons masochism and the hunting song the versions familiar to dr demento listeners have a bit more fire but being in the minority not enough to rescue the cdthe problem is simply that toms talents and material are better suited to the stage in place of this interesting but mostly bland historical curiosity you should get an evening wasted with tom lehrer and tom lehrer revisited the concert albums that would shortly cement his place in musicwith exactly the same materiali was gonna say that im sure tom isnt quite so evil as his subject matter would suggest but well he did give up performing to go into the single most sadistic profession ever to be sanctioned by law that of math professor if this review were a sherlock holmes story tom lehrer would be professor moriartysomething to think about|0
this isnt about the updated version but about the original 1986 album that i heard in 1994  while i liked kenny loggins danger zone and its loud rock guitars and berlins take my breath away which jessica simpson remade in 2004jessica i liked your version but its no contest to berlins original the rest of the album is complete junk it mostly sounds like a madonna album to me some of her fun dance pop  did the people who made this album say okay lets copy some stuff or parts of madonnas true blue album which came out at around the same time in 86and make an album out of it mariettas song sounds so much like madonnas into the groove from 85  it sold all those millions of albums the same year that tom cruises movie was a hit in 86 yet a lot of this stuff isnt that good only kenny loggins berlin and the loverboy power ballad are the best songs the other 7 songs from the original 10song album from 1986 are just lousy even the greene song and cheap trick song sound exactly like kenny loggins danger zone with the charged up rock guitarstoo many similarities  gloria estefan and miami sound machine dont sound good at all here with her songher other songs are far better than this  and kenny loggins playing with the boys copies his 84 hit footloose way too much  but the shoddy rock and the blatant copying of madonnas dance formula are all too obvious on this album  one of the worst soundtrack albums ive ever heard they flew air force jets over this lame music in that movie  even madonna wouldnt have liked this album either|0
my daughter and i love this cd set i listened to raffi when i was a child and i am so happy my daughter seems to enjoy it as much as i did  and still do|1
i always knew this band was going placesi live near where most of are from and am good friends with the drummer james ive seem them live a lot they are a great band live i used to watch them back in the day they played little churches man they came a long wayi am so proud of them there new cd is great try it out definetely one of the best female rock singers out there in my opinion|1
for those of you who are looking this is the first cd of mitch millers christmas singalong that contains all thirteen songs from the original 1958 album  that is what attracted me to this import cd from hallmark recordings not to be in any way confused with the hallmark greeting card company  i also have the columbia release ck 38298 that as far as i know is the only other release of the original album on cd  the columbia recording only has ten of the original 13 songs on it  however be aware that the sound quality on this hallmark release is hideous  i read somewhere that it sounded like needle drops  i can tell you that there is all kinds of noise in this recording making it a brutal experience to listen to it  if it was recorded using a needle drop it came from a terrible piece of vinyl  if you absolutely must have the extra three songs at least treat yourself to the columbia release as well so that you dont have to suffer through this one  click on this link for the much better cdchristmas sing along with mitchthe extra three songs on this cd are the coventry carol away in a manger and o little town of bethlehem  since the great mitch miller has passed away this year it would be nice if someone released a remastered version of this album on cd with all thirteen original songs  for those of you who care about the quality of your recordings that you buy this is not the cd for you  if you are going to burn it to an ipod and listen to it on the runway of your local airport while the jets are taking off and landing it probably wont sound too bad  my advise is to stay away from this one|0
this would have been a great cd if it were only the music there is too much dialog and much of the music is butchered up what happened here i can rentbuy the films if i want dialog this type of cd is back in the 1960s   what a wasterhinoturner  why not do it again right|0
when i first heard the album i found watters singing anoying on the slow  songs such as dont leave me nowveranobody homeseems to me the movie  should have came first in order to put the images with the songsthats how  i started to like the other songs on the albumnow i realize that the album  is a dark story telling machine and it has to lisened to as that or it  wont click in|1
hearing these two symphonies played by a chambersized orchestra conducted by no less a sibelian authority than paavo berglund sounded like an interesting proposition seeing that the sixth is my current personal favorite of the sibelian seven for reasons not entirely quantifiable and that ive yet to hear a recording of the fourth that i didnt find at leastintriguing  the used cd at the time of purchase was also priced very reasonably quite unlike other individual disks in berglunds last recorded cycletextures are crystal clear as the orchestra is not only lean but play with very fine ensemble and intonation  miking puts the listener right on the podium with a very broad yet intimate soundstage all recorded in vaunted 24bit digital  im certain if one puts their mind to it they could delineate every single note emanating from every individual orchestra membernow let me get this out and over with  these must be the most leaden and uninvolving interpretations of these two great symphonies ive ever heard there  sure im hearing things ive not heard before but to what end overall  at least the short interview of berglund in the booklet was interestingfwiw i also have berglunds late 60s recording of the fourth with the finnish radio symphony orchestra symphonies 4  5 but its been a few years since ive heard it maybe its time to dig it out  at best the present cd will hereafter be considered a very very remote alternative|0
i thought i was immune to a certain type of eastern european folk music but sebo knocked me out  they sound like the music of some fantasy culture thats part gypsy part appalacian part arabian with a bit of show tune mixed in  really entertaining and exotic wild and punchy  every cut is different  and when theyre joyous theyre really joyous  and how many jews harp viruosi are out there|1
the instrumentals are great and what you expect from what you hear on the radio etc  unfortunately the album is rife with truly horrible vocals|0
i was completely satisfied i had this tape before and it got lost and so i knew what it was like and was just replacing it  thanks ruth|0
another classic from pink floyd i listened to it in my car three days in a row|1
this is quite possibally pink floyds best in my opinion the music is very well composed the story is greatyes this album dose have a story and the lyrics fit each song well it dose how ever get a 4 out of 5 because of the price 2731 for a 2 disc set with 26 songs all together both discs put together has a running time of about 60 min but overall pink floyds the wall is awsome|1
i havent liked one of their albums so much since the signalsmoving pictures daysa solid peice of work they can be proud of lets hope its not their last|1
the members of rush started out as masters of their craft  that in itself is a distressing realization to anyone who writes or plays an instrument but peart lee and lifeson began at the top and rose from therethis latest album  though is so much more than anything they have produced before  the concept album trilogy that began with 2112 were the songs of defiant and eventually cynical then hopeful youth  clockwork angels is the autobiography of a sensitive intelligent everyman who has reached the maturity to laugh along with life instead of fight it at each step  headlong flight reminiscent of my way sung by frank sinatra takes the whole of life its bad and its good and expresses love for all of it  the garden the most lyrical of rush songs even keeping different strings in mind es candide by telling us that the only thing we can do is tend our own gardensin other words live our own lives in the best way we can for ourselves and for those around usreview by the author ofa draft of moonlight|1
pink floyd was a trippy band they were rooted in hard rock like alice cooper when they played straight music it was mostly heavy rock this album contemplates the emotional wall we build around ourselfs when bad things happen it is one of the most haunting records ever it will move you it may make you laugh cry whatever you will feel some emotion roger waters is so much better at writing then syd b ever was he poured his heart into this album it shows you must own this record this is pure art|1
this ignorant fool known as a kid must be combatted in his pathetic efforts  i urge everyone to rally forth and give this album the praise it deserves  ignorance is a disease and this guy has it  fight the power now|1
i am a huge pink floyd fan and this is my personal favorite album of theirs darkside was my favorite and is still great but when i listen to this album in its entirety i love it i have to say i didnt like this album the first time i heard it because it sounds so much different than previous floyd records there are so many great songs on this album especially on the second disk with comfortably numb the show must go on in the flesh run like hell waiting for the worms stop and the trial all in a row the first disk has some great ones too good bye blue sky another brick in the wall 13 mother there are just so many great songs on this album i cant help but have it be my favorite floyd record with darkside and animals close behind also see the movie any fan of this album must check it out|1
i feel ripped off after buying this cd  somehow it didnt register that there were only 8 cuts on the diska total of about 2526 minutes of music  seems to me that ten bucks is a little steep|0
this review applies to the immersion version looks all versions of the wall are being thrown in together i love this album as you must if youre considering dropping 100ish for an album everybody and his granny has owned since 1979 every song on here final versions anyway are rated aces babillion infinity million stars i expected the movie versions and extra songs to be included its an artistic tragedy that i cant spend any amount of money and own an official release of empty spaces  what shall we do now what shall we do to cope with the fact that we cant buy this song on an album shall we buy a new rerelease of every pink floyd immersion set shall we drive with our ipods plugged into our car systems shall we complain on music blogs through the night shall we yell at roger waters concerts write record execs do tours of pirate music sites keep people as pets train dogs raise rats fill the attic with cash bury treasure store up leisure but never relax at all with our backs to the wall|1
this book is 27 chapters of polar shifting  the author writes very good science fiction the book is easy to comprehendespecially for those of us who may not be science fiction buffs  the great thing about this science fiction book  the author makes no mention of 2012the concept that is so prevalent in books these daysthe main character  well there really is no main characters but there are a bunch of characters that the author focuses on  the book was a little bit reminiscent of say jurassic park like jurassic park this book skips around between characters but the reader gets to know them pretty well  it is a good idea to maybe write the names down so you can keep them separatethe scientists work on numerous projects before the plot really takes hold  the reader will learn background information and gather up hints of what is to come  even with their best efforts the polar shift takes place and what can only be described as unearthly occurs  the author delves into the possibility of a second earth or second dimension  the ending was very good the reader will find it ties up loose ends nicely  this book is recommended to young adultsadultscomplimentary review copy provided this does not affect my opinion in any way|1
this cd isnt bad just not of thunderstorms it is a cd of rainshowers with some thunder the constant rain sounds more like static like when your cable goes out i was disappointed|0
pink floyds the wall is one of there best albums  i read a book about the band a couple years ago and the album the wall was rated the top five best albums the group made if you listen to the radio a lot of songs from the wall they play on the radio the songs on the album are amazing they are very upbeat and great guitar solos my personal favorite song is another brick in wall part 2 the sound effects that they have in the song and the story they are telling is just great i would recommend this cd to all pink floyd fans  if you liked dark side of the moon than you would like listening to the wall|1
theres no need to bash them lacey has an amazing voice and just because you dont prefer their type of deep meaningful lyrics doesnt mean they suck it means you cant comprehend them so leave them aloneand im a guy putting 5 stars on here i read the stupid only the girls gave them 5 starspfftamazing band|1
ive listened to this cd now three times and my excitement and joy that ive felt since the first listen havent been abated  clockwork angels truly is a multilayered conceptual work of art  geddys bass playing is very much in the forefront and his virtuosity shines through without coming across as ostentatious and still blends well with the other instrumentation in the mix  harmonies and vocal layering are the same peppered throughout the tracks to accent various different lyrics  alexs guitar work is as brilliant as ever varying from simple to complex haunting to background acoustic to distorted with wonderful solos throughout  neils drumming and lyrics are as concise and poignant as always and the overall concept of the album is just well cool  im in love with all things steam punk so im biased  the only thing that prevents me from issuing a 5 star rating is that despite the narrative approach of the lyrics there are a few instances where it seems that it is not the character talking to us but neil himself  while there is always a part of the author in the character i think that dedication to the concept would keep the wall between author and reader a little less transparent  for the majority of this cd geddys high notes are flawless but as geddy is getting older he is losing some control of the upper register of his voice  it sucks but it happens  in the seven cities of gold the quality of his singing suffers slightly due to the sustained higher range of the vocals finally for some reason there is no information on any of the tracks  everything is listed as unknown album track 1  its a small point and may be nitpicking but in the digital age it seems like a gross oversight nevertheless these items dont detract from the overall excellence of this wonderful cd  it will be in the player for weeks to come and i cannot wait for the live show|1
to be quite frank i did not think the first one was that good but when i when i watched the 3rd installment of the hellraiser series called hellraiser iii hell on earth i just kept rolling my eyes and sighing the entire movie  there is absolutely no element of horror within this movie whatsoeverin other words it just doesnt cut the mustard as far as a horror movie is concerned  yeah there is a lot of blood and gore just like the first but once again that is not enough to make a good horror movie  this movie is a very weak horror movie and i give it one star and that is being oh so generous my friends  after seeing hellraiser candyman and hellraiser iii i must admit that i am completely unimpressed with the ability of clive barker to produce a good horror moviefrankly hellraiser iii just flat out sucksits not the worst horror movie ive ever seen but it sure is bad  i have not seen hellraiser ii or any of the candyman sequels yet but if it is anything like what ive seen so far from clive barker i better pack my cooler jam full of beer because its going to be another long night of pure and unaldulterated crap for me to watch and another night of unintentionally funny horror movies which is so common from the supposedly horror movies of the 90s and today  why do i waste my time on this garbage|0
surive cancer now  cd showed up in our lives in both my husband and my hour of need a dear neighbor gave it to us as we were out in front of the mail box at the same time she was there a gift of this good neighbor was a god spot for usin the introduction segment of tinas survive cancer now  i found an answer to getting to the source of cancerous growth as she explains her own experience with breast cancer the wisdom of her words made me realize how cancer can take hold and how i can be the participantthe third part hypnotherapy was a visualizing meditation for me with beautiful music that  made me happy i realize i am not the victim and i certainly can give my body healing energy and enjoy the love and peace tina calls to our attention my husband told me the sound of her voice made him feel good listen to her melodious voice blended perfectly with joyful music and feel better whether you have cancer or not this is a god spot|1
this is the worst recording of one of mozarts most moving pieces  while it may be appealing to those who have never heard other versions of the requiem those who love the requiem will find this version uninspiring  the soprano chokes her way through the entire piece and has a shrill vocal quality that ruins the mood  if you want to hear a good version of the requiem pony up the cash and buy a better version|0
mission impossible is a great crowdpleasing movie and the original musical score is an active ingredient in its success the same memorable music and maybe some tunes inspired from the motion picture is what i expected to hear upon purchase boy was i wrongwe have two versions of the theme song included the heavy metal adaptation played with the end credits and a bizarre version entitled mission accomplished which is nowhere to be found in the movie where is the original version the version played with the opening credits the closest thing to the original theme is not on this soundtrack this is unacceptablea few of the other tracks are from the movie but they are either boring claire impossible mission or severely altered from how they appear in the movie trouble i wish studios would start to recognize that people buying these soundtracks expect to hear what they heard in the movie minus the dialogue and sound effects not some remixed version that lacks the same spiritand all of the other songs the inspired tracks from other artists that make up the majority of this cd theyre all junk some people like to point out that dreams by the cranberries actually was in the movie even if you like this song it is not worth the purchase of a whole cd all of the other songs are bizarre boring slowpaced pieces mostly by artists i have never heard of how exactly did a thrilling movie like this inspire these lackadaisical songs theyre more depressing than anything elsethis cd is absolutely bogus avoid it at all costs|0
first the sound production on this album is terrible the musical  performance as well as the vocals are poorsecond and more importantly  than first the 3rd track lamma bada is stolen from an old  arabic piece and is not credited claimed to have been composed by fain  duenas for all i know this whole thing could be a forgery no offense to  anyones opinion this is the most disappointing album ive bought in  years|0
this collection nicely encompasses most of the melodians best tracks  allowing the trio to showcase nicelt their signature harmonies and vocal  stylingsfor all the great tracks it offers like swing and  dine little nut tree and you dont need me  there are several crucial tracks missing from this compilation that would  make it the perfect compilation included in those missing are the great  tracks i caught you sweet sensation and the rasta  based rivers of babylonfor what it is missing what the cd  offers are first rate hits and i agree with the other reviewer it was  carefully put together and the remastering on it was wonderfully done  that alone is good reason to get this cd as a great starting point for this  superb trio|1
this is some off the wall band i never heard of but its marked as graham kendrick false and deceptive advertising|0
the cd does say these historic performances though not of the highest sound quality were deemed worthy of being digitally mastered on compact disk in order to preserve these authentic renditions all true but buy pete seeger we shall overcomethe complete carnegie hall concert insteadi bought the folk music of the world cd because i have  a complete collection of seegers work|0
as much as i wanted to like this disc this recording is a dudatlantalevi and sfsbloomstedt totally outclass this poor project and the sound is pitiful as well im bewildered by the positive reiews and my advice to those posters is to go educate yourselves with some other recordings of these profound works of art|0
not only does his beard rock his music soothes our wild children o we cant help but sing along and wish more childrens music was like this|1
i had the original original soundtrack record album when i was a kid and played it till the vinyl wore out  if you want to hear the music you love and do not want it to be broken up with second rate outtakes cut in with the really beautiful symphonic pieces then do not buy this album  frankly i think its dishonest to call it the original soundtrack  it is not  as far as the extra music they included there was a reason why it never got into the movie  it was not good enough|0
ostensibly from the hot afternoon is a showcase for a couple of postjobimgilberto brazilian song writers and for some new brazilian instrumental and vocal talent  this sounds like an interesting idea for an album  to be sure desmond had a remarkable flair for the bossa nova style  he even recorded an album with jim hall in 1962 called bossa antigua which contains several of desmonds own lovely bossastyle compositions  this despite the ruefully punning title was only two years after getz and byrd recorded the groundbreaking jazz samba which introduced american jazz fans to the new thing and started a craze in jazz and popular music of the timeanyway it must have seemed like a good idea to everyone even as late as 1969 to return for another take on the brazilian jazzsamba style  unfortunately the two featured composersmilton nascimento and edu loboare not remotely in the same league with someone like antonio carlos jobim nor is the rhythm section with the exception of ron carter on bass up to the caliber of jim halls guitar and connie kays drums on bossa antiguabut these problems would not alone be enough to completely sink an album featuring the incomparable paul desmondwhat does succeed in ruining it though is don sebesky  for some reason sebesky was hired to add light orchestral arrangements sweetening it was called to many jazz albums that were produced by creed taylor in the late 70sincluding several other desmondcti releases as well as sessions by other jazz greats  whether the incorporation of these dreadful overdubbed orchestrations was a symptom of blatant commercialization or whether taylor genuinely thought it constituted some kind of revolutionary popjazzclassical fusion i dont pretend to knowbut i do know the results are to say the least unjazzy  sebeskys arrangements are so insipid that they make elevator music seem excitingso pop and goofy that they make newage music seem hot  moreover they are so poorly realized that they even submerge the principal musicians  you have to constantly switch channels just to hear desmond over all the strings flutes french horns clarinet oboe harp and electric piano  can it be that some engineer really thought desmonds alto merited no more prominence that the first violin or the oboethe final result then is a miasma of muzak with the ghost of a jazz giant floating around in itstill there is a reason for a diehard desmond fan like myself to own this rerelease and that is for the extra takes that are laid down without the overdubbed orchestra parts thus giving us a chance to hear desmond in his natural smallgroup settingsad to say however these takes seem uninspired at bestespecially when compared with the same sort of music and the same sort of instrumentation that resulted in the effort captured on bossa antigua  on the hot afternoon tracks desmond sounds like hes spinning his wheels rather than giving out with the remarkable lyrical invention that graces all of his work prior to and after this lamentable sebesky period  on most of these cuts he takes a modal and undirected approach to his improvisations  he seems to be playing almost as if he knew that his voice would be lost in the mixing anywayplaying like an accompanist rather than like the featured soloist  moreover the cuts are all traditional popsong length two and a half to four minutes which is not a format desmond ever used or sounds good on either with the brubeck quartet or with his own groupsdesmond once remarked that he was not the type of musician to dominate a sessionthat his work very much depended on a rapport with his fellow band members  this album seems to prove the point without a seasoned rhythm section good material and room to stretch even the greatest of alto players found himself far too constrained to produce his best work|0
all of my friends who dont own this record will get one from me i will buy every one of them a copy already have gifted one this record is so so so good i cant articulate just what it is about the music that i love so much except that its rush i love rush so its only natural i would like clockwork angels the record goes into every aspect of what i feel makes the band so great the simplicity and complexity are equally balanced with splashes of old school many people dislike them because they selfishly want rush to sound the way they expect rush to sound thats a huge mistake rush will always sound like rush they have never followed the trends of heavy crunchy distortion or super sloppy whammy bar dives or tuning super low tunings or super fast double bass and blast beats its as if people expect rushs next record to sound like deicide well thats never going to happen this album being a concept record doesnt seem like it when you just casually listen but if you sit and read the lyric sheet and the story that goes with it its a neat little story about a journey and the lessons learned|1
this is an absolutely terrible cd  in fact of all the cds ive ever listened to with good expectations i cant count the ones ive heard against my will in friends cars this is the worst compact disc ever  there are not 76 complete songs as the track listing says amazoncoms  track listings get flustered when it comes to medleys but rather nine or  ten medleys to different bandleaders but glenn miller got two comprised  of about six to ten songs each  each medley is godawful they all have  this terrible synthesized heavy poprbrap beat behind them that  sounds like one of those bad rhythms from an expensive keyboard  i  believe also that the music itself is synthesized too  aside from a good  but very short since its in a medley excerpt of charlie barnets  skyliner also marred by that dreadful beat this is gradez  stuff  avoid throwing your money on this piece of trash for if you dont  youll wish you had|0
im not a wordsmith or anybody that can interpret lyrics anywhere close to what others have done here so i just want to throw out a couple of improvisational comments about the music the musicianship  1st like most of us here huge rush fan  2nd ive been a fan of instrumental music all my life  3rd geddy and neil with occasional alex fire the music neurons in my brain like few others here are a few observations from ca 1st rush work in several years that i like right out of the box geddy jams on this album in a way i have not heard since signals and this fact alone moves the album into the lead of recent releases alex got lazy  way too much delay and blistering solos lacking phrasing  where is that tasty and thoughtful work of hemispheres gup and so many others  when i heard caravan in concert i thought that was a filler solo that would get replaced with a real one on the record  sadly not  however the garden solo is tasty and feels like a warm blanket  cant shred on that tune so he was forced to think it through  i repeatedly wish i could listen to this with only bass and drums side note  with all the home studio gear out there now wouldnt it be nice to sell music with a separate track format option so you could make your own mixes i would pay a lot extra to get that capability too much background noise  the steam punk sound effects and multitrack layers might sound good on studio sound systems but to those of us listening on standard gear it just sounds a little overbearing and distracting  all the layering was a complaint i had about the two previous albums  just too much going on especially on guitars i yearn for the clean three piece jams of yesterday ie counterparts some of the catchiest choruses i have heard in a long long while  you werent listening if you dont catch i cant stop thinking big or my favorite chorus seven cities of gold swirling in your head at any given moment totally agree with others that i had my 1st album experience since the early 80s  it was really a treat to sit on the sofa and listen start to finish while following along in the booklet  and the experience ambushed me  i thought i would just sit down to listen to it on my big system  oh whats in the booklet  zing  transported off to album land  nice being an instrumental music fan i was disappointed with the fact that there were none  however when you familiarize yourself with the concept part of the album you realize that an instrumental piece just has no place hereoverall nice work  if this ends up being the final album its one that they and we can be proud of  if they retire musics iq will take a huge hit|1
i purchased this cd with the impression that i could use it to help me with falling asleep  however i wasnt happy with the disc upon using it  it is the sounds of a whale but it is on a roll seemingly over and over again the same sounds  i didnt feel it helped me at all|0
this is a good cd for collectors and fans of chavela who want to pay tribute to this grand star of mexican music the musicians are excellent and the with ana belen and joaquin sabina are accomplished but this and other modern recordings dont reflect what chavelas voice was and sometimes it is painful to listen to some parts of the songs where she sounds so different from what she was it is a pitty that her original voice is hard to find in digital versions|0
i own the original london cast version of the phantom of the opera and ive seen the musical many times and this is only my opinion but i think the singer who sings as the phantom on this cd sings like hes getting choked by someone while he sings and it also does not include the music of the night which is one of the main songs on the musical so i wouldnt call this cd the highlights from the phantom of the opera|0
usually jerrys scores for movies are pricelessie the other score for legendbut rudy is a little bit too unoriginal and the feelings meant to be expressed seem much tooforced for my tasteits ok as a weird sort of comedy albumi supposebut from the  main theme i was laughing because its meant to be such a serious experiencebut isnti think that only the biggest goldsmith efficianado could find joy in this cd|0
not up to his great stuff some good selections but still below expections if you like phil you still may enjoy this onei thought it was less than really good|0
when it comes to classical music recordings i only have 2 absolutesget the notes right and stay on pitch everything else is negotiable sadly this recording has all too frequent occurances of the latter which is a great shame as radu lupus piano work is outstanding perfectly suited for mozart the violinist however simply wasnt up to the task there are very few instruments that shiver the spine when offkey like a violin this collection has those moments in virtually every movement it is one of the very few recordings ive ever heard where its hard to figure why it was ever put on disc or continued after the 1st day of recording for that matter with so many other collections available look elsewhere|0
i am a big fan of rush and have really enjoyed their latest album more then the past few  the songs are well written and strong  i saw them perform them live as well where they really stand up  i must have for all rush fans|1
the wall is among my favourite albums after the dark saide of the moonthis contains two of the greatest songs in comfortably numb  and another brick in the wallthe terrific guitar solo on comfortably numb from gilmour is enough to justify purchasing this albumhighly recommendwarrants a ten star rating|1
this truncated reorchestrated recording of the unsucessful 1954 revival of on your toes did absolutely nothing for me the orchestrations are all wrong and the lyrics to some songs noteably too good for the average man were unnecessarily changed to much weaker ones only elaine stritch singing you took advantage of me not from the original score shines through contrary to what a previous poster said this cds recording of slaughter on tenth avenue is not the longest possible version the remastered 1983 revival recordings slaughter is seventeen minutes in summary if youre a fan of elaine stritch buy this cd otherwise the 1983 recording is preferable|0
as floyd steps up to bat the guys deliver an awesome ballad with metal guitars blaring in the flesh and moves into the next cut with a baby crying which fits perfectly with the first lyric about syd barretts lead singer baby its amazing what this band can produce when giving you a song like another brick in wall part 1 and 2 which is the most catchy tune on the record and will leave you singing it all day one of the reasons why this song has appealed to all audiences because of the repetitive chorus about not needing to go to school its a clever combination of children and an outstanding rock songthen the album takes a left turn leading into a hippie peace song mother this is the most significant transition on the album because it doesnt contain an intro like every other song the album continues with such sound effects such as birds chirping dial tones doors slamming and gun shotsthe most amazing song on the cd is yong lust and not just for its dumbfounding guitar riff and solo but because the guy is singing about needing a dirty woman to have lustful relationships with what guy wouldnt want to blare that on his speakerson another cut the band claims the show must go on in acapella which leads right into the reprise of in the flesh the amazing masterpiece ends with barrett speaking outside the wall as a choir sings in the background what he his saying this album displays instrumentation of using an orchestra and using keyboard like melodies the wall is an oceanic multidimensional song cycle that never ends even after you are done listening the tribalsparse drums adds a lot to the albums veering bass runs but are no match for the walls chunks of guitar and deranged lyrics they toyed with rock using their mighty harmony and interesting and sometimes scary sound effectsthe pioneers of rock and roll delivered a 5 star album and an excellent inspiration to new comers in the industry the wall is by far the best floyd album by one of the top 10 best bands in the world its is a shame that music is not as good as it used to be in the days of pink floyd|1
i know this group and they always produce good quality high fidelity recordingsthis one apparently is a pirate copy so bad the music sounds like it was recorded inside a large coat closet|0
im liking this better than when i first played it a few months ago maybe im focusing less on the story and more just on the music like a lot of storyconcept albums the overall storyconcept is perhaps a little complicated or distracting at first considering that the songs are kind of snapshots of moments  the music is more accessible if one just takes them as songs and doesnt worry about the continuity or the narrative in between |1
comon ladies and gentleman another set of repertoire light years ahead of arraus technique just like the liszt etudes arrau is a real non factor in this music listen to no 4 chopin said presto arrau says allegretto actually he doesnt say it  its just he cant play any faster in order to deal with the blatant and clear technical deficiencies he has to slow down ever 10 bars or so its really frustrating when a clearly technically incompetent pianist somehow receives praise for creatively finding way to circumvent dealing with the technical challenges of a piecejust a sidenote there is one other person who agree with me about arraus playing horowitzunbelievable|0
without rachel ward the whole thorn birds dealio just falls apart  dont waste your time or  on this fraud|0
just good hard rock with all of the intricacies youve come to expect from rush  ive seen these guys twice back in the 80s now looking forward to seeing them again in just a few months  i highly recommend it|1
having junior byles lee perry and the upsetters working together like this is an absolute  dream team  imagine a football team with 3 ronaldos up front and you get an idea of how brilliant this is  quite simply some of the best reggae ever made buy without hesitation|1
this is an inexpensive affordable cd but its recording is old and its sound is not up to the latest standard i have to admit the price reflects the quality|0
this album should really top the album dark side of the moon as far as sales go but it definitely tops that one musically at least to me this is roger waters masterpiece and really shows his complete genius as a lyricist these songs were the soundtrack of the end of my junior high and beginning of my high schools years this is either 1st or 2nd as far as concept albums go and one of the best rock albums ever made ill have to cut this review short for now but i will return to give a longer review|1
like other reviewers here who have given the past masters 2009 remastered album 1 or 2 star reviews i wholeheartedly agree that this release is something you can safely skip and spend your 1218 elsewhere it pains me to give a beatles release 2 stars but understand that the low opinion is based solely on the quality of the remastering which is not quantitatively different from the mastering on the original 1988 release of these discsnote that my opinion expressed here is exclusive to the remastering of the past masters discs the other releases in the collection that ive heard so far white album and revolver have been significantly improved in terms of sonic quality when compared to the initial 1987 releasesthe majority of the cuts from both remastered discs 1 and 2 are virtually indistinguishable from the 1988 release for a point of reference im listening to the 16bit aiff audio files on highend studio reference equipment macapogee rosetta dadynaudio acoustics bm15a monitors in my comparison tests after informal ab testing only a few tracks show any appreciable difference in sound quality and one track  to my ears anyway  actually sounds worse quite simply it is as if the mastering engineers made subtle tweaks to the eq but otherwise left the tracks alone maybe some subtle limiting but no compression or volume optimization im left to conclude that either a the engineers doing the remastering were too timid to or pressured not to mess with the original masters or b the 1988 mastering on the original release was already eqd and volume optimized to the point where there was little to do to improve things i certainly hope the latter is the case but if thats so then why bother with a remastering at allin short when the remastered badge is used to sell a product it should sound significantly better to warrant repurchasing music you already have on this count this 2009 remastered release of past masters falls flat and i for one feel ripped off in case youre wondering no  i wasnt expecting the music to jump out of the speakers just subjectively better in terms of extended harmonic definition high end clarity or low end power unfortunately none of that is to be found here|0
this new cd should rock your face off this man they call slash just dose not seem to put a foot wrongwhat a great band he has put together and the book gives you a good look in side of the recording of this album what i got a kick out of was how they came up with the music for the album and what the songs ment to themto cut along story short just buy it you wont be disappointed|1
the meshing of myles kennedy and slash works great album in every way 5star recommendation myles and slash couldnt sound any better album rocks|1
ive been listening to rush before moving pictures was released this isnt moving pictures but it is a strong recording if you like rush you will like this|1
slashs beefy mean guitars with myless stunning vocals need i say more i have recommended this album to several others|1
pink floyds the wall the legendary groups 11th album stands as the groups most ambitious and interesting album and ranks as probably my third most favorite pf album however many fans are torn with this incredible piece of work you either hate it or love it few fall between thats probably because as floyd standards go its got a lot of short songs and a couple too many filler tracks all of which were mainly created from a burned out roger waters who was fed up with himself the music world and being a rock star but heres the interesting thing the album grows on you with each listen and the standout tracks which stand as some of pink floyds best music ever help smooth out the filler and the album as a whole becomes a very exciting and rewarding listening experience though dominated by waters you still get the whole band playing some of the most amazing music youll ever hear and as usual you get david gilmours legendary guitar playing that you come to respect and love this was probably the first of pink floyds many masterpieces that ive heard and right after i heard it i was astonished it was my new favorite album at the time and i couldnt imagine them putting out anything better then i tried their other albums and couldnt believe my ears they are all good even so the amazing the wall still holds as one of my personal favorites epic masterpieces like another brick in the wall pt 2 mother young lust hey you comfortably numb and run like hell are the standouts but after a few listens it seems like the entire album is a standout very addictive and one of pink floyds most impressive albums and one roger considers his baby having made a movie based on the entire albums concept and following up with its live performance one of the most extensive concert shows in his career whether hated or loved the wall stands as one of pink floyds most recognized albums along with dark side of the moon and wish you were here so you owe it to yourself to atleast give it a shot because if youre one of the fortunate listeners who actually gets it it will easily become one of your favorites and will prove to be one of the most incredible pink floyd listening experiences of all highly recommended|1
there is not enough to be said about this cd it is the soundtrack to not only a movie for the ages but also to the world that surrounds us the songs meld together in such a way you would think the cd has only one song  with different sections all in all it is possibly the best cd set you can  get for your money your senses will twirl and your head may spin but it  will all be worth to hear the wonderful sound that pink floyd|1
not only does this cd keep you alert because every song is unique it also makes you think from the acousting hey you to the wellknown another brick in the wall each song has a lot of meaning you can listen to this cd in two ways you can just enjoy the talent that went into the music or from the extreme pink floyd fans view and recognise the amazing symbolism in these songs|1
i thought i was getting the same music as a cantata i sang it a few years ago but this isnt it and isnt as good|1
at first i dont think i was that into this record but the more i listened as intended to the songs in the order on the album complete from start to finish i understand that this record is a throwback to the concept albums of the 1970s and i appreciate that|1
flyleaf is an amazing band out of texas that everyone needs to give a chance i came across the band about a year ago on a message boardthis is their first album produced by howard benson my chemical romance pod if you liked the ep versions of the songs on this album you will have to get used to the changes but trust me they are superwhile the bands older eps have a more rawlive feeling i think they are trying to break out onto radio with this record and become something hugeif you are still dying for some raw flyleaf their live shows havent changed at all and will be off the hookwhile flyleaf isnt labled a christian band their faith rides all over their music if you are a christian like me some of the songs on this record will get to you i swear i could listen to the album and just cry at times if you pick up this album you will be so blessed by the bands musici really cant describe how much i love this band and want you to give it a listen i am still in shock after hearing it just wow|1
after picking this cd up and actually viewing it you actually get a view of what this band is about  through the high quality dvd performances of red sam cassie and all around me you can see the passion in what flyleaf does  all of the extra features are awesome but the performances stand out as the best perk of buying this album againfor anyone looking for more of a look into what the band is about through performances this is the way to go  its definitely worth the price|1
this is a awesome cassette it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this cassette aretracks1 fat2 eat it3 like a surgeon4 ricky5 addicted to spuds6 living with a hernia7 dare to be stupid8 lasagna9 i lost on jeopardyif you have not listened to this cassette the i recommend you do|1
the only track worth listening to on this crap is the first one which is a decent remix of the main theme the rest is just a horrid mess of convoluted music so bad it can only be called noise avoid like the plague and get the original motion picture soundtrack its much better and get the soundtrack for the even better sequel|0
my family loves rush  we are happy to finally get this addition to our collection  i recommend it to all rush fans since it is the first cd out in quite a while|1
and i think i have pretty good tastes for my age  i remember my cousin singing another brick in the wall pt 2 at our new millenium party and i thought that song was so catchy and hilarious that i just had to go out and buy this albumtruth be told this album is no joke  its the most saddening thing youll ever hear  well tools aenima and nins the downward spiral come rather close but the story of this recording which i regret to have used internet spoilers to figure out will make you cry if an album ever did i guess there is light at the end of the tunnel by the time the album closes  but on the rugged way there our druggedout rockstar just keeps losing his interest in life  all the lyrics are incredibly poetic never corny if you look at them in the right light and practically anyone whos not too superficial can relate to the subject matterthe music itself is incredible too  david gilmour is still my favorite guitarist with the most emotional playing style  roger waters writes most of the music and has a very distinctive paranoid voice  nick mason is an amazing musician as well with an artful style thats quite rare in drummers  then theres richard wright whos usually an astounding keyboardist but was in a phase of writers block at the time so he doesnt contribute muchthis album is largely the result of unrest between the members of the group so many floydians refuse to admit its ingenuity  but it might have been a good thing that roger took over the group  otherwise this album wouldnt be as dark or helplessly emotionalthe wall traces the whole life of the imaginary character thus being a concept album or a rock opera  i love these things because they contribute greatly to the feeling of the music   the whos tommy and queensryches operation mindcrime great examplesthe whole 82 minutes of the wall never ceases to amaze and it continues to define how rock music should be made  i demand that you sacrifice  and set aside an undisturbed block of time and immerse yourself in the music  or you can go on listening to whatever other crap youre into|1
everyone will have different views on the music  personally i think there is some excellent playing here  its a harder rush than you might be use to  a lot of similarities to vapor trails in some ways but i like the guitar riffs here better  unfortunately the excellent music is wasted from the worst mastering ive ever heard  there are no soft passages here as everything was compressed to a narrow volume range  i have revel salon 2s a krell evolution 403 and a denon avpa1hdc1 preamp so dont try to tell me i dont have a good system  i purchased the 24 bit 96 khz high res file and it has a bit less compression but the sound is a joke compared to the old school rush sound from terry brown  i dont think the issue is the digital recording evolution  ive heard a lot of fine digital recordings  the issue is compression  what i cant understand is how rush allowed this to be released  perhaps they have no hearing left after years of loud music and cant tell the difference between good and bad sound anymore  im looking forward to a new mix but cant listen to this  it gives me a headache|0
i used to have this wonderful cd on cassette tape  in fact i bought several copies to give out as christmas gifts in the late 80s  over time i lost my last tape so i finally purchased this again on disc  its a tasteful mix of lesser and well known tunes from early christian plainsong to renaissance to 19th century carols they are performed perfectly by kim robertson with the occasional flute and bells added to a couple of the selections all done discreetly  her playing is pure and heartfelt and the sound of her harp is rich but not cloying  put this on sit by the fire with your loved ones and look at the tree lights  i would be surprised if it doesnt turn out to be one of your favorite recordings|1

i have to say its very reliving to hear a great rock n roll albums these days slashes new album apoclyptic love doesnt disapoint me at all i think its pretty original it may seem a lil bit to raido friendly at times but its still a hard hitting piece of art the only other album shlash was in that topped this was appitie for destruction back in the guns n roses days i wasnt a big fan of the use your illusions albums so in my opion this tops alot of guns n roses work which says alot ive been a huge fan of slashes work outside of guns n roses though like slashes snakepit was amazing and so are his solo efforts overall i would give this album a 9510 it stays strong through the whole album and never gets dull i would recomend it to anyone|1
these guys are stalwarts of the blues scene and put out a good heartfelt group of songs every time out portnoy who backed muddy waters played on this one and life of ease this aint muddy but it aint bad|1

after reading about the new book on the life of this musical genius i was anxious to see if there were any recordings of his work this was the only one i found and i was very disappointed the playing seems to have no life to it and it would appear that he has lost much of his musical ability with the yearssounds like an old tired pianist with very little hint of genius wish he had made earlier recording when he was supposedly at his peak|0
great album  great band  loved it  if you are a rush fan like me i recommend that you get this little gem|1
this cd basically contains the i will follow him album with six bonus tracks among which are the remaining three top100 singles achieved by march  with the bonus singles thrown in it stretches to a greatest hits collectionthese album tracks are in stereo and good not great sound  the bonus tracks however were apparently thrown on from whatever inferior source that may have been laying around the bmg vaults  they are not in stereo and not the quality they should be for a cd reissuethis leads to the fact that these other tracks are available on taragons very best of compilation with its vastly superior sound  if you must have the entire follow album then this is your only choice  if you want a more comprehensive far bettersounding compilation of marchs rca work go for the taragon piece|0
i became a rush fan in 1971 as a drummer myself i can never get enouigh of neil  through the years i have watched rock and roll go the way of the dinosaurs leaving only a few real talents eventually i became a rush freak of the 500 or so songs on my walkman over 50 are rushthis newest album was not as good in my opinion as  earlier ones i have never really been carried away with the whole concept album concept pun intended and this album is no exception sometimes the songs have a strained quality to them as if they are struggling to write a song which fits the concept rather than just letting the rock flowrush still demonstrates tremendous virtuosity and song writing ability but they are slowing down and becoming more technical electronic and mellow i miss the force of their earlier songs the harddriving fullspeedahead rush pun intended of music which grabs you and takes you with itthis is a really good album but i guess were all getting old huh boysupdate i have now had an opportunity to listen to this album several times and i gotta say it really grows on you despite attempts to stick with the concept of the album the songs all stand on their own merit and are unmistakably rush they continue to amaze as both musicians and writers neil is a great lyrics writer if he does sometimes wax deep and philosophical the arrangements are spot on im not crazy about the orchestral arrangements i dont think rush needs them one of the amazing things about them has always been how much music could be generated by only three menthat said i will never fail to buy every new album they produce and i will never cease to love and respect both the band and the music|1
this music is very repetitive and sounding like it should accompany silent moviesnot what i expected  i do not enjoy it and will donate it to the local library|0
i used to work in the box office of a comedy club and i saw lots of great comedians  however this guy was by far the funniest i ever saw come through there  harsh language never bothered me i heard plenty of it while working at the comedy club but it was refreshing to see a comedian who made people laugh because he was funny not because of his use of taboo words  the people who would come to see brian regan ranged from college frat guys to grandparents and hed have them all screaming with laughter with exactly these bits that are on this cd and more  i only hope more cds follow this one to more fully capture the complete library of his stand up routineshe is oldschool having the laughfromthegut hilarity of jerry seinfeld combined with the energy and expression of jim carrey|1
there is only one barry manilowdont waste your time and money on this cd  besides barrys voice what made these songs so unique and successful in the 70s were the original arrangements and orchestrations which of  course these versions dont really measure up to|0
this album was released before i was born but i absolutely love it its 22 years after release and i still find some of these song are playing over and over in my head my favorites are too many times and could he be the messiah|1
i had read some reviews on here proclaiming this to be rushs best album ever  i thought that was high praise indeed and impossible considering the classics of their past  ive since listened to it repeatedly and honestly i love it a little more with each listen  this is brilliant and beautiful and engaging and hypnotic  think of your favorite rock albums that just you just love to listen to over and over  they never get old for you  this is certainly one of those instant masterpiece type of albums and i cant imagine how any rush fan can possibly be disappointed in it  as far as their best album ever i cannot go that high  their best is and always be the incomparable moving pictures  it is an immovable force and deserves recognition as their magnum opus  but i will go so far as to easily put clockwork angels in my top five  id probably place it third behind moving pictures and grace under pressure and ahead of power windows and permanent waves yes i do love 80s rush  this album just flows so nicely as it should being a storytelling concept album and listeners are just carried along by the genius of both the story and the melody  my absolute favorites on here are caravan bu2b and the anarchist  right behind those are headlong flight carnies the title track and wish them well  congratulations to rush for silencing any critics who think this bands time is past  rush is eternal|1

hello  is there anybody out there  the appreciation of this album has nothing to do with any other album by pink floyd or whether or not roger waters was in ascendancy the wall is just simply one of the finest pieces  of work in all of western literature it is not for baby boomers only but  imagine the historical implications of being born in world war 2 and then  touring with a world class rock band in the 60s  70s how did the  one world become the other  how did world war 2 contribute to the world we  live in today  thats what this album is about it is also about one boy  moving from that world as a child into this one as a man and not doing it  very well not well thanks in part to monarchies militarism school  systems drugs and intergenerational differences of perception and by the  way some of the greatest rock and roll ever done is on this album  with  david gilmour a very pivotal presence roger waters said in an interview  that if hitler and albert speer were alive today theyd use rock and roll  as propoganda tools he was right|1
i played his tapes in my preschool classes for many years if you havent heard him he had a good voice writes songs young children love and you dont cringe listening i got this at christmas for a great price i have so many nieces nephews  and the greats that i have trouble keeping an accurate count i have introduced them all to raffi and they now can sing many songs from memory i suggest buying it|1
brian regan is absoluety hysterical  comedy central sometimes runs standup comedy marathons on the weekends  on a couple of occasions ive watched a couple of hours of very average comedians and decided to turn off the tv when brian regan comes on  a halfhour later i was laughing out loud on the verge of tears  i would list dane cook and lewis black in the same categoryif you have a long commute to work or youre heading on a road trip put this cd in the stereo and the time will fly right by|1
like most pink floyd albums the wall demands patience and concentration from the listener to give its full effect this album is very much a roger waters work from start to finish and rightly so because in my opinion its his and pink floyds best work ever if you have never listened to any floyd before and simply jump in on any given track you might wonder what all the fuss is about like previous floyd work the wall uses sound effects such as planes voices babies and bombs as backing this is not an album you can put on as some light backing music but one you have to listen to and if you do you will hopefully see why this is one of the best selling records of all timeat the end of the day its all down to the material the wall not only features some of the best lyrics ever written but also the best music all put together with the effects mentioned before to tell the story of pink from losing his father killed in action in world war 11to being drugged as a rock star to ensure the show must go on waters on the animal tour the title refers to the barriers we all put up to protect ourselfs from others and the descent into madness if taken too far for a perfect visual of all this watch the wall dvd sometimes you cant explain why certain music is good this album however benefits from dave gilmore the guitarist being the perfect foil for waters mad rantings the sheer feel and emotion in his playing gives the songs even more impact and prove that sometimes 1  1  10  all i can say is that in 30 years of listening to some great music from the likes of the beatles the stones van halen the beach boys oasis and newer bands like the libertines and kings of leon etc this is still the best thing i have heard|1

since this album is such an eclectic mix i have a hard time believing that anyone could like all of the songs  most will probably only like a few of them  for me those songs were lazy eye gotham city foolish gameshowever these songs werent the cds real saving grace  what i actually thought was cool was that the batman instrumental theme was on this disc  however after opening with some decent tunes and then hitting these bright spots i felt that the album generally goes downhill  maybe i just dont dig this kind of music but i sure didnt find myself singing along thats for sure|0
heard this cd while getting acupuncturetoo bad it was so expensive but i guess there are no more left as i had to get it from another third party sellerpaid over 20 for it but it is beautiful music|1
avoid this cd unless you enjoy poorly arranged synthesizer music  this is one of those releases that appears to be a greatest hits of sorts until you notice that it is not performed by the original artist  some of those types of releases are at least tolerable this one is terrible  first it is all synthesized  second the arrangements arent even accurate  i know the star wars theme like the back of my hand and this artist manages to mangle it worse than a sixthgrade school band  i actually have a copy that i was going to sell until i listened to it  no one should be subjected to this kind of torture|0
becoming one of the worlds biggest bands had nearly destroyed pink floyd since the floyd a band whom had merrily produced experimental rock all over the musical map since their writer of fairy tale psychedelic pop songs syd barrett had become undependable had become megastars with the release of 1973s dark side of the moon the intrusive attention they received the ever growing business aspect of their careers spite from cult musicians and depending on who you ask either rogers waters ego or the band becoming completely dependent on waters for creative direction saw the friendship between band members dissolve and the loss of fun and enjoyment from making music problems which fueled two excellent but very bitter postdark side albums 1975s wish you were here and 1977s animals so one would perhaps think the bands aching was settling in 1978 when they took some time away from each other allowing david gilmour to release his selfentitled solo debut and richard wright to release his first solo album wet dream both pretty somber records while roger waters took refuge in a serene log cabin recording demos for the next pink floyd album or a possible solo albumbut such was not the case as bitter sorrowful and angry as their past few releases had been nothing could have prepared fans for the wall the album waters was writing locked inside that cabin in the guise of a song cycle about a dejected celebrity rock star who was adored by many but all alone when he really needed someone 1979s the wall was a rage filled autobiographical tour de force that allowed waters to scream like an animal at his country his wife his fans his self and even his old school teachers as the record reaches its second disc which sees gilmour not fading behind waters without a struggle delivering a divine guitar solo through the drug filled haze of comfortably numb the story shifts into the ultimate fascist fantasyparody as the rock star goes off the edge and calls out for more blood and destruction from his fans although at some points the songs get selfindulgent and the story lost the wall still stands as the ultimate fistsintheair dark hard rock fantasy even within the ranks of pink floyds acolytes the album is a cult classic for the more embittered listenerthe album is even a sort of essay on the rock phenomenon as concerts like alamont were becoming tragedies as bands like black sabbath and alice cooper were accused of enflaming young minds with evil as stars like janis joplin jim morrison and even floyds own syd barrett seemed bent on selfdestruction the wall seems to be rock and rolls definitive inward investigationof coarse the wall a double album colossal stage show featuring an actual 50 foot wall and a motion picture would lead to more complex money matters more spite from poorer musicians more egos clashing waters fired keyboard player rick wright halfway through recording and would heighten the attention floyd received to fascination things just got more frustrating for the floyd causing depending on who ask waters to quit the band or gilmour and drummer nick mason to dupe waters into thinking pink floyd was over and then stealing the bands name from him in the mid80s still if you were willing to allow a record to be so completely in your face 1979s the wall is an intense and absorbing listen|1
every song on this album makes you want to learn to play it cant seem to put it down been listening to it over and over|1
in short this album is outstanding  rushtuned ears will be able to hear culminations of earlier works like xanadu permanent waves and 2112 among others in a wonderful rockheavy blend the editing and sound quality too are topnotch the critics are correct when they praise this releasebesides being harder rock than their latecareer mature sound snakes  arrows this album is tuneful and purposeful being a themed if not concept album i for one was ecstatic to hear the moog taurus bass pedals used so liberally as if it were 1978 again and rush the hottest prog rock thing going my favorite songs are seven cities of gold and the anarchist with clockwork angels in third placethis album is anything but a rehash or a release from a band that ought to have quit decades before this is hot was it simply the move to roadrunner records or is it true rush sought more independence by changing labels so they could rock harder it is somehow vintage rush and totally new at the same time few of their albums have come this close in my view to  their musical vision having explored so many tangentsif any rush fans have not heard this yet which id find surprising and they were worried that rush might be running out of steam throw this one in the cd player and turn the volume as loud as you can stand it|1
there was procol harum the inventors of crock rock  pretentiousness for the classical music aspirant without the necessary effortfrom this point those who couldnt compete with such as the beatles in the field of creativity opted instead for being consciously different thereby trumping the merely excessively selfindulgent rockersit wouldnt be long before rock n roll the democratic alternative to whiteonly mor and classist classical music renamed rock by its second generation would splinter and devolve into numerous alternative to rock rock musics each ahistorically claiming to be the true onethere is nothing in the history of rock more retrogressive than crock rock mysteriously labelled instead progressive rock or if one is hip prog rock  anyone for rage rockkill the phony beast before it pollutes the minds of future generations|0
amazing vocals done by lacey mosley the band is just all around great so much emotion put into each and every song|1
he is one of the most amazing and funny comedians i have ever seen  i saw him the first time in irvine ca about 5 years ago and see him ever time he comes back to town  if you love to laugh this is the cd for you and if  you ever get to see him or his showtime specials see it  i guarantee you  will be rolling on the floor after listening to this remeber take  luck|1
track 1 ave satani and track 12 the altar are the highlights of this soundtrack everything else in between is either too mellow or too much out of sync jerry goldsmith finally won a music award for this soundtrack but it must have been based soley on track 1  12 which seem to be the most recognizable tracks that i recall from the actual film the tracks where there is choral voices seems to not blend in there are male and female voices that while performing just dont follow each others pattern and that takes away from the threatening scary atmosphere that the music is trying to relay listening to this cd with headphones is a must although im a tad disapointed with the cd in its entirety im glad that i own it theres also a nice little biography on jerry goldsmith printed on the inside of the cd jacket|0
pacific overtures is the political euphemism used by commodore matthew perry in 1853 when japan was persuaded to open up trade relations because of the display of naval power put on by the united states  the clash of cultures as the floating kingdom was forced to end centuries of enforced isolation is the subject of this unique musical which dramatizes perrys expedition to japan  the original broadway cast of pacific overtures was entirely asian or asianamerican  it is this casting commitment that makes pacific overtures a rare musical to see in performance which is a shame because of not only its presentation of history but because of its imaginative use of kabukiyou might recall the controversy on broadway when jonathan pryce came over from england to play the engineer in the broadway production of miss saigon  pryce had created the role in england but there were complaints about an occidental playing an oriental althought the character was halffrench  so while i was rather surprised to discover this nonasian cast recording of pacific overtures i realized it was understandable not only because the british place less emphasis on such things but also because this is english national opera cast  in opera it is the voice that matters and not appearances which is why you end up with singers the size of offensive linemen who are twice the age of their characterson the one hand i find it very commendable that this show was produced in england since the casting requirements make it difficult if not impossible to perform in most places  but if you want a cd by which to remember the show you should purchase the original broadway cast album and enjoy the original performances especially mako as the reciteri do not want to make this sound like an argument for political correctness because i really do believe it is more a question of preserving the intergirty of the original production which was a wonderful attempt to bring something different to the american musical stage  if had the opportunity to see pacific overture in performance with a nonoriental cast i will certainly do so because i would dearly love to see this show  but i would feel that i had missed out on the true experience|0
just plain funny weve listened to it at least 10 times through over the years and its always hilarious if you think hes ruining comedy then you are disagreeing with marc maron patton oswalt and bill hicks he has an awesome interview on marc marons wtf podcast check that out too and find out why he tends to be a clean comic|1
the files on this album is completely wrong its practically fraud to say its one song and then it turns out to be the completely wrong songs that just put you to sleep the actual carino de mis carinos album is so much better than the songs that were actually sold to me let me know when you fix this screw up so i can have the songs i actually like|0
after countless attentive listening sessions i can conclude that clockwork angels is a masterpieceone that i have been eagerly anticipating for years with the preceding album snakes and arrows rush displayed an increasingly heavy organic more progressive sound each song was permeated with different textures and layers of sound lending to a more consistent album that i would consider one of the best in their expansive catalog this new album furthered this progression and fully cemented their return to greatness forgive the cliche but this is truly the best album theyve released since moving pictures in 1981 the disc comprises over an hour of material representative of a band that is reenergized and revitalized the energy and emotion on here is omnipresent and encompasses the sonic and lyrical quality of every song nearly every song could be considered modern rush classics such as the epic title track clockwork angels the infectious the anarchist and the powerful closer the garden which remains one of my favorite songs rush has ever written the music effectively intertwines with the concept presented throughout the album and the lyrics focus on philosophical and metaphysical themes in a fictitious world that is vivid and broad in scope as always the musicianship present is virtuosic but has been substantially heightened in regards to complexity groove and improvisation this album contains a focus and energetic drive that was holding back the almost flawless snakes and arrows still amazing though and this lends further to the consistent output on this album overall this album is a must have for rush fans and music fans in general buy this masterpiece immediately|1
for some people flyleaf might take a while to get use to but for others they are just perfect the leader singer of this band is a female lacey and she has a distinct and soothing voice she can sing softly loudly screaming or whatever an overall talented band worth a listen|1
i was tempted to do a massive review on this album but why should i just because the album is 26 songs long i will say the wall is gloomy overlong contains a lot of filler and devoid of any spiritual hope but i love it to bits the concept of the album is unique of that theres no doubt and this alone gives it high marks mother young lust hey you comfortably numb and run like hell are some of the best floyd tunes ever written if youre looking to be uplifted  forget it this album is deep and is the most intense work of paranoia ive ever heardbut its great|1
i purchased clockwork angels prior to attending the rush concert in grand rapids michigan i listened to it a few times but completely missed how very good the songs are now after seeing rush in concert and hearing clockwork angles songs live i have been listening to the entire release on my ipod i experimented with the equalizer settings and can now hear the instruments and singing with less of a muffled sound the songs flow well from one to the next and the music rocks the drums are awesome of course and the guitar and bass are impressive too geddy lees voice does sound a little different than it used to but it complements the music and i have grown to truly like it definitely buy clockwork angles after you find the equalizer settings you prefer you are bound to want to listen again and again|1
this cd would not play right out of the box  thank goodness for amazon customer service who asked me to package this dead cd up and then sent a ups guy over to get it  once amazon got word ups had picked it up amazon sent me a working replacement immediately and i got it like two days lateramazond customer service is awesome but the makers of this cd should be ashamed of themselves by not ensuring their products work  this cd was brand new and it would not paly at all on any devicethis is the second time this has happened to me with cds i bought on amazon  the other one was a lorrena mckennett cd  as long as their outstanding customer service continues to roll this way then i will continue to buy cds on amazon  not fearing if they work or not|0
its amazing to me that after 40 years these guys can still come up with something fresh and new like this latest work at first listen i was a little confused not what i was expecting but thats rush they are known for not standing still or resting on their laurels jazz classical and even country musicians have been allowed long careers to develop evolve and innovate and now rush stands among the elder statesmen of rock i cant wait to see what they will come up with next btw as good as this album is its even better live i saw them in st louis on the clockwork tour and words fail me|1
the guy who reviewed  this cd before is talking about something else this is not the legendary krautrock band neuthis is a cd by some andreas dorau and the title of the cd is neu   he sings some 90s disco stuff  pretty cheap cp|0
i listend to the bands single i am so sick and i noticed a great scream then a lovely sound by the vocalist lacey mosley who by the way has a really nice voice but thats it drummings are really weak and so does the bass the guitars are not too good but fairthe music is weak for instance every song probably last less than 3 minutes what kind of band is this every song sounds the same lacey has a great talent which is yet not to its fullest and shes wasting it on a weak written music her voice are lyrics are naturali do not recommend you to buy it yet i do recommend to download it and hear lacey in the song i am sorry which i think she did the best in thats all|0
this greatly underrated album is wonderful trippy jazz what we have is basically a 5piece band comprising chris anderson on piano john gilmore on tenor sax plus bass drums and guitar then in addition we have sun ra tinkling away mostly  in the background adding synthesiser effects that give the music that unmistakeable sun ra flavorround midnight is one of the best versions of the tune i have heard and the 11minute swonderful is well wonderfulnot much detail on the liner notes but it is 65minutes of great music two of the tracks can be downloaded from amazon in mp3 form so if in doubt check it out the quality of the recording is excellent and apart from a little polite applause at the end of each track you would never know its a live recordingvery very enjoyableupdate november 2006the original part of this review was written a few years ago and was one of the first reviews i wrote for amazon this album remains one of my alltime favorites and while it may not be to everyones taste if you do like it then there is nothing like it at moment of writing i just finished listening to round midnight and still have a smile on my face|1
brian regan is super funny and even my 10 year old can listen to him  he comments on everyday things that just make you giggle he is a great comedian highly recommended|1
i always love petra music  however this one is my least favorite album of theirs  the words are excellent but the music didnt excite me like their songs usually do  my children dont listen to it while they have listened to other of their cds so much that they have gotten tired of them  maybe somebody else will feel differently|1
well i know im a little late to this cd 12 years but i looked it up on amazon after hearing the first selection on laugh usa sirius xm last week  i listen to that station for some smiles and giggles when im driving  brian regan came on talking about you too and take luck and i almost had to pull over to the side of the road  i was laughing so hard it really was dangerousso now i have the cd and i listen at home where its much safer for everyone  its just hilarious no two ways about it|1
i also tried to get la paloma on cd for years although i do have good lp copies and have them transferred onto cd but i was still after the genuine article and now it is available  its called long play collection the top ten albums and is available from cduniverse  they are original recordings there are six lps on 3 cds  i hope this helps you|0
sammy hagars been entertaining me since his bad motor scooter days with ronnie montrose here he joins again with friends joe satriani michael anthony and chad smith to produce a very current record as a longtime fan im not about to say i turned it up to earbleeding levels but i could the tunes rock consistently and there arent any flat spots the music created by these veterans shows that they are truly monsters of rock and roll and theyre creative still master craftsmen|1
very disappointed this cd is trash i was expecting great music and what i received was a list of songs that all sound exactly the same|0
the white album at one time was greatbut grow up people it is 2005 this album is a relic not a classic|0
i thought the preachy quality of this dvd was nauseating someone recommended it to me for my children based on her memories of childhood i think if she listened to it today she would find it dated and comical if not pathetic|0
first off it surely could have been worse but having said that its official rush is dead they could not write a memorable tune if their lives depended on it these songs like all the others since at least counterparts are utterly forgettable i can hardly recall or hum along with any of these songs a massive wall of blandness stretched out to six minutes or sowhat was the name of that song i dont know cant remember how does it go i wouldnt even begin to know how to hum it where are the hooks obviously on a permanent fishing vacationthe drums are totally inaudible i put my ear phones on and i can hear light tapping way down in the mix just as a test i put on some rick rubin produced slayer dave lombardo is the neil peart of thrash metaland the drum sound just hits you like a brick coming out of the stereo im not comparing the styles of these two bands but i am comparing the production andor mastering well there is really no comparisonclockwork angels sounds like a third generation dubbed cassette passed down to a friend of a friend of a friendoh and for gods sake tell geddys producers to stop layering vocals over vocals geddy is not brian wilson and these last batches of albums are not pet sounds since vapor trails this vocal layering has gotten way out of controlim editing this review 112012 i just listened to the digital version of the album the drums are much more prominent and upfront in the mix not like the tincan sound on the cd the production is so much better as well and not so muddythe songs arent really that great but this is much better than the cd im still not sure why they would let an inferior product be put out on cd and charge 1200 for it luckily i bought usedupdated 122613 i originally gave this album 2 stars and decried how bad it was ive been listening to it again for about 3 straight days and have concluded that my original review is totally off base i can admit when im wrong and boy was i wrong sure it does not compare to the classics but its a pretty fine record i give it 3 12 to 4 stars|1
for this time i think the amazon reviewer is absolutely right the wall is grandiose in concept and in most of the music but this same concept led to a sometimes scisorsesque execution i mean that there are great killer songs but there is also some filler and meandering that makes the album a little tiresome listening it from beggining to end is quite an experience the killer songs are the first cd until empty spaces is masterful then we have hey you nobody home is there anybody out there confortably numb the greatest of the greatests run like hell waiting for the worms and the unusual the trial apart from these there is not one bad song but they fail to get to the excellence that pink floyd have us used toall these said and making justice the filler songs are a light year or a parsec better than a lot of crap that is out there today and they sometimes flash floyds greatness but only sometimes maybe if it would have been a single album it would be a masterpiece or maybe if all the songs were absolute floyd|1
i bought this tribute album back in the early 90s and listened to it a few times  other reviews complain about unknown bands and that they sound nothing like the originals but i think these observations miss a deeper more transcendant point  i like unconventional interpretations and have never cared whether an artist is popular  but many of the performances sound as if they didnt even bother to learn the songs or develop an interpretation they just bang it out  some performances attempt to duplicate the sound of the original but change up the tempo or vocal delivery eg mitch easters shiny happy people but most retain only passing resemblence to the original structure and lyrics eg most of the rest  this by itself would not be bad if only there was some heart and soul put into the effortone would like to think a tribute to rem would in some ways be a celebrationdeconstructionelaboration of what made the originals so great  and reveal some passion from the artists as to what inspired the tribute  what we have here sounds more like an attempt to leverage rems popularity to sell a few records with slapdash recordings of what sound like might be their songsto be fair i think there are a couple game attempts to do the material justice but to cut to the chase nothing that could possibly justify parting with real money to buy this disc  that may sound uncharitable but dont say i didnt warn you|0
even though i find it to be quite a bummer i agree that the wall is easily one of the most compelling rock albums ever produced  i first heard it when i was 17 and didnt have a clue what it was all about still i was blown away by just the sheer awesome sound of it there was nothing else like it in 1979 and also at that time i was not familiar with pink floyds music so it was completely new to me depressing as it may be it is impossible to rate it any lower it is an all time classic rock album|1
the third entry into the hellraiser series is probably the weakest deadlocked with hellraiser bloodline which followed this film  in this installment we learn of pinheads doug bradley past and origin and after freeing himself from his confines goes on a bloody rampage for no particular reason  terry farrell star trek deep space nine plays a reporter who is all that stands in the path of the carnage and by the time it reaches its conclusion youll be amazed how formulaic this movie is  what made the original movie and its first sequel so good were their unslasher like conventions  pinhead was actually more menacing the less you saw him where as in hellraiser 3 he becomes more like freddy kruger in the later nightmare on elm street movies a less menacing figure and a more menacing voice  the cenobite makeup is great and the gore effects are nice as well but the story that made the first two films worth watching gets lost in the haze here  look for metal greats armored saint performing in the film|0
my first exposure to mighty joe young was beyond pleasant there is a scene in the early james caan film thief where he meets a girl for a date in a bar mighty joe young is live on stage pounding out the song turning point caan walks in the drums start its a heavy rockblues riffdrum line that you would immediately bop your head to almost unconsciously the song is really that captivatingregrettably the song is redone on this album and quite frankly it is terrible who ever produced this or mixed it should be fired the sound on the album is so synthetic it hurts the background singers are absolutely attrocious and it pains me to listen to iti just cant recommend this album buy mighty joe live as i think he is in his ellement and the difference from the live version of this song and the one i found here is night and dayi love ya joe just not on this album|0
pink floyd was already on top of the world when they released this album which in a way is the most audacious record they ever recorded  this album has more of a unified concept than anything else in the pink floyd discography  a rock opera much like the whos tommy and genesis the lamb lies down on broadway this album tells the story of a troubled rock star who becomes emotionally detached and downright sadistic  the album works much like a film the protagonist named pink goes through a tragic story of metal decline and eventually redemption  he slowly builds a wall around himself completely shutting himself from the world outside his mindmuch of the story is based on roger water own life  like pink he lost a father during the war and also like pink he became a emotionally disturbed rock star  the main characters story is also much like that of former member syd barrett who left the band after metal illness and drug abuse caught up to him  the album take on a very depressing tone as the protagonists life spirals out of control  every horrific event in his life such as the death of his father the abuse of school teachers and his divorce install another brick in the wall  the concept is unlike anything ever thought of in rock music  you dont even see this kind of story much in film with the exception of a few like a clock work orange and taxi driver both of which have plots similar to the wallthis plot however would not work well if the music wasnt anything exceptional  yet the music is some of the best pink floyd has ever recorded  aside from the usual eerie soundscapes their is a lot of dialog that moves the story along  and then theres david gilmours guitar work  his solos on hey you and especially comfortably numb have become classic rock standards  and of course theres the famous childrens chorus on the second part of another brick in the wall which helped elevate that song to legendary statusthis is about as mature as classic rock can get  it has a message and it goes to the extreme to convey that message to its listeners  the message that redemption can come even for the most destructive of souls is an age old rhetoric that is creatively presented here is an effortless fashion  a must have for those who like to think when they listen to rock|1
this cd sucks  the constant paddling of the water is annoying  i was expecting a soft tranquail and soothing sound but instead got a the sound of some guy trying to paddle out of his bath tub|0
ever had one of those songs speak to you and you cant get it out of your head found it on this cd and made the purchase in time for christmas wonderful service and the product was exactly what id heard not to mention the rest of the songs on this cd are great for christmas|1
i am an admitted die hard rush fan going back to the first time i saw them live in 1976  and as a die hard rush fan i tend to be especially hard on judging any new material they conjure up  clockwork angels was no exception and the first time i heard it i thought what  ive listened to the whole thing 10 times now and i think it is their best album since 2112  since for me 2112 defines rush so nothing they ever do will take its place  but clockwork angels is a masterpiece  every song has a riff that will stay in my head for hours  pearts percussion is on fire  this is hard rock at its finest  after 44 years together they are still at the top of their game  i cant wait to see the concert|1
the wall is the floyds greatest work definitely i am known as kefka  floyd on the internet because of my obsession with pink floyd if you have  seen the movie you will really understand what the wall is about the main  character aptly named pink floyd is driven to insanity behind his  wall a protective barrier that keeps him isolated from the  real world this wall is built of bricks of his past such as  his fathers death in wwii his overprotective mother the forced  conformity of his education and his older life of sex drugs and  rocknroll the album itself is very vague but if you watch the film it  all comes out in plain daylight pinks younger life is loosely based on  roger waters and his adult life on syd barrett i highly recommend this  album to any serious music listener some songs may confuse you but it is  a great investment|1
we love raffi i have a dayhome and one day two of my little girls started singing mr sun i asked the girls if they knew the song and we proceeded to sing it raffi singable songs was one of the tapes i used to sing with my three sons when they were small 30 yrs ago i went to the computer and ordered the 3disc set and we are enjoying it so much one of our favorite songs when we eat lunch is mr sun i was so glad to see that raffis music was still available we also have his christmas disc and our favorite song is must be santa evelyn in alberta canada|1
out of all the pink floyd albums ever madethis has to be by far the best concept albums doneit really does tell the story of a mans insanity if you follow the recordingto me this is the best work they ever did as a  banddark side of the moon has to be second best|1
read before purchasingthis album is not the original soundtrack even though the cover art is the same the songs are the same but they are not sung by the artists featured in the movie you wont hear olivia newton john john travolta frank valli etc if you dont care about that go ahead but i purchased this album to replace my original vinyl and when i went to listen expecting the songs and was extremely disappointed again if you want to buy it make sure you know what youre getting the actually sound quality is good im giving one start because of the misleading cover art that made me think i was getting something other than what i got|0
how they continiue to do it avoids methey sound vibrant youthfull energized inspired the quality of their lives certainly reflects in the quality of this album and its so exciting to hear from the guys again as you know its a conceptual album and reveals a long story thats well documented in reviews on here so i wont touch on that but will touch on the mix of the album is fantastic they have really never sounded better the arrangements are of some of the finest they have ever constructedand it is to be treasured and appriciated greatly you never know if this is the last you will hear from them as rush going forward at this point 5 stars  simply brilliant|1
the wall is not only the best pink floyd album in my opinion but it spoke to me a lot of those songs are exactly how i feel right now in my life sometimes i feel like roger is singing to me crazy i know but its how it makes me feel i am not going to sit here and say this and this is a good song because you have to experience this monster as a whole and if possible before watchng the movie because although the film is excellent it spoils your imagination when listening to the album get your own vision of the music first and then perhaps watch the film i recommend it too and dont listen to those people who say dark side of the moon is the best album they overlooked a colossal masterpiece|1
when this album was recorded and released pink floyd were on top of the world having achieved all the success they wanted to achieve  but sometimes success has a price tag  the price tag is the wall which sometimes separates yourself from the rest of society  american society in particular worships success and material gain at the cost of ones physical and mental health  it also creates a kind of competition and even hostility between you and the rest of the world  thats what dark side of the moon looked at  the wall gets more specific and tells the story of the pressures of being a rock n roll star  most if not all rock musicians strive for fortune and fame and hanging out with all the groupies  but sometimes that lifestyle leaves you with all your personal demons and those demons can drive you insane  those demons may be your own responsibility or those created by family or business issues  the album begins with in the flesh and the character portrayed is a famous rock n roll musician getting ready to go on stage  but he is suddenly confronted by all his demons such as his father getting sent off to a foreign land to go to war  this segues into the thin ice  his wife comforts his newborn son telling the baby that his grandfather will be ok  the first brick in the wall is the separation he feels as his father is being sent off to war  the next brick is that of abuse at school by both classmates and teacher when he was a young boy  this type of treatment leads him ultimately to rebel against the educational system  he asks in mother if he should cut himself off from all the people supposedly responsible for his tribulations  mother should i build the wall  in other words he is asking if he should ever associate with these people again  in goodbye blue sky the horrifying pictures of his father fighting and getting killed in the war are brought to his attention again  he then looks for something to fill in the empty spaces  he tries having sex with all the groupies in young lust in order to numb his pain  he avoids all communication with the groupie back at the hotel by watching war movies on television in one of my turns  finally all the violence he sees on the television brings back to memory the death of his own father and he goes insane and starts tearing up the room  he is so beside himself that he hurls the television out of his hotel room window onto the street below  he feels remorseful of his behavior and pleads with his mate dont leave me now  finally everything that drove him to his current state of mind comes back to haunt him  this is the third brick  he is so angry and upset that he avoids all physical contact with people in goodbye cruel world  this closes the first half  the second half opens with him working hard to overcome his demons in hey you  he asks is there anybody out there who can help him  he returns to watching television and tries calling his wife on the phone in nobody home  no one responds  he asks if there is anybody out there who can feel the pain he is feeling  he remembers somebody named vera lynn  he cries out against the apparent injustice of war and demands to bring the boys back home  he then turns to drugs in comfortably numb  he is given an anesthetic by the doctor to calm him down  he arrives at the show and is ready to perform no matter how severe his hardships  at the show he weeds out the people he dislikes the most from the audience  he becomes kind of a dictator to his audience  the people who are in his favor give him a hail hitler kind of salute  after the show he takes to the streets to weed out the weaklings the queens the coons the reds and the jews of the city  these people to him are nothing but worms in his sight and must be wiped off the face of the earth  finally he is tried in a court of law for all the atrocities he has committed  he  tells the judge that insanity was the reason for his crimes  he is then sentenced to be exposed before his peers  the crowd in the courtroom then chants to tear down the wall meaning they are glad he is getting his just deserts the wall is finally torn down and the city tries to rebuild itself  this album applies not only to rock stars but also to anybody at the top of their profession who feels constant pressure to succeed and wants to lash out at the world in the midst of this stiff competition  such people may turn to drugs sex or crime for their escape  such themes is what makes the wall such a powerful masterpiece|1
i somehow stumbled onto this cd on amazons russian music search something about the cover of this cd seemed vaguely familiar i started reading the reviews and realized that i had reviewed this one a couple of years earlier i gave it 1 star i noticed that there were 2 new reviews since i last reviewed so i thought id listen to a couple of tracks to see if i had been too harsh the first time around ok i still give it only 1 star frankly my grandfather would be rolling in his grave if he knew i had spent good money on this particular cd but i do see the humor in playing this cd at a party listening to the little clip rendition of song of the volga boatmen had me doubled over with laughter tears streaming down my faceit was hysterical honestly if i were 20 years younger i would have a blast playing this one at parties but ridoughery is right dont take this cd literally i must add that i think if stalin were around today this would be his favorite cd hands down|0
the interesting premise and cool looking book cover are the only things this book has going for it it gets incredibly detailed about things that dont matter repeatedly the ending was just silly the wrap up was poorly done|0
i am a 30year rush fan and i must say this album is very impressive very rushsounding yet has a modernday vibe the band has done a very nice job with this collection of songs in my opinion long live rushone of rocks greats|1
i give it 5 stars for the thumb piano the guitar the vocals and the melodies  this music is beautiful soothing and relaxing  however behind the calm the rhythms and patterns created by the instruments are complex and almost hypnoticthis is not rock music rather i would call it a mix of sophisticated pop and traditional eastern african music  this album may be a bit too pure moody for some people however i dont particularily like new age music but i like this i feel the intricacy of the music rescues it and keeps it from being too bland  as well the lyrics are hardly the stuff of easylistening music dealing as they do with the assassination of the composers father and oryemas exile from his homelandof course the meaning of the songs is obscured from most of us in the west  only one song is in english the others are sung in swahili or acoli  the liner notes provide a summary in english of each songs meaningthis is a beautiful cd  from experience playing it at work most people like it on first hearing and due to its complexity the music will continue to grow on you|1
aside from a couple of songs this disc is very forgettableit hasnt aged well at allthe movie is betterhearing john travolta sing is a bad joke|0

the wall was the very first floyd album i ever listened to and i have always loved it even though the band has better albums  heres a rundown on the story rock star begins to go crazy while thinking about his life enough saiddisc 1in the flesh a cool floyd rocker with superb lyricsthe thin ice this song is a very weird one i always see images in my head when i hear itanother brick in the wall part i the wall is coming up and so is the song quality one of their best with great lyricsthe happiest days of our lives this sounds like the stories my parents used to tell me about their childhood it only furthers the storyanother brick in the wall part ii one of the floyds alltime best hard rockers it also has some of my favorite floyd lyrics i remember playing the song in my math class on a computer and my teacher walked in and said whats thatmother a great acoustic piece definitely a strong set of lyrics with great musicgoodbye blue sky guitar and lyrics only what else just another furthering of the storyempty spaces eerie and trippy but it still furthers the storyyoung lust possibly the one floyd song that had to do with love great tune and lyricsone of my turns reminds me of the late keith moon and his hotel destruction great lyrics with a teeter on the edge of psychotic behaviordont leave me now this works well as a help to the story and a song you can feel what pink feels in the songanother brick in the wall part iii it just helps the storygoodbye cruel world this also helps the storydisc 2hey you one of waters alltime best songs and one of my favoritesis there anybody out there this is one of the eerie bits of the album and it shows pinks state of psychosisnobody home a very personal song with great lyricsvera the worst song on the cd it has absolutely no point with the narrativebring the boys back home a story helper nothing morecomfortably numb at last we have found the best song this is one of the best watersgilmour songs with great lyrics and musicthe show must go on another story helperin the flesh listen to it for the lyrics waters has a great mindrun like hell a cool song with great guitar workwaiting for the worms i dont know if this is a song or an attack on nazi politicsstop not even a song just a waters poemthe trial a great set piece for the album almost like gilbert and sullivanoutside the wall the album is brought to a strange closethe wall is a great album with great tunes but there are not enough great tunes to make up for the abundance of short pieces but the engineering and mixing is some of the best to be heard buy it|1
a former massive attack collaborator nicolette presents a somewhat interesting yet flawed record that combines triphop breakbeat funk soul techno and electronica it truly is an edgy and innovative album still it doesnt quite suceed at providing a cohesive and very solid final result it has some intriguing moments and soundscapes mostly those produced by atari teenage riots alec empire who creates a couple of dark and hypnotic gems here still overall it only makes for a different enough yet average listen its not easy on the ears at times and a share of songs are really impenetrable well at lest it tries to present something new even if it is mildly disappointing overallworth a listen even if its an uneven record|0
brain regan is quite simply the funniest man alive today  the first time i heard his routine i laughed so hard that i threw up  im not joking he is that funny  whats makes his act even more amazing is that its 100 clean  wow here are just a few of the gems included in regans comedy arsenalsnowcones at the end a little league gamesscience fair projectsyour feet on the hump in the middle back seatdriving through blasting zonesinjury reports to your motherbotched crank phone callsdonuts with sprinkles on just one sidebrain regan may not have the most intellectually stimulating material ie  george carlin richard pryer but his delivery is the best ive ever heard  he puts on this almost chicago guy twang at the end his stuff that never fails to kill me  i wish the visuals came with this cd because i know regan is almost as good as jim carey in that respectjerry seinfeld eat your heart out  brian regan is the king of clean comedy|1
this release is modern science looking out for us music lovers as well the great friendship thriving among these men have paved my road for a concert trip i hope they play most of this album on their fall tour new sounds abound from all three bravoi should add that the lyrics are poetry and should be read and for those that refuse maybe a bandaid box would provide some entertainment and i mean attainment sorry it just seems that some humans are struggling and i dont mean to be cynical i mean to just saywake up|1
from the first tune to the last this album was full of subtle surprises from the first track youre taken on a trip around the world even when the flavors change the you still recognize the band and especially the groove this album definetly grooves and if you appreciate top notch musicianship smooth jazz and a good groove this album is for you|1
i will start by being completely up front about two things1 i am a huge rush fan2 i do not now nor expect to any time soon own an mp3 player nor enjoy anything about the concept  i am an album person  i like to hear everything an artist has decided to release at that moment in their career  i do expect filler songs i do expect highs and lows but i call an album great if it can take me somewhere make me actually feel something deep down inside when i listen to it from beginning to end  and theres just something irreplacable about holding that jewelcase or vinyl jacket in your handsso here we are in 2012  go ahead try to think of any band new or old that can release a truly great album of material that is discussed in its entirety song by song that actually takes you on a journey from beginning to end  a cohesive collective work that in its entirety not just radio release 1 2 etc is really something to savor enjoy discuss digest  in my opinion there is only one band that does that consistantly today  and that band is not rush surprised nope imho that band is none other than porcupine tree  but enough about themrush is now and will forever be my favorite all time band  but nothing since power windows other than a little gold nugget called counterparts really sold me as a solid fronttoback album  that is until 6122012 and the release of clockwork angelsthis work has reminded me what a great rush album was  forget popping an earbud off your head and handing it to your buddy saying hey check this song out  this is one of those rare works that harkens back to when i grew up and a friend of mine called me and simply said dont go anywhereim coming over and im bringing something i want you to hear which incidentally was hemispheres on vinyl  me  fan forever  dont get me wrong ive found tons to love from rushs recent releases  theyve all impressed me to varying degrees and i enjoy them all very much  but clockwork angels moved me  i get chills i feel those butterflies in the stomach i have verses and choruses and solos still bouncing around in my head after i hear it  it moves and breathes and plays with your emotions  its full of magic moments its bold its heartfelt  its everything a great album should beso go ahead pick up clockwork angels and get lost in its depths  then call a buddy go to his or her house and share the magic|1
when i heard that not only rush would release a new album but for the first time a new release from my favorite band of 30 plus years released on my birthday so i really hoped that they would release a nice piece of work and they succeeded  i listened to this twice already and each song kicks ass and has me on my feet nonstop going back to a conceptional work since hemespheres is a nice change in the directions they always amaze us with but this album also sounds fresh and full of new ideas and no geddy dont scream in his vocals anymore  not that he could anymore anyways  this album is a much heavier album then even vapor trails and counterparts which were pretty heavy for thier time after an almost 40 year career  rush still knows how to deliver the goods and know how to keep themsleves creativewhich other long time bands tend to get in a rut and a lot of new bands cant even touch the talents of this trio thank you rush for the best bday gift i have had in such a long time|1
nothing against the music at all its a solid colleciton but it could be on one disc for around 10 bucks capitol will say and has said they want to preseve the integrity of the original two record set by having two discs but having released the 1 collection with 30 songs on one disc this is nonsense its a money grab prepare to be gouged again beatlemaniacs|0
slashs second solo album features just about exactly what you would expect sleazy rock n roll in the west coast la glam tradition  there are lots of gritty guitar solos and the vocal histrionics of myles kennedy soars above it all  unlike slashs last solo effort from 2010 that featured a myriad of guest stars this album features slashs touring band with gives the album a bit more cohesiveness  kennedy is one of the great vocalists in rock today and his presence here on all of the tracks really brings slashs music to a new level  all that being said i dont think this album is quite as strong as the last one from 2010  the songwriting here is good but with 14 tracks it ends up having a bit of sameness about it all  still if hard hitting old school rock n roll is what you are looking for this album certainly delivers  slash is playing better than ever and obviously the fact that these guys toured together for over a year has made them a tight as hell musical outfit  overall i dont think this one quite rises to the level of its predecessor but it is a solid 4 star album|1
anyone whos a fan of pink floyd absolutely must have this its a great cd one of my favorites i love it|1
not sure how long ago this came to me or where from but i just love this little collection of christmas songs its geared toward children but is a feelgood for any thoughtful adult as well a balanced mix of rollickinghumorous and reverentsoulful a couple of the songs are not as appealing to me so i just skip them but other than that this is the music i play when im ready to feel christmas now|1
wow  this cd is probably one of the best  i even love the song the garden more then tom sawyer it is so beautifulthe lyricseverything  i also like bu2b an excellent song and seven cities of gold  i would not be surprised if this goes gold or platinum if it already hasnt  every song is excellentgeddy sounds great  i cant say enough good things about this cd  buy ityou wont be disappointed|1
this production is a mix of different styles and genres mariachi technocumbia cumbias popballad  the sound is very much like selena quintanillas music greatly in part because selenas brother ab quintanilla is the producer for the exception of the last track pena de amor y muerte sentence of love and death which is by renowned producercomposer juan carlos calderon  there is a difference between the first 9 tracks and the last track almost as if that last track was thrown in the production in a moments decision which it was  coincidentally this track was used as the theme song for veronica castros novela soap opera pueblo chico infierno grandeif you like selenas music you might like this cd although it has no particular theme or direction  the best song by far is pena de amor y muerte which i know youll enjoy its beautiful lyrics and arrangements juan carlos calderon the producer and writer is also behind the successes of mocedades maria conchita alonso luis miguel alejandra avalos and many more|0
im not sure if im listening to the same thing as all of the raving fans of this album are at first i had to check my ipod to make sure i hadnt selected the wrong recording because this is just as disappointing as previous releaseslet me state for the record that i am a diehard rush fan as well as a musician rush was an inspiration when i started playing unfortunately this album is yet another in a string of disappointments for me as a fan and as a musiciannow let me review lets just first all agree pearts lyrics are absurd theyve always been absurd who cares did any of us really start listening to rush because of the lyricsthe songs in terms of musical composition are dull monotonous mostly in a minor tonality and all of very similar tempo even after several listenings there isnt a single thing that sticks in my head thats not a good signpearts drumming has gone from finesse and amazing creativity to the kind of hamhanded pounding that people usually associate with my limited drumming skills unfortunately that has been the case for some time now lees singing is as dull and monotonous as the compositions lifeson gets a little more spotlight on this one but theres really nothing special about what hes doing maybe the production is a little better here but thats as far as ill goi hate to compare the recent work of a band thats been around for a long time to the work from earlier in their career especially when the early work was so spectacular everybody needs to move forward but perhaps its time the guys look back and evaluate what made some of their earlier work so good not popular but good  it was different groundbreaking and the playing gave you holy cow he did what moments when you heard rush playing even without lees singing you knew it was rush today its lees singing thats the only thing identifying the band take his vocals out and the band could be any one of the forgettable bands that are out there these daysyes my expectations are high so maybe im just bitter i keep waiting for a new rush album that gets played a few times grabs me and becomes the only thing i listen to for months it hasnt happened in a long time and it certainly didnt happen with clockwork angels|0
wish you were here sounds like an entirely different band from the one that made the classic dark side of the moon  that album was beautiful and kaleidoscopic  this one is boring longwinded and meanspirited  the first song alone must go for twenty minutes  and the best song here the title song sounds like a wallflowers castoff  a lot of people love this album but i dont know why|0
brian regan is really funny and hes clean which is a really nice change from so many comedians being foul in their routines|1
i bought winds of worship as a giftit is a fantastic cd  however the cd quit working so we tried using other cd players  it didnt work on any cd player  the cd players work because we tried other cds which do play  so how do i go about getting a replacement cd  seems like there should be some warranty  thanks|0
i cant help but wonder why you are not giving potential customers some info regarding what is on this disc how many tracks are there what musical genre is it help us out a bit here i love the moody blues but have virtually no info about the stuff the band members did as solo artists also you dont mention whether or not this is a bootleg wasnt threshold the label all of the band members used after they started their own label some good oldfashioned honesty  you know  truth in advertising  would be a good thing|0
pink floyds the wall is the kind of album that had i reviewed it five or six years ago my opinion would have been quite different as a teenager going through those emotional ups and downs of adolescence its easy to see how the albums theme of isolation and loneliness can resonate with you but as i grew out of that stage i looked back on the wall with much less fondness than i had musically the wall displays very little of the progessive tendencies of previous pink floyd landmarks such as dark side of the moon and wish you were here in fact at times it sound quite to be frank ordinarythe wall is a twodisc rock opera about a rock star named pink who has been beaten down by life since day one after losing his father in the war he is raised by a smothering overprotective mother and at school is forced to deal with his cruel teachers when he grows up his wife leaves him and feels suffocated by the pressures of being a rock star all this leads pink to create a psychological wall with every painful experience a brick to separate him from the rest of the world inside his wall he imagines himself to be a fascist dictator until at last his conscience rebels and puts him on an imaginary trial where the wall is finally broken down its easy to see many an angsty alienated teenager finding comfort in these songs particularly another brick in the wall part ii but for everyone else the storyline comes across as needlessly selfpitying and overdone the story fails to generate any real interest if a band insists on telling a story through an album i hold them to the same standard as i would if they had told it through any other medium we arent given much reason to care about the main character pink or feel sorry for him i doubt many people will be able to relate to richbutalienated rock stars the story tries to sound as though it is portentous and full of deep meaning but it lacks depth and emotional impactthis is symptomatic of the fact that roger waters at this point in time had almost complete control of the band with the exception of a few tracks this is essentially a waters solo album as a result the music suffers greatly with the exception of killer tracks like comfortably numb and run like hell the songs on the wall are bland and ordinary compared to previous pink floyd release totally lacking in anything that might be considered progressive opener in the flesh for example is a kind of arenarock that sounds much like something queen would do theres none of the eerie ethereal sound effects of dsotm or wywh that made the band something unique the wall sounds like a very ordinary rock album its not a bad rock album but its not pink floydpart of the problem is that the storyline takes precedence over the music many tracks are simply there to advance the plot and cannot stand by themselves these filler tracks while necessary i suppose to tell the story waters wanted to tell only serve to frustrate the listener by breaking up the musical flow and making the whole ordeal much longer than it should the musical highlights of the wall could have easily have been condensed onto a single disc the rest is pure bloat delving into needlessly theatrical bombast as waters parades around his suffering for all to seeas i have said the wall is not an album that has aged well for me roger waters endless selfpitying and the albums dearth of elements that made pink floyd so great just drag the album down into mediocrity the followup the final cut was even more rogerscentered than this and its easily one of pink floyds worst draw your own conclusions|0
not exactly sure which release date my cd is but i had no problems with the sound qualitythere are versions of this which are listed as being remastered but that was done years ago apparently will limit this review to just the songs that i think are particularly noteworthyor remind me of other songs anyway this is the first album described as a concept album where i can actually see that the label is meaningful and not just a woolly term applied more in hope than certainty as you listen to this double cd album youll realise that it is thematically coherent and the songs relate to the unfolding story that second listen had me pick up on the trajectory of the albums central characterthe album gives you their conception and points to their death it comes across as filmic in quality with ambient soundbites which paint a picture of an artist in declinephysical and mental these moments are like scenes in a  movie subsequent listens reinforce this perception and make it even clearer recently watched a docu which made me realise that perhaps the concept behind this album was even clearer when viewed in concert that docu might have been which ones pink or the multiepisode docu series on the history of rock music by the bbcseven ages of rock the episode this album featured if it did would have been the one concerning stadium rock  in any case my point is that watching the album performed in concert would create the necessary imagery to grasp the nature of the story contained in the work the album did that well enough in my view but watching the docu made me realise i was missing elements which would have made the album clearer in intentthe classicsthe happiest days  like a lot of tracks on this album it features a cool transition to it from the previous song you hear a helicopter then the musical theme of the following track is established great vocal theatre in the song a brilliant operatic score drums are interesting at the end more themes and motifs of the following track are introducedanother brick in the wall part 2  another brilliant transition to this song great lyrics cool guitar and especially bass guitar work at the start the guitar solo at the end of this song is my pick as the greatest guitar solo of all time the childrens choir in the middle is also really cool an all time great songcomfortably numb  makes use of the preceding songs lyrics bassy synth cool vocal theatre has beautiful swirling violin type sounds the lyrics are excellent not sure if this is the first song that deliberately includes extraneous human noisesyou hear the singer clear his throat at the start maybe jimi hendrix did this kind of stuff toojust dont remember in one hendrix song you could hear him chewing gum but i dont think that that was intentional like it was in other songs of hisrun like hell  yet another really cool intro with the riff and beat sounds like gilmour is rubbing the guitar strings initially for effect this track should have been on their best of echoes the riff is good and openbest of the restoutside the wall  pleasant mellow genteel music and singing piano accordion and childrens choir featurebest of the rest on second listenthe thin ice  opens with a baby crying synthy track with a slow tempo piano tinkling gets a bit rock with the lead guitar styleanother brick in the wall part 1  very nice note picking on the guitardelicate and a little ethereal synthesiser plays musical motifs that we know from brick part 2andmother  starts with an exhalation as if to summon the strength to sing the song about the unhealthy relationship with the central characters mum acoustic guitar organ and bassy sound featureby the byin the flesh  has black sabbath open riffs type rock starts with the harmonica then gets gothic  veers to more normal type rock with a good tone to the drums and some 1950s style backing vocalsgoodbye blue sky  nice acoustic guitar part which reminds me of metallicas immortal song fade to

discernable concept to be foundnot as coherent as the wall though it seems to mefrank zappa  the mothers of invention   freak out a pleasant listen cant really discern any concept behind this album occasionally challenging to listen to if you only like pleasant music gets whimsical and jazzy at timesking crimson  in the court of the crimson king a pleasant listen for the most  apart from the more raucous opening track title track is a beautiful classic not sure what the concept is here eitherthe beatles  sgt peppers lonely hearts club band overrated so dont go in expecting a masterpiece a day in the life is a bona fide masterpiece though a very slight concept to this albumwhich has been overblown in my opinion  some beatles say as much themselves|1
i wasnt a big fan of this lp but it had its good moments not many thoughi wouldnt recommend|0
as audio needs to deliver imagery and laughs through voice alone this recording turns out to be more refined and vivid than the video of the same name the pacing is slower yes but the setup is more succesful and not rushed as in the movie bernhard tries on personalities and develops entire scenarios that revel in a jaded nonmainstream view of the cutlture it should have panned out for her but the culture was in a dumbening trend that still hasnt peaked and few can handle her challenging material or her signature bitterness|1
the seller sent me the wrong cd  it is not the one pictured here  i wanted a specific interview off this cd and was very disappointe dto get the wrong one  not sure it is worth trying to send it back for the 5 bucks it cost  but still a bummer to not get the item i ordered|0

this is a bad recording its titled the sounds of arthur lyman but sound nothing like it the bass is overemphasized to the extent that i must turn down the volume on the sub to make it bearable the tempo of the tracks are lazy and in an attempt to salvage the effort four bonus tracks from another recording are added a total waste|0
with the exception of my heart will go on by celine dion horners soundtrack is not a masterpiece but a bunch of stinking skunks who are masked by a field of sweet smelling flowersfor a soundtrack score it is not riveting and really lacks any emotional connection to the film  overall it is just really overrated and the hit single got played so much that the masses just fell into a typical zombie trance and went marching to the store to buy it  this was after they kept returning to the theater to see a fictional tale of love built around a tragic awful eventit didnt stop them though they could not get enough of seeing all those depictions of people freezing to death in the water  overall a below average soundtrack that road the coat tails of a hit single that was shoved down our throats for an entire year|0
i never understood the praise that chickenfoots first album got with the exception of a few songs down the drain is just a great tune most of the songs were about as original as dirt i mean oh yeah is about as poorly written a song as you could get i probably gave that disc a total of 7 to 8 spins and never went back to it i wanted to like it but just could not i think you can tell that these guys got together and took about a two days to write these thingsso when it was announced that iii was on the way i did not get all that excited then i heard bigfoot pretty great riff in a pretty good song but still one song does not an album make or break for that matter i then heard bits of other tunes and thought that the album had a chance to at least be better then the first of course thats not saying much but it was a starti got the album on release day and gave it a spin pretty good better then the first to say for sure i then gave it another listen i thought yeah i like this album its got some good and some skippers but its good overall then i gave it a third spin and fell in lovewhat a great album it is full a great grooves catchy choruses great guitar solos and michael anthonys backing vocals oh those wonderful volcals this is by far sammy and michaels best work together since ou812 and by far joes most fun album1 last temtation  this is one of those tunes that takes a bit but once it hooks you it sticks great chorus and a great tune to start off the album  much better then avenida revolution from the first album2 alright  first listen i thought this was going to be the albums oh yeah tune with a repetative silly dated chorus well its not its a fun song not to be taken to seriously mikes backing vocals help lift this song to a higher plain then just some ol regular throw away track great tune3 different devil  probably my least fav track but its not bad just not up to the standards of the rest of the tunes its a slower song and mikes backing vocals are great it sounds the most like some of sammys solo stuff4 up next  this was another track that i did not love at first but now i find it to be one of the albums best tracks such a great bridge with michaels vocals and a great grove by satch good stuff here5 lighten up   i really thought this would be my least fav song but i actually enjoy it now after repeat listens i thought the chorus was dull but each chorus builds a little more and makes this song a keeper6 come closer  this might be my fav song and i never pick slow songs i usually skip them but this is a great great tune sammys vocals micheals harmonies in the bridge satchs guitar plaing in the chorus all make foer an all time classic great tune i love it7 three and a half letters  right off the bat this tune opens with athonys great harmonies so thats a plus sammy just talks the verses but belts out the chorus and helps this song stand out not a great tune but not a skipper8 bigfoot  great grove  nuff said9 dubal blues  another great tune that i did not care for on first spin but love now this is a great tune again michaels backing vocals bring this song to another level great riffs and solos in this tune also love it10 something gone wrong  a slower tune to end the album its good but does not stand out its the only tune i cant remember at any given time11 untitled track  this is really how to end an album a great song and probably the heaviest on the albumnow with all the praise i gave this album you may say why only 4 stars well i like to wait and give 5 stars to all time classic albums albums that have stayed great through the years this album has a chance get back to me in 10 years|1
why the hell did this album show up in my recommended search results i dont even like this album those four french morons should have let their careers be and not have even bothered with this freak sideshow nonsense|0
lacey lead singer of the band has an incredible voice she can be quiet and touching then screaming and raw all of the sudden flyleafs sound is very original and has somewhat of a dark sound wo the dark lyrics though ive seen flyleaf and they were even better live the cd is great and a smart buy|1
pink floyd i one of my favorite bands  i have the wall and dark side of the moon on vinyl and i recently bought the wall on vinyl  the poster it comes with is amazing  the album as a whole was worth the 50 dollars i paid for it|1
the missing years should have remained missing the one part that really bothers me in the original at the time of danes death meggie says to ralph do you think i could ever go back to luke or any other man after you the meaning of course being that he should have known dane was his the missing years completely blows the whole meaning of the line along with it the premise of the show the acting was good and all in all well done except for julia blake who played fee cleary i dont think she did justice to the character created by jean simmons whose presence was sorely missed amanda donohoe did a great job shes a fine actor richard chamberlain was his usual charming and talented actor he has always been simon westaway who played luke did a fine job as well the story itself was lacking all the way around the only decent part was when they made love yet another inconsistency when he goes back to her years later meggie says and i paraphrase its not been that long just 20 years since ive seen you there are just all sorts of inconsistencys through out the whole movie henry mancinis music was also missed all in all a bad picture i would have given this film a 12 a star or zero had they been available choices if you liked or even loved the original youll be greatly disappointed spend your money for the real deal and just imagine what might have been instead of this very poor attempt to recapture the excellence of the first one believe me anything you think up and will be far better than this movie ill say it again except for julia blake who played the fee character the acting was very good including olivia burnette who played justine oneill another fine actor dont waste your time and money|0
this is one hell of an album this is a little more waters dominated and a bit more depressing than their previous albums but thats the idea this album features some of floyds greatest hits like another brick in  the wall part ii comfortably numb and  run like  hell it cant really be compared to any other album because its  not like any other album each song is like a chapter in the story being  told although its lacking a litle in input from the other members its  essentially a waters solo album it still sounds great gilmours guitar  riffs are as fresh as ever waters lyrics are dreamy and outstanding as  usual a must have for anyone who appreciates good music|1
when i first heard this album in 1987 i liked it  then i listened closely to the words and wondered where the imagination and creativity of floyd had gone  to make matters worse i saw the watersless version of floyd in  concert that year on their highly touted tour  the show was like an am  radio greatest hits session  i walked away more disappointed than everthe magic isnt gone but you need to listen to obscured by clouds dark  side wish you were here the wall and the final cut to find it  gilmour  is a great musician but hes no poettake away the words and  momentary lapse of reason is ok|0

the above comment isnt of a derogatory natureno not at all im still trying to figure out what just hit me and see if i can put into words how great this cd is this cd arrived in my mailbox yesterday and i immediately opened it and passively listened it at dinner with the kids of course i was hearing it rather than listening to it for that hour or so in an almost reckless fashion i had 3 stars in mind if i was going to make the mistake of reviewing it quickly instead me and the kids took a road trip today and i was able to really focus on the songs while driving and conclude that i was listening to the best rush album since moving pictures and im confident with that assessment i say this because this album shows what patience and careful craftsmanship can do the songs are tight very little deviation in sound from one to the next which is common for concept albums and very robust especially the song headlong flight which may be neil pearts best work since tom sawyer while melodies dont initially jump out of these songs they are nonetheless there and arent indulgent basically these songs have that movement to them and tell a great story amid the fast and sometimes furious tempo geddy lee has his bass thumping more than ever and neil has the energy of a 20 year old while alex and his guitars are having the time of their lives the standout tracks every track the real standout tracks caravan bu2b the wreckers headlong flight and the garden the latter is a heartfelt slower song that has the listener rooting for these guys and admiring their talent and versatility the wreckers has an addictive melody the only exception on this album all of the tracks have that feel to them and have me shaking my head and concluding that these guys have reached full maturation and not losing a thing but rather gaining momentum i think that this trio is just trying to have fun these days and its showing up in the songs that is the quality of them are high and the fact that theyre taking their time between albums these days is another huge reason for my predicted success of this album i think this album will go platinum which hasnt happened in a while i will not attribute bigger advertising for the success but rather word of mouth in how good this album is and finallyits time to tell the harsh critics of rush enough is enough and perhaps they will finally give credit where credit is due and first  acknowledge how great this album is then realize that rush has influenced so many bands who are already in the hall im sure metallica big rush fans have already listened to this album and think that this album is stellar and rolling stone will have to come forth and fess up that theyve done a great disservice to this band for too long do yourself a favor and get this cd you wont be sorry ps i heard some small parts of songs that sound like bastille day hemispheres the sphere losing it and la villa strangiato|1
pink floyd has taken the best part o themselves and put it into the wall really what more needs to be said the whole two disc set delves into the rise of a rock star through the ranks and to superstardom if you like rock and roll and u like the tracks u hear from this disc on th radio buy it the radio cant do justice to the wall when u do get it dont sit there and choose tracks that u know listen to both discs in order we all know the hits from that disc another brick in the wall pt2 comfortably numb just small bricks in the wall when you hear the whole disc youll know what i mean|1
chicken foot is an amazing group of incredibly talented guys they are true equals that dont compete with each other but instead meld together in a party of rock and roll not your traditional super group trying to make the perfect album they just rock arguably better than any other band out there|1
most tribute albums are pretty bad its a fact of life  and you know what  those bad tribute albums sound like sgt pepper compared to this one  bands youve never heard of and will never hear again most of whom cant play a lick do their own versions of rem songs that are often unrecognizable  about the only listenable cut is an italian version of pretty persuasion  ive owned over 1000 albums over my lifetime this is one of the 10 worst|0
too bad this cd was not remastered i have to agree with previous reviews that while this is one of the best interpretation of mozarts requiem the sound is muffled at time|0
this isnt a live album its a lengthy compilation of 999 songs that were all rerecorded by the band  i dont know why 77 punk bands insist on doing things like this the vibrators did this also because half the appeal of old punk rock is the stark and raw nature of the music  why redo it  if it aint broke dont fix it  unfortunately most of 999s good stuff is available as import only so this might be your only economical choice|0
this was the very first african cd i ever bought i dont remember what grade i was in but i know i was in highschool so its probably been about 10 years ago that i bought it this cd  deserves to be reviewedthe thing that continues to really get me about this album is that if you just give it a lazy listen you will miss what is actually going on with this music some of the songs have an overall contour that may seem like constant repetition if you arent really paying attention however if you are actually listening to it and not just playing it in the background as you do other things there is a world of overlapping rhythmic complexity changing and turning inside all of these songs these drums also have unique tones a rubberyness a really tight bounce i love also it just struck me that all this time i forgot about volume one i dont have that one but ill have to correct that situation soonthis is really an incredible cd to listen to outside at night ive listened to it while sitting around a campfire by a river at night before and it was a really beautiful experience sitting still would be quite a feat during this cd this is really a great example of one of the communal dance musics for which west africa is known this cd may almost make you wish you knew all your neighbors and could all come together and dance together to some of the many rhythms of life i really feel lucky that i decided to take a chance on this recording when i stumbled upon it way back when it really jumpstarted an entire world of interest in indigenous african musics for me and even now that i am much more knowledgeable than i was then it still holds up as a classic recording|1
like my dad i really love the beatles but we were both very dissapointed when we sat down with a good glass of wine to listen to the cd we ordered it didnt take long before we turned the cd off its was what we both called a flat sound we couldnt believe we spent money on such poor quality sound we compared the sound quality to the old tapes dad had and we quickly disposed the cds it wasnt only this particular cd we ordered 3 cds of the beatles and they were all bad they were all lacking the sound depth just to compare we borrowed the same cds from my dads friend but recorded in 1994 beautifull sound depth im sorry amazoncom but the cds does not deserve even one star for such poor sound quality|0
soundwise this cd is sadly lacking  everybody loves a lover appears on hard to find jukebox classics 1958 pop gold on the hit parade label and teachers pet appears elsewhere both in true stereo whereas this cd is all mono albeit from a rechanneled stereo master tape  secret love was mastered from a vinyl record as scratches are audible throughout  all tracks have reverb not heard on the original vinyl issues due to rechanneling  the collection to get isgolden girl columbia recordings 19441966a twocd set that offers most of doris days 1950s singles and film favorites as well as those from the 60s  everybody loves a lover is still mono but the audio sources are from the original mono and stereo masters and they sound terrific  skip this old greatest hits collection and get a later remastered release|0
definitely pink floyds worst album the only songs worth listening to are learning to fly and on the turning away one slip was bearable as was the beginning of sorrow but in  general this album was garbage nothing but session musicians will you find  on most of the tracks here after waters left the band pf should have just  broken up this is junk|0
i found this treasure by accident online  my favorite song is each step of the journeylove the gaelic that is spoken in some of the songs  if youre irish catholicgoing to love it even more  i also bought this cd for my aunt and she plays it to death|1
5 star album 1 star from where its made i love the floyd period but as you said digipak digipak sucks notice now that these are made in mexico whats up with our recording companies outsourcing masterpieces in mexico what next china i will tell you one thing i will quit buying music if this crap doesnt stop  once|0
as usual rush hits it out of the park with this one  wide variety of songs i hear echos from thingseffects of classic rush albums in some of these songs  not bad for a band not in the rr hall of fame how is that even possible|1
first we can all admit that this album lacks a huge timeless rock anthem like rushs classic hit tomlight of radihearthaving said that this is still rushs best album everca has a combination of mature vision with youthful creativity there are moments of almost sweet melody the wreckers moments of driving melody the anarchist and moments of blazing rock bu2b there are catchy riffs you get on the first hearing 7 cities of gold and walls of sound that take several listens to appreciate headlong flight there are straightforward powertrio sections caravan and ethereal moments that take you to another world bu2b2  clockwork angels best of all there is a work of art that ends the album too amazing to just be called a song its titled the garden and is the best possible summation of the ca story any musicians couldve composedevery song is strong and there is no filler easily 5 stars|1
full disclosure rush is my favorite band and has been for many many years  still im not one of those people that think they can do no wrong  i think their career is more interesting because theyve taken so many risks and failed quite a few times  this is a spectacular band capable of so much that has written some truly dreadful songs and released some pretty mediocre records in the past 25 years  this is not one of them  most of their stuff is spectacular and their best records are the ones that are consistently immense song to song moment to moment within songs  this is one of those rush recordsrush has been plagued by inconsistency for a while now  power windows was their last record without filler songs that wasnt too long  power windows was a great record but it sounds awfully dated awash in synths and overproduced to within an inch of its musical shelf life  every record since has featured 2 to 5 songs that could have been dropped in my opinion  when i saw that clockwork angels was another 12 song 60 minute behemoth i was expecting something in the vein of vapor trails and snakes and arrows  very good but not great and probably dragged down by an inability to edit and focus on the best tracks with the best riffs and best hooks  after listening to this album several times i was shocked to realize that theres not a mediocre song on here  in many ways this ranks as one of rushs greatest achievements  at 60 minutes its nearly twice as long as their other flawless releases hemispheres permanent waves moving pictures yet ranks among them  each song seems totally a collaboration among the three musicians and anyone who knows them should be able to pick out the respective geddy and alex written songs in the last 3 or 4 albums  they all rock hard they all feature virtuoso performances they all have devastatingly catchy hooks and they all have at least one line of lyrics that sticks with you  i think producer nick raskulineczs influence shouldnt be understated  he really encouraged them to get back to their roots and explore longer pieces and the socalled narcissistic musicianship more  it shows  there are nasty bass lines monster guitar riffs interstellar guitar leads and the heavy hand of pearts world class drumming  none of it seems overwrought and the song is never sacrificed  its something rush does better than any band in history and theyre on perfection overdrive in this regard hereanother thing that makes this record so excellent and so surprisingly so is that for the first time in 20 years the return to form cliche that critics like to trot out is actually true  their records from the last 20 years have been occasionally great make no mistake  counterparts was a welcome return to heavy rock but it owed a lot more to the grunge alt rock and 80s punk and hardcore that alex had obviously been listening to than the classic era of rush prog  vapor trails owed a lot more to tool and 90s altmetal bands like hum quicksand and shiner who i suspect influenced alex than yes and genesis  snakes and arrows sounded like a band rediscovering its early early roots from playing on the feedback tour  it featured some of rushs first genuinely bluesy songs since fly by night  but when i heard the lead guitar work on the the anarchist i finally felt the newrecord twitch of permanent wavesmoving pictures era rush id been wanting my whole life i was not yet born when those lps were released  there are songs on this record that seem to draw from the strong songwriting of all their best guitaroriented records  2112 a farewell to kings hemispheres permanent waves moving pictures presto counterparts vapor trails and snakes and arrowsi honestly didnt think rush had this record in them i love them but i thought their days of songwriting perfection were over  they just hadnt edited out filler in 25 years  this time perhaps they didnt edit out filler but everything they wrote was pure gold  this album is the exact right length because every second of it is outstanding  headlong flight is one of their 10 best songs already in my opinion  an absolutely perfect track  the wreckers is the kind of song that would have gone beautifully on presto but it is augmented with a ballsy hard rock arrangement and warm thick production that was lacking on that album the aforementioned track the anarchist could actually have gone on permanent waves or a farewell to kings and i say that as a person absolutely obsessed with those records who feels truly reverential toward them  bu2b has got to rank among the best songwriting achievements of the counterpartsclockwork angels heavy modern rock era of rushi think id be wrong not to mention that this is rushs first concept record crazy to think about for a band thats done such lengthy conceptual pieces and thematic records over the years  again i never thought theyd be touring on their first fullfledged concept record as they near their 60th birthdays  and i never thought any record theyd make in 2012 would be this outstanding  the lyrics as billy corgan noted in the beyond the lighted stage documentary when talking about neils words in general are literary but never seem condescending  the story is being told to you by neil personally based on his own experiences through the lens of this alternate future steampunk concept and he seems like hes in the room with you relating it  the whole record is a joy and its so wonderful to see these three make something so transcendent this late in their career  this might be their last one so savor it and enjoy  to me its easily their best since grace under pressure and might even exceed that record and thus be in the conversation with signals  simply put it is one of the best releases of their career and certainly one of the best records released in 2012|1
the wallthe greatest album ever made  why  well if the fact that it  has sold over 23 million copies since its initial release in december 1979  doesnt impress you which it should and the addition that it boasts one  of the most played songs on the radio of the 80sanother brick in the  wall part two perhaps i can persuade you further into forking out any  sum of money to own this masterpiece  first of all you have roger waters  the lyrical genius basically running the show  i cant claim that many  vocalistsbassists can make me laugh with lyrics like i need you to  put through the shredder in front of my friends when its applied to  such a minor tempo  then theres david gilmour  the man can play guitar  need proof  comfortably numb  rated the number four guitar solo by guitar  world  its not the last time the man appears on the list either  exchanging speed for timing and executing each note with perfection his  slow paced solos leave you begging for more  nick mason and richard wright  complete the missing rhythm and melody to give you the glory known as pink  floyd  the wall will remain a timeless classic and attract newer audiences  with each generation to come|1
not worth the moneyweird cd  regret buying itwould like a refundlove cd so much betterthough the second cd was better|0
i have everything floyd has produced and was very excited to have these remastered disks  i have a high end car stereo focal utopia and the old recordings just dont cut it with the clarity of sound of my system  i was excited to buy every disk remastered but i am glad i only bought one  the remastered sound quality is so very disappointing  they didnt even try  the disk is backed by white noise it is total trash  wish you were here even skipped out of the package and another had paint on the playing side i brought it back to the store and got the same cd but the next one skipped  total crap unworthy of the music laid down  wtf does roger and david get involved in this stuff  what an abortion of a great idea|0
love this album have loved it for years needed a new one so ordered and received it fast nice jacket also had the yiddish words and notes which i didnt get with the tape years ago lovely music and stories|1
i loved these songs when i was little and just bought them for my two nieces  definitely the best gifts for a baby shower ever because children will love these for many years to come|1
can you believe this yet another crime against art the music is really good the cover is great but the digital production stinks shame on appleemi and george martin for settling for this kind of sound quality01 no reply  101002 im a loser  101003 babys in black  101004 rock  roll music  71005 ill follow the sun  101006 mr moonlight  61007 kansas city  81008 eight days a week  101009 words of love  81010 honey dont  71011 every little thing  101012 i dont want to spoil the party  91013 what youre doing  91014 everybodys trying to be my baby  710this is obviously a 4 star album but with such poor digital production it gets 1 star so that looks like 2 12 stars|0
i was disappointed in this movie when i ordered it i was under the impression that it was part of the original madefortv movie series sadly it was not and i did not enjoy it much|0
over a decade ago andrew silverstein was stretching his 15 minutes of fame as far as it could go with his tasteless comedy  he was selling out arenas doing appearances on mtv and making a then highprofile appearance on arsenio  soon thereafter the mainstream started to wise up and realized hes really just another sham and he faded into obscurity  here is the album that made him famous and its funny only if youre under 14 and happen to break out in giggles at the sound of the fbomb  people i think this is as bad as it gets  i remember buying this cd out of curiosity in college  it was so disgusting i sold it the very next day and took a hot shower because listening to it made me feel so unclean  if you havent already exposed yourself to the work of andrew dice clay theres no reason to do so now  hes a hasbeen and should stay that way|0
this a great cd add 5 points to the first one and thats what you have with this one i have always been a hagar fan good grooves on this one i really like three and a half letters track 7 hits home in the usa today oh best reason to buy this cd its made in the usa something to think about all you downloading ipoders cd print stopage takes away more jobs|1
italian music from st laurent quebec canada i guess that is what one would expect sounds like a bunch of frenchcanadian college students trying to audition in a fauxitalian bar it is pretty bad i dont know how they get gloria as an italian favorite if you want italian cafe music dont buy this one a waste of money|0
i am missing most of the excitement here if you think 20th century music should be dull and boring then this is your cd sorry but this is no match for say the latest la phil recording under esapekka salonen which just sparkles with energy and drang just naming one recent example here sawallisch makes me fall asleepa major disappointment go where the exitement is go hollywood|0
not to take anything from the rest of the album but the garden is the best song from them since losing it  its very reminiscent but so much better  and yes the rest is the best since counterparts easily|1
as i put this cd in my player i started to groove to the first track  push the button after that opening track i was punished with  about 20 more boring unoriginal tracks  if he is going to put a sticker on  his cd saying he is a keyboardist for the beastie boys he better bring a  little more funk and a lot less um well boring stuff he is not a funky  monkey|0
i ordered this cd for teaching preschoolers thru music the product itself is wonderful but i think it took a little longer to receive it after ordering it a little over 2 wks the songs are catchy it teaches kids the names of fruits parts of the body five senses emotions colors etc by following the lyrics to the song many songs ask students to repeat after the singer or follow his directions students learn to listen imitate his words and follow directions an easy way to teach that is effective and fun like teaching in automatic pilot good for parents to teach kids at home or in the car while driving too as children sing along and learn i am a fan of mr leto he has another cd time for music ii too it continues where time for music leaves off   for example where cd i teaches the names of fruits cd ii teaches names of vegetables i wish he would come out with a cd to teach alphabets numbers shapes and phonics really worth it for parents and teachers  kids will remember the songs without effort and so will adults|1
most definitely dont bother with the remastered versions they have vocals on one side of the room and the music on the other  unless your stereo has the ability to combine both do buy the mono or origional stereo if available|0
so what happened last night i listened to the engineers talking about how they decide it was time to do a more modern digital transfer since the first cds were transferred in 1986 this is a good arguement i have heard some cds from the eighties that sounded pretty bad but they blamed it on the analog source not the poor digital transfer and quality of dacs and so on so without being able to sample any of rubber soul i bought it like an idiot took it home and played it i am spoiled a grateful dead fan who release very hi end cds  even of seventies 2 track live stuff i started listening to this and it sounded dull and lifeless without any good tonal qualities i have 2 cd players one a very good multi disc player with 24 bit dacs i tried it in my cheaper one and it sounded worse i ended up listening to it thru my nice sennheiser phones and it was very stringent sounding and the bass was pounding in on my left ear so i started reading the liner notes and found that this was made from a 1987 george martin stereo mix not from the new digital transfer which took 4 years it really made me mad i mean this sounded like something that had been recorded on a 4 track cassette recorder and put on cd with bouncing tracks and stuffso why was i lied to i listened to this 17 minute blurb with the creators and then you dont even get what they were talking about that is insane the beatles should sound better than this i listened to some older cds of the beatles while i was in the store where i bought this and they sounded real good especially the love album with lots of greatest hits you could not preview these on the stores machine though i am very disappointed and will sell this mix what a real digital ripoffi did notice a huge increase in quality on the last couple of songs but looked and i dont think they were on the original rubber soul it did not have 14 songs|0
just when i thought there would never be anyone who could massacre christmas music any worse than mannheim steamroller along comes the transsiberian orchestra to prove me wrong the entire disc is sixtyplus minutes of trite overproduced christmas drivel with clichedriven rock guitars bland vocals and enough bombast to sink a hundred titanicsits hard to tell what the point behind some of these songs are supposed to be is christmassarajevo 1224 trying to make some kind of political statement on promises to keep is john williams going to sue these guys for rippingoff somewhere in my memory and whats with the laughably bad tom waits imitation on old city barmany of the songs are retitled christmas standards with a very little something added in a pointless attempt by the group to make the songs their own for example a star to follow is really god rest ye merry gentlemen with new insipid lyrics and vocals that are repetitive to the point of nausea a mad russians christmas is dance of the sugar plum fairies with those damn blasting guitars yet again and the prince of peace is actually the holly and the ivy with again new insipid lyricsany way you look at it this disc is an embarrassment and a slap in the face to centuries of legitimately good christmas music dont even bother|0
this music is a perfect gowith for tai chi  i do listen and practice everydayvery soothing always in the background|1
i enjoylove much of bernsteins recordings  quite a few of them can be compared among the finest available  the most common complaint against bernstein is his taking liberties from the score in his tempi something gershwin and stravinsky railed against him for in bernsteins recording of their works  his dramatic flair and often slightly excessive tempi usually work well in highlighting the musics emotion  however this recording isnt one of those momentsbernsteins bizarre reading of the enigma variations especially in the most important variation that anchors this work nimrod is a disaster  he drags the orchestra through nimrod at such a slow pace that it reduces this variation from profundity to a funereal dirge unworthy of elgars closest friend and publisher august jaeger whom this variation was named for and was alive at the time of this composition in german jaeger means hunter  nimrod from the bibles genesis book was a mighty hunter  one would think jaeger was dead and that elgar wrote this piece as a funereal elegy not a moving and living tribute to his friend  i cant even listen to it anymore without cringing  nimrod is marked adagio in the score and in almost every recording takes between 25 to 3 mins to play  bernstein plays it at a grave or larghissimo tempo running in at around twice the time as other interpretations  6 mins  in rehearsal for this recording according to the records producer nimrod ran even longer 75 mins  do the bpm counting for yourself when you listen to his nimrod next time and youll see he isnt even in the ballpark of the tempo marked in the score  here are the accepted bpm beats per minute for slow tempo markings in classical musiclarghissimo  very very slow 19 bpm and undergrave  slow and solemn 2040 bpmlento  slowly 4045 bpmlargo  broadly 4550 bpmlarghetto  rather broadly 5055 bpmadagio  slow and stately literally at ease 5565 bpmi consider this recording to be bernsteins greatest recording disaster and what exemplifies his tendency to slow tempi down below what the composer intended and for which he received much criticism for though not all of it justified  in years after when the press would ask bernstein about this recording he refused to comment on it which indicates to me that he may have felt he laid an egg  musicians are usually effusive when they feel positive about their work and withdrawn or diffident when they feel otherwise  some people may like the drawnout pace but it is not what the composer intended and the job of a conductor is to try and stay as true as possible to a score while adding their spin on it not rewrite itunfortunately the performance of nimrod is so distracting that it ruins the rest of bernsteins enigma which isnt bad and is quite decent although not in the same league as barbirolli and other luminous performances  if youre looking for diversity in your enigma portfolio want to hear what enigma would have sounded like under celibidache or just want a bizarre piece of interpretation then consider this  i would not make this my first second or even third choice|0
jeez any more of this and ill be brainwashedwait some of you have no matter help is at handno doubt most of you have bought this new remastered version just cos it has the new beatless logo on the side of the box but to be honest its just another rehash of something that is readily availableand to top it all of its not even that good music is bland and uninspiring cant hear the instruments properly or clearly singing is out of keynope definite miss|0
simply put this is the best album rush has released in 30 years i think clockwork angels has to be mentioned along with 2112 and moving pictures as one of the best rush albums ever|1
i admit i listened to pink floyd  when i was a teenager did i like them though or simply bowing to peer pressure for the life of me i cant rememberanyway to say that this band has soured on me is an understatement roger waters isnt a very good singer none of the members are good instrumentalsits the melodies are basicyou get the picture coupled with an infuriating tendency of their fans to look down their noses at most other bands and their fans dude floyd are classic if you dont like floyd you know nothing about music these people may as well have a placard around their necks saying punch me please im a pseduointellectual pompous nerd liking pink floyd doesnt make you smarter or classier ive got more admiration for people who can see past all the gimmickry of pink floyd and see them in all their mediocrityfurthermore the much touted idea of pink floyd going well with chemical refreshment doesnt send out a very encouraging signal id prefer to enjoy a piece of music on its own merit not having to resort to potentially harmful chemcials to get the most out of my new cdim nearing 40 now and i suppose many people will expect me to say mtv is trash pink floyd are the true saviours of rock personally id prefer it if youngsters realised that rock music is about having a good time not delving into pretentious claptrap if i want some music with more depth well theres this guy called ludwig van beethoven i wouldnt touch pink floyd with a ten foot barge pole|0
we have always enjoyed brian regans comedy and this cd did not dissapoint|1
i cant describe how horrible this band is and how disappointing it is to know that people actually get suckered into listening to this the industry is beating a dead horse rightnow in this genre and any band no matter how bad they are will do come on now people we can do better than this|0
this is not pink floyd never was never will be this is david gilmour doing a solo album and trying to do the 80s pop sound that was so loved at the time hasnt aged well i dont think nick mason and rick wright did any songwriting on this album |0
high high quality recording from excellent musicians produce a number of gems on this cdparticulaly  el cascabel el coco maria chuchena balaju  el ahualulco|1
slash at his finest guitar fans will love it nice vocals excellent musically a must for slashs fans buy it|1
an album like this usually comes when the band is all out of ideas or has hit a creative slump  linkin park a few years back had this same exact idea with reanimation which also flopped in the eyes of the fans and criticsthis album would be fine if bush made it available to the fan club members or offered it for a reduced price such as 599 or so but to charge basically full price is a joke  this album is only targeted at current bush fans and bush fans onlytheres certainly no need to buy this album unless you get it for 1 or so and you like the remix of the song mouth which got decent airplay on radio all over the country|0
ive been a huge fan for decades i just listened to this new offering from begining to end and nothing got my attention until the last song the garden which shows some sweet melodic guitar work everything else just sounds like the worst of the worst from rush recycled melodies and groovesi dont even see how i could enjoy this live expected more from them and sad to say but their best work is way gone for me|0
i got the  red vinyl copy in and it was awesomeit ranks up there as album of the year i think this is the one that will have alot of guitarist learning the songs for yearsanastasia is a good song we will roammyles kennedy has an awesome voice as wellget ready for the tour|1
simple entertainment at its best  enjoyed thoroughly his humor without dirty words and a bunch of sex crap keep doing what you do best brian cd was great thanks for prompt delivery and service price was great also|1
i am not the best flyer and in recent years had become more anxious whenever i took a plane trip  i took this cd on the plane with me last year and listened to it as we took off it completely relaxed me and took my mind off of flying  i even fell asleep  now whenever i take a plane trip  i take this or the just breathe cd with me|1
well folks i am starting my third listen of the new rush i have yet to read along with the lyrics so im not really sure what the story is about  as you may know it is a concept album and the first outright complete concept album rush has ever done  certainly albums like grace under pressure and roll the bones were concepts in that they had a basic theme running through most of the songs but this one is a complete story which has been turned into a novel and will in turn be made into a filmin my opinion it is probably their most consistent album since power windows  when i say consistent i mean that i like every single song on the album  even more recent albums i have liked such as counterparts or snakes and arrows have had at least one song i really really dislike counterparts had speed of love and snakes and arrows had faithless  and then an album like roll the bones had two songs i really detesta dj and huge rush fan in new york named eddie trunk called it their heaviest album since a farewell to kings  i have to disagree on this point  sure it is a heavy album  i dont think it is any more heavy than vapor trails  and there are plenty of soft passages to give you a little break  the last song which is titled the garden is probably one of their best slow songs ever  in fact the last four songs are just incredible  it is one of those albums that just gets stronger toward the endthe one gripe i would have is the engineering on the record  i really dont think rush has had many albums that just sound good since they stopped using terry brown as their producer  i realize that the producer isnt the end all when it comes to sound  that is more in the hands of the person who does the mixing and then the mastering engineer  i know that rush uses a guy named rich chycki who is a friend of alex  i also know that alex has a big hand in mixing these days  just because he is a member of the band doesnt mean he knows how to mix  there is way too much bottom end to the mix in my opinion  as ive grown older i have been able to appreciate a warm sound but this is just ridiculous  i actually had to turn the bass levels down in my car and they were pretty low to begin withanyway if you dont have this oneget it  it is fantastic|1
i dont think this is floyds best album but it is rock solid  ive always prefered meddle to this  still its a must own for any floyd fan or rock enthusiast in general|1
the coarseness directness and emotional flatness of this 1988 german cd are disappointing in the extreme and can have the effect of making you wonder why schubert wrote this music at all it was one of my first schubert cds and nearly put me off him for life it was only when i comparatively recently bought the equally lowpriced harmonia mundi cd by jeanclaude pennetier reacutegis pasquier and roland pidoux that i began to appreciate the beauties and the highlystrung emotional qualities of this exciting music the french musicians are so much better than the stuttgart trio that i hardly know where to start just listen to both cds and you will see what i mean its not only the delicate playing the absolutely convincingly interplay between the instruments you can almost see pidoux and pasquier looking at each other and delighting in complementing each others phrasing and the superb rubato which makes the difference but also the sound engineering which is a whole universe better on the french disc i am normally a naxos fan but in this case i can only say sorry folks but harmonia mundi is better by galaxies|0
i thought this would bring songs and it had more talking than songs it was not what i thought it was and it is not what it appears|0
this is really very bad jesus christ superstar is one andrew lloyd webbers best scores and this recording really ruins it the orchestrations remind me of some really bad 80s music i do not recommend this to anyone those new to jcs will not understand how amazing this score really is and old fans will just be confused as to why something so great was ruined|0
i paid too much for this cd amazons service is great service is 5 stars this cd is defective the first song has a short gap in the recording almost as if the needle fron a turn table jumped off the vinyl there are other cd available for less money the music is great an the flute is magnificent i would not recommend buying it|0
the wall along with the dark side of the moon was one of the greatest cds ever recorded by any group due to songs like comfortably numbthis great cd should be there in yiur collectionhighly recommended|1
i ran kicking mule when bob brozman recorded an lp for us i thought then what i think now he is the greatest acoustic blues guitarist living and one of the all time greats unfortunately he did not record truckload for us i believe he did it for sky ranch a french company and later rounder released it in the us but im not sure i wish i had released it because this cd all by itself would justify my quarter century in the music businessim a lawyer now and sold the record company over 10 years ago but i still do a radio show and i play tracks from this cd from time to time i recommend to you the backwards blues it is not only a great parody it is a great piece of music you set the market stands out too listen to tracks from this cd if youve never heard of bob brozman  if you like the blues youll like his music|1
i was expecting something along the lines of strunz and farah after hearing only one tune on the radio what a disappointment  there is that one song it is clearly different from the rest of the tracks and thankfully it contains no kings vocals which are as grating on the ears as pigs in heat  of course there are some reveiwers as reflected by all the stars following this album around who relish this stuffif you are new to these guys beware  taste the sauce first on someone elses dime before you buy|0
great album even with all of the selfindulgent lyrics fault me for not analyzing things enough i just love the music on this album  young lust and the trial are two of the better ones along with the obligatory comfortably numb is there anybody out there and another brick in the wall part 2buy it if you dont have it you must|1
wonderful cd i wish i got it when she a bit younger shes 4 now|1
this album may be 12 years old but it is without question my all time favorite when it comes to christmas cds what first impressed me about it is that its not all the same songs you hear on everybody elses christmas albums these songs are so unique so beautifuly arranged and classic michael w smith i saw smitty in concert tonight with the nashville symphony and was reminded once again what a gifted incredible musician he is he played several songs from this cd backed by the full orchestra along with his own band  awesome i love this cd so much i play it year round and never tire of it a must have for any christmas cd library|1
only 4 the k people thats the name of this cdsingle its a single with one unreleased track along with an eighty page booklet with biographydiscography and history of the brothers i have a copy of it my self its a very rear single to get so if youre a big fan of the chems without a doubt buy it|1
dont chose this one  there are sooooo many others of stellar and spectacular performanceslook for the adrian boultits a knockout|0
unlike the initial reviewer of this work a music fan who obviously knows and loves this work i cannot profess an a priori knowledge of it however i do have an ear for good sounds and this cd definitely hasnt got it i  have the currently deleted hyperion recording of brians symphony no 3  which is one of the most astounding and absorbing symphonies i know  according to this gripping rendition however in sharp contradistinction  to this splendid cd on hyperion on this recording of the symphony no 2 the  performance and recording sound to my ear totally fudged and awash with  error the structure of the work seems to fall apart and maybe the poor  recording quality actually hides aspects of the poor performance that is  how bad it gets taking the electrifying recording of the third symphony  as my baseline i now truly believe that brian isnt being well served by  marco polo in their brian cycle in mitigation it might be argued that  the musical qualities of this unique voice possibly more than any other  are impossible to define and extremely hard to pull off in performance the  way brian uses his orchestra is so individual that the deployment of his  forces small or large changes like the english weather throughout each  work bar on bar making exceptional demands on his performers no half  hearted attempt or even less than exact will do however as a general  rule brian should be played with bite conviction and precision all  qualities that this cd lacks in spades i wonder if they didnt rehearse  this through but played it through after a couple of stabs at it and then  got tired and went home i cannot fathom how the performers and engineers  signed it off in this miserable state i am possibly using a bit of  hyperbole but this recording with its lacklustre photo of brighton pavilion  on the cd cover reflecting the sad contentsis totally disappointing this  colorful and exciting building used by marco polo because this symphony  was first played in brighton here looks flat and uninteresting an  achievement in itself in negative terms and this has an almost  metaphysical connection with the miserable contents  this is particularly  hard when we are literally gagging for any recordings of this great  composer at all i have been disappointed at all the marco polo offerings  and like my friend before me would like another company to have a go as  they obviously lack the animus possidendi to carry this worthy project  through marco polo do not have the resources to undetake it  professionally and judgementally when another company take it on you  could sign me up for a complete set in advance if they take it on please  rerecord these marco polo attempts maybe we will actually think fondly of  them when we are playing our new set in repose but not now another cd to  be consigned to the back of my cabinet beyond the pale sadly|0
this album has good songs im so tired novel songs why dont we do it in the road and just plain ole ugly songs wild honey piethere is little to no flow from song to song it plays like a mixtape which is not desireable when the product is toted as an album and one of the greatest of all time at thatbut even throwing all exceptations and hyperbole aside its still sketchy mediocore flat out boring and tedious in some parts revolution 9 is frankly disturbing and selfimportant and should have never made it onto anyones albumbut turning the focus to talk about the things that are positivedear prudence is uplifting and sunny julia is one of lennons most beautiful and poetic numbers blackbird is a fantastic ballad with catchy and skillful guitar playing happiness is a warm gun is a great song in and of itself and also inspired paranoid android by radiohead which is arguably just as great helter skelter flatout rocks no more needs to be said im so tired has an interesting song structure and dynamic vocals from lennon yer blues is a good song with a terrible title which does detract from it a littlenow lets take a look a couple of the novelty songs from this albumwhy dont we do it in the road is the best of them because its the least novel and most explosive one minor complaint is only that its too short and very sparse the recording feels more like a demo but the song itself is great back in the ussr is runner up and is one of the funnest beatles songs ever written its unfortunate that paul mccartney reinvisioned it as being some kind of social gesture of goodwill to the ussr in his live in red square dvd its a silly song based off chuck berry and the beach boys and its difficult to believe it has any greater meaning than thatthe remainer of the songs range from pleasantly boring and harmless i will to horrendous the aforementioned bane known as wild honey piethe white album would have been better released as a single album but since it can only be judged as a double it doesnt score high it gets 2 stars|0
this music is the most magical imaculant secret spells that we have ever found  it just sends you all the way to the land of waking dreams and feels like the deliverance of some long lost secretenhancement that those worthy can find in these changing timesthe songs aqua marine and bird of paradise conjure up a growingmagic that those who search for such things will be completely satisfied with you just have to hear it to believe it the song lavender down is very deep and full of meaning that developes more each time you hear it if your into magic and love its a must go for it yes|1
i was very happy with my purchase hubby was even happier that i got this for him a plus plus|1
im continually amazed by these three great musicians geddys voice just keeps going and alex is always inventing new sounds with his guitar the solos are longer on this album and of course the writing by mr peart is an interesting and unusual story all the lyrics are printed along with great illustrations and pictures its great to follow along while listening through the old headphones|1
this is one of the best albums slash has ever done its almost a mashup of all of slashes different bands it has the sound of guns n roses slashs snake pit velvet revolver and his solo album slash all rolled into one myles kennedy also adds some great range to the album himself of course he brings some of the sounds from alter bridge but also gives it sound similar too wolfmotheri must have listened to this album 10 times through before i changed my playlist|1
she waited to record this role until her french was good enough  or so she said  she was also worried that critics would complain shed lost her top notes  shame she worried so much about what others thought as this recording came way too late in her career  the noticeable break in her register makes it sound as if two women are portraying the lead role and shes curiously cool in temperament for such a role  she is at a disadvantage not having performed the role on stage although leontyne price overcame that obstacle in her recording with von karajan  pretres conducting is unremarkable which leaves us to marvel at the beautiful don jose of nicolai gedda  but hes heard to better advantage on beechams recording with de los angeles  her interpretation though a bit cool itself still makes me hear her as an intelligent but tragic and temperamental woman  the recording is clear and bright but a bit distorted in climaxes im no fan of callas but i respect and admire her work and enjoy several of her recordings  this however is one im trading inthere are too many superior alternatives to recommend this recording  beechamde los angeles karajanprice abbadoberganza soltitroyanos and even bernsteins most theatrical met version with horne and mccracken all offer much greater listening pleasure and sense of drama|0
i have no more respect for any other recording artist than i do for the late great luther allison  not sure if this was a postlife cashgrab by ruf records or if luther had hit rock bottom at the time of these recordings  none the less there is nothing very little anyway on this disc that resembles the early westside blues of luther or his massive return to the usa popularity  alligator label in the 1980s  there is one and a half decent blues cuts on here  a lot of stylejumping from funk to badliving in americajames brown to teppid ballads  the lyrics are clicheridden and the sound cheesy keyboards is outdated it is a major bummer as i have many great luther cds in my collection  this is not the way a blues legend wants to be remembered  save your money and start with his trio of 1980s alligator releases or a couple of his live cds  luther was a major live act who put every ounce of his heart and soul into every note he played on guitar and every word he sang on stage  check out his lastest cddvd from montreal recorded just weeks prior to his passing from cancer  rip luther you deserve beter than this|0
of all the christmas albums ive listened to over the years michael w smiths christmas remains my number one favoritei first picked up this album on cassette when i was a freshmen in college in minnesota back in 1989 amazon incorrectly lists that this came out in 1993 because i really enjoyed his previous album i 2 eye  i was excited when i saw this sitting in the storesi brought it back to the dorm room and popped it into the boom box remember those a light snowfall outside enhanced the enjoyment of this album each song compliments the others and all works together in a incredible 37 minute listening experiencethe instrumental first snowfall is forever locked into memory as a favorite as i listened to the track and watched the light snowfall outside as i now live in oklahoma snowfall is rare however if we do get even a few flakes in december i clear my schedule and enjoy the snowfall with this album playing in the backgroundall is well is another personal favorite it starts off the with single voice of a boy singing and eventually ends in the full choir i love how in later albums mws uses this same technique start with one voice or instrument and end the song with the full chorus and orchestraif you are still debating getting this cd go ahead and buy it or download the mp3s if you download the mp3s be sure to listen to them in order christmas hails from a time when all songs worked together and flowed into one long story make yourself some hot chocolate or if you are in the south turn down the ac and completely clear your schedule for the next 40 minutes and listen let the images of the world at peace on christmas eve work their magic and for a brief moment allow yourself to dream that all is well in this world|1
this is a 5 star album rock classical tones with a twisteach girl plays a different instrument awesome sound|1
the west side story songs are limited to four selections and the quartet does not delve deeply into any of them i have almost all of the brubeck albums recorded over brubecks career the quartet usually stretches out with excellent  improvisations but not the case here there are no liner notes and the members of the quartet are not even listedthe listing of the 9 tunes on the album are not even in correct sequence but quite helterskelterthis is an insult to the memory of the class act that was the dave brubeck quartet|0
this is a very truncated version of the soundtrack essentially the original 1963 record album because lps could hold only so much music different versions of the cues were used and much of the music is not here the complete score is available on amazon httpwwwamazoncomescapecompleteoriginalmotionpicturesoundtrackdpb004jo44t6refpdsxpgridpt00 which is a 3 cd set that also includes this original album|0
i do not have this soundtrack but if it is anything like the others availableit is not the originali would recommend picking up the the actual sega saturn game the very first and also the windows 95 pc xl gameif you want the real songs by cold storage in fact you can play the those directly in your cd playeror import them as mp3s in to itunesenjoy|0
after all the promise of the early releases of caravan bu2b and headlong flight the remaining tracks fall way way short the 3 tracks mentioned will all find their way one day to the complete compiliation of rush greats and stand very high among them but the other 9 are equal to 3 strikeouts in this inning of their career they just did not hit any nerve or stir any emotion and its especially dissappointing after coming off the masterpiece that snakes and arrows was|0
one of my favorite comedians a great act that you wont be embarrased to show to anyone on dvdall of his material is clean and hilarious i just got the new one too but havent watched it yet im looking forward to it|1

had these in cassette for my children thirty some years ago  wanted these also bought raffis box of sunshine wonderful tapes for my granddaughter  enjoyed them then and were enjoying them now  highly recommend these cds  you wont regret buying them|1
well my main motivation for buying this cd was the fact that tureck was playing something other than bach  so unfortunately i bought the recording  the bachbusoni chaconne is barely tolerable for several reasons but the most aggravating is her ultra slow tempi and the fact that her hands arent large enough for the stretches in the piece make it worse  however brahms handel variations receive a most unfavorable reading by ms tureck  her tempo is incomprehensibly slow and im fairly certain she pushes the halfhour mark and the fugue is unbearable  her tone is harsh and i was disappointed to hear such a great artist play so sloppily and unmusicallyemmanuel ax offers a favorable yet slightly sterilesounding version but i have 2 personal favorites for this monumental work egon petri on pearl though the sound is bad the interpretation and pianism are breathtaking and van cliburn has the perfect brahms sound i also highly recommend his recording of the concertihowever their are some wonderful bach encores that show tureck at her absolute best and i would even go as far to say they make the cd worthy buying but that would be a lie  true her bach is lovely but it in no way compensates for her incoherent readings of the bachbusoni and brahms|0
i have owned this cd for about 8 months  i play it nearly every morning to begin my day with meditation it definitely makes a difference in my day|1
like most people reviewing this release i have been a long time fan of rush ive seen them live more times then i can count and have been a fan since the 70s my first rush concert was after all the worlds a stage came out so ive been a fan for a looong time anyway when this first came out i really liked it for a couple weeks and then it sort of dropped off my radar then i read the book all of a sudden i had to relisten and when i did and the concept fell into place this became one of my favorite rush releases of the modern era of rush no its not hemispheres but what is i think reading the book should be required before listening because as stand alone songs there will not be a lot to grasp onto lyric wise and i think this is where some of the 1 and 2 star reviews come from but read the book and relisten and you can follow the concept from song 1 it is now in constant rotation on my ipod and i truly love this album people that say they phoned this in are not listening to the same recording i am the riffs on the anarchist or seven cities call back to a past day in rushs history and this is the first album in a long time that had me wanting to pick up my guitar and learn the songs and to the people the say geddy is not singing with emotion really have they listened to the gardenwait i changed my mind this is not one of my favorites from modern era rush but from any rush|1
i and my daughter enjoy raffis music so much  you cant go wrong here  3 great cds  catchy not annoying songs that broaden childrens horizons|1

i like a lot of deuters music generally buddha nature nirvana road wind and mountain earth blue land of enchantment garden of the beloved ecstasy nada himalaya and so on all of which are pervaded with love and warmth d is just ugly sound its negative unconscious full of harsh uglinessthis should never be mistaken for a representation of deuters other albums meeting osho seems to have turned him around since from what i can gather the albums made during and after meeting him and absorbing his presence and ways express a lot of love joy bliss warmth happiness which d clearly lacks|0
i must make it clear at the outset that i dont possess this cd in this edition  i do however possess adifferent edition and there is also themenus and music edition which as i write is considerably cheaper than this onethe musicto clarify the primary artist here is the guitarist marc teicholz who is joined on cello by ms oconnor for pieces 1113  la vida breve apparently doubletracked is in fact the famous spanish dance no 1 not the entire opera  the mompou piece is from the suite compostelana recorded in its entirety by segovia and others  there is only one catalan folk songmy attention was initially drawn to this cd by its inclusion of halffters danza de la pastora i saw narciso yepes play this many years ago but he never recorded it and ive been searching for a good recording ever sincemarc teicholz is a winner of the guitar foundation of america competition and this album show clearly why  my wife mdash a musician but not particularly a fan of classical guitar although exposed to it by long association with me mdash exclaimed my god hes terrific hes got everythingand indeed he has  the pieces here range from fairly easy to fiendish but mr teicholz negotiates them all with equally effortless authority and beautiful tone  the wellknown asturias which some prefer to start quietly and build up is treated here more like a flamenco piece which indeed it may be regarded as being based on a granadina the notorious big chord which causes so many guitarists to falter is played with rocksolid rhythm as is everything else  likewise i have never heard the turina pieces played with greater command but lyricism seems to come just as easily as in the beautiful capricho catalaacutenthere are many young guitarists today with excellent technique  what separates mr teicholz from the herd is his musicality  his version of danza de la pastora is much more exciting than that ofmessrs parkening  brandon even though they have twice as many guitars furthermore he observes all the repeats which they do not  in fact this piece alone would be worth the price of the cd to mebut even ignoring that this is a thoroughly worthwhile album even if you already have some of the familiar pieces the guitar and cello transcriptions work extremely well all the music is accessible to the average listener and the recording is excellentthe total time is 5057|1
mikloacutes roacutezsas score to the classic movie el cid is indeed one of the greatest film scores of the 1960s the music is epic and truly made for widescreen with its sweeping romantic themes grandious fanfares and great orchestral buildups i can definitely recommend it to anyone interested in largescale romantic film scores but unfortunately not in this version recorded with the new zealand symphony orchestra conducted by james sedares the orchestra under sedares plays well which is why i rate this cd 2 stars instead of only 1 which it would deserve based on the poor production and gives an overall perfectly acceptable performancebut what drags this recording down is the dreadful production it is a telling sign that the pipe organ solo of the final and in the movie very important climax has been replaced by a synthesized sound from what could be a cheap 300 keyboard unfortunately this is not an exaggeration in any way  the majestically perceived by roacutezsa organ solo here falls completely apart because it sounds tame uttermost fake and very cheap which of course is exactly what it is the producers should be ashamed to murder rozsas music and an otherwise decent recording like this for shame it truly puzzles me how other reviewers seems not to have noticed or have decided to disregard this quite glaring and major problemthat alone ruins the experience of the cd and clearly demonstrates that this is not a project made with enough musical integrity it should never have been released like this im sure rozsa would have not approved had he lived to hear the final bad result this production soils his memory which is undeserved but since the organ part seems to have been added after the orchestral recordings the recorded material can hopefully be saved and at some point rereleased in a proper wayfor now i strongly recommend not buying this version of the el cid score|0
this is a must to have on vinyl pink floyd are one of the most respected bands and this pressing is just that it is well worth the extra money for the pressing|1
funny i liked it just as much as he rated g good clean fun|1
i was thinking i was going to get something that was missing from the first remaster of some years ago but what i hear is the same old sound that sounds no different from the first cd remaster of 1987 and then again in the box set from 2006 how many times will they remaster this cd cant they get it right the first time the short video that comes with it may or may not make it worth buying i leave that up to the collector personally i wouldnt recommend it|0
this show is amazing  the sets costumes dance and characters are wonderfully penned and created  however the cd leaves much to be desired  george hearn doesnt have enough gay to make a believable drag performer  his version of i am what i am while true to the character is not as beautiful or faltering as albin should be  if you live in nyc or are going i reccomend the current revival which needs a cd as it is fantastic  however i am sad that this is currently the only documenation of this show|0
the work as presented by the oslo phiharmonic orchestra jansons conducting falls far short of this listeners expectations it hardly represents the passion one believes tchikovsky felt and intended that makes the same work exciting and unforgetable as played by the national symphony orchestra of russia i regret that cd was not available|0
i bought this cd because per lucia is one of the songs of my life but not this version of per lucia i liked the original version  more melodious and less jazz  that fogli taken at the eurofestival in 1983  but i dont know how to get it|0
stay away from his cheap videocassette copy thats right this is a plain video cassette copied onto a dvd it looks bad and the sound is garbage a new cheap  copy is coming its gotta be better than this garbage|0
remixed and remastered before listening to this cd i anticipated that this was not only remastered for better sound quality but also remixed for a new verison of biggies ready to die cd a must buy for any true hip hop fan but after listening to this cd i came to find that it was the same cd as the orignal except a few bonus tracks literally 3 new tracks dont waste my time if you already own ready to die  dont waste the money for this sad excuse of a remix cdif you are a true big fan these tracks are ones youve already heard and not worth 14 more dollarsshame on you bad boy recordsbig just rolled over in his grave|0
the piano tracks on this cd are a little syrupy such as the lullaby melodies at various intervals  i was looking for music that i could read to and fall asleep to that allows you to relax in a semimeditative state and i find that this cd is too contrived in its choice of melodies and tone varieties if you are looking for light piano music this cd is fine but if you are looking for soothing meditation sounds this is not the cd for you|0
you got a new girl friendbut i still love you|0
wow this album is excellent after making a good album this means war petra makes even a better album they continued the same great rock style  comparing to bands like def leppard the bands plays well the singers sings perfectly the songs rock the message is important and greatwhat else there should be i think this is one of the best christian rock albums ever although theres two ballads first love and homeless few which a little bit makes this album peaceful  but still  all fired up mine field stand in the gap and others rock so hard that you cannot be without loving this album this album should be owned by every christian rock fanstars somebodys gonna praise his name all fired up hit you where you live|1
as a multimedia experience it is a classic if you put the album film and concert together it comes out to an amazing project that few bands have achieved at the same level before or sincethere is a lot of great music here comfortably numb brought down the house at live 8 run like hell hey you and another brick in the wall ii are radio classics however this also caused the friction within the band and was undoubtably the beginning of the end of pf with roger watersmy opinion is that dark side of the moon wish you were here and animals was pink floyd the wall final cut and pros and cons of hitchhiking were rogers solo projects but david gilmours guitar playing and singing on young lust and in other parts makes the wall anything but a solo projectthe wall represents a lot of things here the wall that comes up in bad relationships the wall between reality and delusion and having it become seemingly insurmountable rogers seeds of his own father dying in wartime british education funny that someone who would write we dont need no education was a university student and would have to answer to his own kids about that line overbearing parents his marriage and watching syd barrett disintegrate before him as well as the wall he had between himself and the fans when they hit the big time created this project putting them all into a character named pink have a cigar welcome to the machine and us and them in a way were the preface to the wall to me this is a very british album as much as anything the kinks did a decade earlier but has universal appealtowards the end pink has to face the fears that the wall built up but unfortunately the wall built up between the band|1
pink floyds the wall is a true masterpiece of rock music the album is truly thought provoking unwinding a tale over two amazing cdsabout a week ago i was in a bit of a drout for something to listen to as i searched threw my cd collection for an album with some good guitar on it  without being hendrix  i found the wall ive always been a bit of a pink floyd fan mainly because these guys could really make good rock anyone will tell you that this album is a classic and i really love it i can jam to this right here anytimethe album itself is about the mind of a troubled rockstar who deals with the death of his father controlling mother opressive school teachers broken marriage his music his fans and his bout with drugs as the numerous problems and demons that haunt himi still get excited when i come to listen to this and everytime i never want it to end every song on this album is classic  theres not one i dont like my favourite songs would have to be another brick in the wall parts 1  2 but every song on this album makes up the story but the ones that have the deepest meanings are goodbye blue sky mother comfortably numb and the trialjust because every song on the album contributes to the story that doesnt mean that if you listen to any song it wont make sense i regualy just pop in the wall and listen to another brick in the wall pt 2so from me the wall gets five stars and rightly so as it is one of the best written well played and complex rock albums ever you dont even have to be heavy into rock  im not  to enjoy this masterpiece its worth having not just for the history not just for the outstanding guitar work but for the absolute listening experience it is this is recommended 5 stars|1

i heard this at a lesbian discotheque in berlin it made me gag that i was even there i was getting out of a bad blizzard and i nearly puked because these songs were so badabba singer annifrid lyngstad aka frida dumb name does the job of messing up this album theres nothing noteworthy or even interesting its swedish slop served up in 80s decorif you stuck your hand in a bin of 70s era gay discotheque music youd have a better chance of finding something at least passablei know theres something going on is supposed to be the great song here but its so horribly annoying as to produce a monotone buzzing in your ear|0
unlike slashs first postvelvet revolver solo album which featured a myriad of guest singers and musicians apocalyptic love sees the former gunner reteam with the nucleus of his touring band  vocalist myles kennedy alter bridge bassist todd kerns sin city sinners and drummer brent fitz union  for an absolutely rockin 13song soundtrack to the summer of 2012 first single youre a lie continues to dominate north american radio airwaves and with good reason its so damn catchy hands down second single should be no more heroes another ridiculously infectious tune the key to both of these gems lies in their irresistible hooks and singalong choruses admittedly some of the other cuts such hard  fast and standing in the sun  which bears a slight resemblance to guns n roses locomotive with its rumbling riff  are growers requiring a few listens before they too rattle around your brain long after the discs done midway through anastasia offers a beautiful acoustic intro followed by a superb picking pattern while not for me takes things down a notch allowing myles to show his tender side throughout the entire album slash solos effortlessly and admirably proving he truly is a guitar icon without parallel the deluxe edition of apocalyptic love includes two bonus tracks carolina which sees slash hit the talk box and crazy life guaranteed to have your foot stompin before you know it also included in the deluxe version is a free tshirt offer and bonus 30minute dvd comprised of interviews with each of the four guys providing insight into the creative process as well as footage of the band rehearsing and  recording a handful of songs live off the floor at barefoot studios in hollywood ca pity the lyrics werent included in the booklet but its hard to imagine apocalyptic love sounding any better as the only album to top it thus far this year is van halens a different kind of truth|1
i applaud the larchibudelli ensembles efforts to bring out more clearly the polyphonic interplay of instruments in these sextets  its very much in synch with brahms way of thinking about music  and their brisk tempi  both are admirable ideasthe problem is that these performances are inexpressive and sometimes plainly unmusical  im laying this squarely at the feet of the 1st violinist in the ensemble who i believe is vera beths  beths presumably is a violinist who plays everything pretty much at the same dynamic and projects little expressivity which is a killer for such beautiful and heartfelt music as these sextets  the opening violin melody in the 1st movement of op 36 is simply mangled  this performance doesnt make sense of it  and the dramatic opening movement of op 18 is played with a metronomic unvarying beat that completely fails to bring out drama that is so important to it  the accents sforzandi are underplayed and underemphasized  they make the allegro into a kind of saccharine muzaki want to praise anner bylsma the star 1st cellist in this ensemble  his playing is very powerful and full of the emotion that seems lacking in manyh other passages  as a result the performance of the andante variations from the op 18 set  the most famous track on this disc  is exciting and sweeping because the 1st cello has such a big role in itto better understand why this cd was just so disappointing i went back to the old amadeus quartet version on dg that i have known for years  the amadues recording is pretty good but not great or even very good but the musicians make sense of the op 36 opening  its as if larchibudelli in their performance were trying to speak a foreign language  and turn it into a memorable themeso an unsatisfactory recording  especially stay away if you are unfamiliar with this music|0

this album comes off as a halfbaked effort at pop credibilityi was sorely dissapointed when i heard this album for the first time i have loved every bit of phils work but this album really frustrates me i cannot recommend it for a fan starting out their keaggy library hes done far superior work before and since|0
what a great album  sammy is 65 and still sounds amazing  i didnt think they could top the first album but i think they did with this one  favorite tunes are last temptation lighten up big foot and somethings goin wrong  got to seem them live in may in minnesota and it was a great show they sounded extremely solid go buy the album  it will make you very happy|1
i was disappointed to find the song the dark island was not it when i listened to the sample the sample said it was paradise island  i was disappointed that the titles given were not the same when listening to the samples|0
when this recording of faust first appeared fanfare panned it sure its well sung but the performance drags there are two modern recordings from emi which are much livelier one is conducted by george pretre and has the advantage of placido domingo mirella freni and nicolas ghiaurov in the roles of faust marguerite and mephistopheles the other is conducted by michel plasson and has richard leech cheryl studer and jose van dam i prefer the plasson recording because it has thomas hampson as valentin if there is anyone who can steal the show even in a small role it is hampson the plasson also includes an extensive appendix which includes all of the music which is usually deleted from performances not necessarily because it is weak but because the opera is just too longi also prefer the plasson because the performances are more believable domingo does have that big unforgetable voice but leech does sound like a guy who is in over his head someone who is mere fish food for the devil the same goes for freni i have seen her numerous times at the met and she does inhabit a role but i can really believe studer is heading for a bad endas for the role of mephistopheles it is a question of whether you prefer a true bass like ghiaurov or a a bassbaritone like van dam both sound unctuous and evil but in this opera i like to have a bassbaritone the sound of a bassbaritone seems to fit this music betterno matter which emi recording you chose you cant go wrong either one should suit your tastes|0
this cd is bad the only song on it thats ne good at all is obladioblada i love that song obladioblada has touched peeps lifes and theyve spoken obladioblada is the best work of art by anyone or anything that includes  woodchucks lets get reel the beatles never did ne thing good|0
this review is for the 1998 metal blade release of this album unfortunately i bought this version it is awful the sound quality is so bad that it makes the album unlistenable im pretty familiar with nwobhm so im used to less than stellar sound quality but this is just unacceptable hilariously the cd case says it was remastered i would really like to know how they remastered this one it sure sounds like they just took the original vinyl and held a handheld cassette tape recorder up to it the main problem is with the rhythm guitar parts they are fuzzy distorted screechy and are so high in the mix they all just sound so bad the reason im giving it two stars instead of one is because the bonus tracks sound perfectly finethere is three of them so at least you get the axe crazy single that was released before power games the a and b side from that single are cool songs and again they sound great here if it wasnt for the bonus tracks this one would be added to my frisbee collection if someone could recommend me the best cd pressing of this album please do because the songs from power games seem like they might be cool without terrible productionps i hate this because it makes me even more nervous to buy cds online before hearing the specific pressing im going to get metal blade is a huge well respected label and this is just an ameteur release|0
i dont personally own this soundtrack however awhile ago i was able to actually find the when johnny comes marching home score from this movie and i believe it is the correct version sadly it is not listed on the soundtrack which would have been the only reason i would have bought this|0
i like it its funky blues every tune has a little something that wants you to listen all the way through this cd i did not expect luther snake georgia boy guitar junior johnson to cut his axe so sharp and distinct its good toetapping blues and the brass band blends in well|1
this is easily one of the best rush albums ever they really took their genius of their songwriting and stepped it up higher than ever before 1000 recommended to anybody who actually believes in using real instruments to make music cheers|1
the only good thing about this album is that they hadnt became pretentious show offs yet as always with the beatles the songs are much too slick and make for good elevator music the only good thing that this  album did was that it made it easier for other great british rock bands  like the stones to get accepted in the states if you want to hear a decent  dubut album listen to the rolling stones first album at least they put  some heart in their music|0
yes this cd is one of the best i have ever listened to it is and shall continue to remain a timeless classic and i urge anyone who likes pink floyd to listen to or even buy it|1
i thought i would love this recording but it is slow and the voices do not blend at all  vickers is just not up to this and has a hard time blending with the other more lyrical voices  the tempo is boring  the recording is not very clear either  caballe is good but not at her best  i saw a performance of her in the 1980s doing this and it was incredible  but there was no energy in this  i have several recordings and this one is my least favorite  see the original price ellias bjorling and ellias recording  now that is perfection|0
then i am an authentic blonde  it is slaviceastern european folk music in the style of esma respenova could even be her  but it is not suitable for belly dance  it doesnt even have remotely suitable rhythms or musical  patterns the sad thing is this set keeps reappearing every so often like  an elvis siting to snooker some poor beginning student who could only be  discouraged in trying to dance to this  i recommend checking out any of  the hossam ramsy and the like for what is real and authentic in the world  of middle eastern dance  this cd is clearly a case of false advertising  and intentional misrepresentation to fool the uninformed|0
this is a review on the vinyl version i received  it arrived in excellent condition  the second lp was slightly warped but really was not an issue  the artwork is so much better than on the cd probably because it is larger  i had great enjoyment playing this on my turntable  rush is great vinyl rush is even greater|1
not what i thought it would be according the the jacket  very limp and not a gypsy verve that would attend with a cd title like that|0
this was without any doubt one of the best pink floyd albums featuring the great comfortably numbvery highly recommended to all rock music fans|1
there is a goodquality dvd of melody nelson in existence somewhere in the world france for sure its not in this set the dvd is a documentary the company that supplies this set must have decided that we foolish americans cannot see gainsbourgs masterpiece|0
yes theyre all good but i think inside is his best  that being said i dont own standing eight which is usually considered his bestto start off with the weak parts honestly i think the only weak song is chameleon blues which is one of his novelty type songs  its good but it wears thin after awhile  all the other songs are amazing especially the title track everybody warned me offwhite man from out of town robert johnson hang me oh hang me and casey illinois  the rest are also fantastic but the ones i just listed are some of my favorite songs  man from out of town and everybody warned me are probably two of my favorite songs at the momentgamblers blues has a young ellis paul singing backup which is great and hang me oh hang me is a duet with greg brown  for a song everyone has done they do a great job making it new and fresh  a great place to start your bill morrissey collection  if he would only tour more often|1
i wish i could have read my review before reading all these hippies talk about how great this album is i was born in the mid 70s and this album means nothing to me except something that maybe my parents older siblings would like to listen to because it brings back memories of their childhood maybe i havent listened to the lyrics as closely as i should have but the music is so damn annoying i cant get past that to listen to the lyrics hearts love flowers were a time of the past if you really like the musical hair then you will like this album|0
that lucille ball is a genius is undoubted who else would leave a secure contract at one studio to go to columbia pictures for a role in a single three stooges short who else could play low comedy and do a very  creditable role on a dramatic radio show it is a very good thing that  radio spirits has chosen to release a collection of 10 radio shows that  starred or had as a guest star the redhead herselfltthe best of  old time radio starring lucille ballgt is available on 6 cds or 4  cassettes i have both formats i find it very pleasant hearing the tapes  in my car and the cds for my classes or easier access to a program i want  to hear again in this collection we have 4 episodes of my favorite  husband 2 of suspense and one each of lux radio  theatre fancy pants the abbott  costello  show the lux radio theatre the dark  corner the gulf screen guild theatre tight  shoespersonally i wish they did not have quite so many of  my favorite husband when the single radio episode of  i  love lucy is available and is indeed included in another radio  spirits collection however i do thank the publishers for avoiding undue  duplication in their huge inventory of setsit is amazing  how well she handles her dramatic assignments and then can turn around to  create comic cartoon characters as she does at the end of each  husband episode to plug the sponsors product and while bob  hope is allowed all sorts of anachronistic references in the fancy  pants feature lucy plays her part straight and to far better  effectas is always true with radio spirit sets the accompanying  booklet is a treasure of information and excellent photos first about  lucys career and then about each individual show|1
i thought this product was the thank you cd which has several songs  but instead it was a sound track for the song thank you|0
my favorite line in the whole album so the wall many consider it pink floyds magnum opus but just as many consider it their worst album ill admit that for two years i was one of the ones that believed the wall to be a bad album my brother praised it but i did not get ittwo years after first hearing it i am shocked by how good it is i think i just needed to mature musically in order to understand it the second half is pretty much perfect while the first is a little slow cant recommend this album enough do yourself a favor and hear it now|1
you may have heard the redneck banter of my brother and cousin dufus it is for this reason and the excessive silliness of this album that i must deliver a tirade the likes of which have never before been seen on the  internet  just look at the cover of the album  what the hell have they  got all over their faces hmm  they need to clean up their act thats  what  look at the song titles  magical mystery tour pah do they think  everyone who listens to music is a teenybopper who can be wooed by pretty  colors  pah again  dufus is a disgrace to the radwick family name  i  hope no one sees his horrendus review of help|0
this cd is not one of my favorites because it has a large mix of tracks that are already on other cds it also has some very raw and authentic sounds not your typcial modern native american although there is some of that too the nice effect is how each song runs into each other as if the whole cd is one continuous track there are songs on this cd that consist totally of nature sounds more for therapy or relaxation if that is what you are looking for and then there is bruleacute which is awesome but youre better off just buying a bruleacute album and enjoyig all of their singles|0
i have been a rush fan since my teen years in the 80s  while always a huge fan id be lying if i said the albums of the last several years have been up to rush standards  several great songs but no great rush albums  for me a great rush album is one that i can not wait to listen to over and over again loving every song  clockwork angels is just that  its their best offering since signals  every single song on this album is a home run and the lyrics are some of neils best  this album is a true masterpiece and deserves consideration for album of the year  they just dont make them like this anymore|1
this music was recorded between 1940 and 1946 it says so on the cover but its illegible in the tiny little picture amazon gives you the recordings are monaural and very noisy they sound very much like they were recorded in 1940 so while the cd has historical and educational value its not much of a pleasure to listen to the cbs masterworks stravinsky conducts stravinsky series is a much better deal|0
advertised was a picture of the music album i wantedwhen l got the product it was different music all together with the same name but different album cover there was no track list so i couldnt identify the album by the song i wanted i did get my money back the apology i got was sorry for the inconvenience but all the other info was there who ever wrote that apology was either misinformed or just plain ignorant there was no tracklisthopefully theyve mended errors by now the money wasnt much but time and expectations were|0
this side up represents a slight departure for bridger jones from their earlier style their current album is more like smooth jazz bringing in various collaborators and their techno influence although each piece is written by bridgerjones themselves  at first listen i liked the cheerful pieces more eg on my way but after a few times i definitely started getting into the mood pieces like words unspoken  overall a great cd for those moments when youre in the mood|1
after all these years this album reminds me of gene simmonss comment about rush the basic gist of it anyway no other band sounds like that its rushmuch like star wars fans if youre a rush fan youre probably going to dig what they put out to some degree simply because theyre rushwhile geddys voice doesnt soar like it did way back when they create the vocals around this reality and even after theyve been at it for almost 40 years they can still play amazinglyi love how theyve even gotten a bit heavier as theyve aged but not every track here is heavy in typical neil fashion though every track is considered and powerful in its messagethe early released tracks caravan and bu2b are easy to like instantly and sounded amazing live on the time machine tour by the way other songs require more attention and time the sign of a great albumand the entire album download us available for 599 id have bought it regardless of the price but a price this low is a nice bonus|1
i love their concept albums from the 70s so getting another one now is a pleasant surprise its typical rush courage to do whatever the bleep they want love it|1
let me preface by admitting a low expertise on french virtuosic is that a word repertoire that said i am an organist and love pipe organ music i had high hopes for this collection but even after several listens i could not grow to like it the organist todd wilson did great so far as i could tell there remained two problems the organ and the music selectionthe liner notes give high praise to the holtkamp organ at the u of alabama sonically the organ seems to be in the universitys gymnasium theres such a short reverb not suited to this rather large instrument secondly its so perfectly tuned as to be almost dead sounding the recording seems somewhat monaural except for some of the quiet parts the power chords are a wall of sound with bottomy bombardes and lacking in brilliance and life a good pipe organ at its loudest should sound happy to be alivethe selections are as with any classical music a matter of taste being a big fan of jongens symphony concertante and his piano works i found this piece disappointing im not familiar with any of the other works on this cd save the dupre here it was muffled in the beginning and the climax was simply loud not glorious ive heard much nicer versions i couldnt stand the demessiex rorate coeli movement it was so sappy and annoying i wanted to scratch my eyes out the other movements are simply amateurish in their composition the remaining pieces are mostly forgettable though widors cantilene movement is actually quite prettysorry i cant be more positive delos usually does a great job i recommend their durufle collection also featuring mr wilson enthusiastically but this virtuosic collection disappoints|0
ms mutter recorded beethovens violin concerto over twenty years ago when still a teenager and for some reason she has never replaced this early recording she performs with an astudent proficiency that never adds up to an interpretation skillfully negotiating each technical challenge in a commendable but wholly unexciting fashion time for a new version id saybut considering how poorly she handles beethovens sonatas in her recent multidisc release one wonders if age has brought mastery or degeneration|0
i understand the point of remix albums as the original artists or other artistsproducersetc want to make their previously released songs sound different  the issue is that bushs music does not flow very well when it is remixed to electronic music  bushs music would have come off better with industrial remixes  instead we get bland 700 remixes of songs that sound like they came from rave clubs  people should turn elsewhere for a good remix album  rob zombies american music made to strip by is much better|0
considering that this was a birthday gift for my rush loving hubby i can only tell you that he was excited to receive this album|1
where did this album come from this album is astounding a musical lyrical and conceptual tour de force rush has shown that they just get better with age clockwork angels reminds me of 2112 in that both are stories about a person in a place experiencing things but while 2112 was the work of a supertalented but young band clockwork angels is the work of mature musical masters comfortable with each other longtime masters of their respective instruments and willing to do exactly what they want this album is beautiful vibrant musically complex naturally but thematically complex as well the soft beginning to bu2b beautifully captures the mood of a distant steampunk land i dont know where this album came from snakes and arrows wasnt my favorite rush album and then they come out with this which is just incredibleive always loved rush they are probably overall my favorite band and this album is easily one of their best|1
i owned this cd from day one when the artist was still known as dennis quinn  the cd was then just released and i heard it was playing inside a new age store in old town sacramento  i offered to buy the cd and the owner was happy that i appreciated her taste of music she had only charged me the listed price but my secret at that time was i would pay any price for this open secret  up to now its still my top new age cd and definitely is one of the music collection ill keep for the rest of life  i found that other productions from the same artist now known as asha is somewhat disappointing  open secret is one of the best new age cd and is now became lost secret  it is one of the fortunate things in my life to own this secret i am myself also a musician play two instruments and a member of an orchestra i have such great admiration to this artist i just feel that i owe it to the artist all new age music lovers and myself to reveal this lost open secret|1
i bought this expensive album because i really liked the wall video but this album just doesnt sound good to me even though i have  excellent audio equipment and all the songs other than the was just suck to me it is just a bunch of noise did not get the expected great high fidelity i was expectingi have decided to add the following to all my reviewsbeware some reviewers will trash a product for no reason simply because they are paid to do so or because they sell competitive products other reviewers will give products  that they have never seen and never used  glowing 5 star ratings  for a fee  some honest reviewers do not understand what a product is for or how to use it and will trash a product simply because they are just plain dumb and the biggest of companies have been fined for hiring an army of reviewers to review their products|0
a great album from the greatest band of this or any generation  pink floyds epic double disc masterpiece is a dark collection of brilliance  the only problem i do encounter with this album is that it is often dubbed roger waters masterpiece hear me out im not trying to take anything away from the legend that is waters but this album is in my opinion david gilmours best work  i find it frustrating at times that more of the credit goes towards waters  this rant is probably better suited on a floyd message board but i have to say that gilmours minor scales and incredible riffs made this album the ultimate masterpiece that it is  gilmour is a god among men and i just dont like seeing credit taken away from a place it is surely due  this album is the epitamy of classic rock and the perfect example of the possibilities of a concept album  waters truly was and still is a musical genius|1
this is pink floyd right here  this is their story to the fans their music is unparelled  it is simply genious the way they mix music and story together and it makes me wonder how anyone would find this cd boring  it is entrancing and is one of the greatest along with dark side of the moon wish you were here animals and of course others all of floyd is great  i love this album and if you want a great concept album this is where to turn|1
had this on a cassette which my player destroyed  cant go a year without it so now i have it on cd  beautiful |1
im really disappointed with this item the image on amazon makes it appear as if the artwork is the 12 sleeve but in fact capital went cheap and just stuck a sticker on cardboard the cardboard has radiohead reverse foil stamped but i bought the frakkin twelve inch for the large artwork that i thought it was packaged in so capital is just milking loyal fans and i fell for it however i wont be ordering the other singles that capital released as a part of this project|0
i was looking for more of the celticcolonial themes  most of this soundtrack is orchestral noise|0

this is for the 2009 stereo remaster  im sorry but the sound is horrible  i have thrilled to the 09 remasters of abbey road mmt ahdn and the beatles  so i was expecting to swoon when i put on rubber soul this evening  just the opposite folks  it is muddy  unlike the newfound clarity and sonority of pauls bass on those other 4 albums rubber soul sounds like the guitars and vocals are in front of me and the bass and drums are in the next room  even on michelle which is so clean youd think the bass would ring out the bass is the least discernible element of the song  and there is no bite at all to the drums on you wont see me  contrast this with something here comes the sun the end  penny lane the first half of i am the walrus revolution 1 dear prudence long long long and every track on ahdn where the bass resonates in your chest and the drums are punchy and exquisite giving the rest of the instruments a firm and distinct foundation to shineperhaps worst of all i had to strain to pick out the bass line on nowhere man  nowhere man  with its jaunty bass line rhythmically reminiscent of i saw her standing there  and the bass is awol on the 09 rubber soul remasterhow can this be  i know ive heard these bass lines more clearly than this  my lp has been packed deeply away in a box for 20 years and to my horror my 1987 cd is missing from its case and ive never downloaded it to itunes so i have no other reference but i know those bass lines in rubber soul have always sounded better than on the 09 remaster  havent they  if they can clean up the sonic muddle that was mmt they can certainly bring new life to rubber soul  but they didntone star for the sound  one star for the package|0
chickenfoots music keeps getting better and better been a long time since we had a real rock album come out  see you in chicago|1
i havent been around quite as long as some but ive been around a good bit longer than many others  i feel pretty well qualified to write this review in terms of tenure  my first rush show was in 1986  and there have been many since then  man that was a long time ago  lets put it this way  alex neil  geddy were a good bit younger that night in 1986 than i am now  the point is that ive been around these guys for quite a while  im not new on the scene and im intimately familiar with everything theyve ever done  pretty clearly i love this band  i love  respect their work on multiple levels for numerous reasons  i own everything theyve ever released  studio albums live albums solo records video releases literary offerings you name it  i have to say right out of the gate though that this record is different  specialfirst lets put this album into the proper perspective  these guys have been writing recording  performing for well over 35 years  that feat alone leaves most wouldbe competitors in the dust  consider though the following two additional factors  first with only one very old nearly insignificant and very asterisked exception this band has never undergone any significant changes in membership  on top of that theyve managed to survive a series of personal tragedies the likes of which have reduced the careers of many other artists to piles of fiery rubbleand remember this is their 20th studio effort  no small feat by any measure  suffice it to say that in reality theyve really got nothing left to prove  in a sense theyve done it all already  the groundbreaking early works the continuing explorations into new  uncharted territory the numerous live records showcasing the different eras the reinventions of the bands sound and the eventual returning to roots  theyve amassed one hell of a catalog  and theyve made a lot of very very good records  in point of fact i absolutely love the lions share of their workshaving said that make no mistake  im no fanboy  theyve made musical mistakes and ive never been afraid to call them out for what i perceived as disappointing efforts  truth be told theyve released exactly two studio records which i thought after a number of critical listens were fit for one place alone  the garbage can  yes i actually cast each of those cds into the trash  and i stand firmly behind those editorial judgments to this day  if you must know they were roll the bones  counterparts  just dreadful records the both of them  the point is that im perfectly capable and willing to be objective and critical when it comes to reviewing a given studio album even when its released by three guys ive idolized for decadestheir two most recent efforts  vapor trails and snakes  arrows  both of these records are good even very good  they each even offer moments of majesty but considered as complete works i dont believe that either one is necessarily great  such labels and terminology are subjective and relative to be sure however  i must be completely honest though and say that i very much wanted to like clockwork angels much more than i wound up liking either one of those releases  those two records though for good or ill had a lot to do with the preparation and adjustment of my expectations for this newest album  i was optimistic but at first perhaps cautiously so  as time went on however and i began to hear more of the rumors and speculation surrounding the forthcoming record i began to get a very good  funny feeling about it in my gut  simply on an intuitive level based upon rumor and conjecture as well as a number of insightful  revealing comments on the writing  recording of the album from the guys themselves  my gut ended up telling that me that this was going to be one for the books so to speak  i had a feeling for a long time that it was going to be special and now i believe that i was very much correctand without sounding like a complete  total sycophantic fanboy id like to say that this newest album this landmark 20th studio recording is quite simply phenomenal  it really is a fantastic record  quite possibly a 5outof5  full marks as it were  its this good on multiple levels for a variety of reasons  ill start by saying that the scale  scope of this album is grander than and quite unlike anything theyve done before  ever  yes theyve dabbled in the concept album genre before yielding boundarypushing and genredefining efforts such as 2112 and hemispheres  both of which by the way i absolutely love  but all their concept efforts have heretofore been relegated to just one side of a twosided record  a 50 proposition at best if you will  not so with this new monsterthis record is a continuous contiguous coherent concept piece from top to bottom beginning to end  and truth be told its not simply a concept piece its a story  which makes it all the more wonderfully accessible and meaningful because while not everyone will identify with a given concept everyone can pick up on a story  and its not just a story but a biography a lifes journey if you will  its a tale to which i immediately began to relate on a personal intellectual philosophical emotional  spiritual level  and while ive never gallivanted across an alchemical steampunk fantasy land ive absolutely been down the roads this guys traveling and ive experienced many of the things hes relating  expressing  yes ive always made connections to much of the music ive grown to love but once again this one is different  special  certainly i love tommy and the wall but i dont connect or identify with either of them on such a personal and emotional level  but ive made that connection with this guy on this record  and it happened nearly immediately  i must say that for me this is one of the most unique  remarkable aspects of this amazing albumnext on the list is the musicianship  technical proficiency they bring to the table  i dont wish to belabor a subject thats been hammered home so many times by so many other people in so many other reviews  so im not going to make a big fuss over musicianship  performance levels here  as was said earlier albeit in a different context these guys have nothing left to prove  suffice it to say that each of them is generally regarded as a virtuoso in his own right and rightly so  from a technical standpoint theyve always brought the heat and they sure dont disappoint in this case  but this is nearly a given before we begin  with these guys ability  proficiency are never at issue  i knew i didnt have to worry about these elements as critical  fundamental as they are to the musical foundation necessary for a successful record of any kind  i on the other hand was much more concerned with lyrical  thematic content the caliber of songwriting production value and finally spontaneity or the xfactor as well discuss much more laterfrom a strict songwriting standpoint i dont believe weve seen anything nearly this strong from these guys in quite a number of years  ill admit that about two weeks into it now theres still one track about which im not entirely sure but for the most part this record is about as strong a body of songwriting as theyve ever offered  and i know  thats saying a hell of a lot  trust me its that good  the desired riffs  hooks are all there in this case  the songs are relatively accessible even upon the first listen but are obviously multifaceted and filled with everlasting valuenext subject on the report card is production value  and god dammit not enough emphasis is placed on this area in todays world  with all the wonders digital technology continues to give us it seems as though we might actually be regressing in terms of musical production value lately  most things these days sound as though theyve been recorded to sound as processed  artificial as possible  as if that sort of sonic quality is actually the goal  you know exactly what im talking about  the loudness war  the songs have no headroom theres no air space no breathing room between the notes  all the sounds are pressed up against each other resulting in a sound thats as dynamic  and organic as latex or formica  i dont know about you but that stuff is enough to give me a headache  and you know what  ironically theres a relatively recent rush record that strikes me as being a particularly nasty offender  vapor trails  metallicas death magnetic is another infamous example of this total lack of sonic integrity  im not a musical engineer so i admit that i am not in command of the proper terminology or nomenclature but there are moments on those records that make me feel as though i cant breathe and that my ears are cracking up  sounds become needlessly distorted at high levels resulting in an insufferable hiss  its just intolerable  and while i expect it from the next numetal johnnycomelately i most certainly do not expect it or accept it from these three guys  theres just no excusethey know better and with clockwork angels they did better  god help me im not exactly sure of what happened but i believe its got something to do with the producer they first worked with on snakes  arrows and ultimately retained for this record  suffice it to say that this guy knows what the hell hes doing in a studio with regard to sound quality  sonic integrity  because this record absolutely shines  it gleams  it literally leaps out of my klipsch towers and sony studio monitor headphones  theres a crystal clarity a shimmering brightness and an almost golden quality to this entire record that must be experienced to be appreciated  it simply sounds wonderful even at blistering levelsand now we get down to the really subjective hardtodefine qualities that make the record the real gem that it is  for perhaps the very first time these guys let themselves go just a little bit  theyve finally loosened the reins ever so slightly in terms of their approach to their instruments and the musical dynamic existing between the three of them  theyre normally bound by rigid musical structure and sometimes it can come off as sounding starched  stiff  almost too polished  this time they allow improvisation and feel to cast their magical shadows over everything thats going on  and the resulting sound produced by the three who become one is simply phenomenal  so organic so natural so relaxed so comfortable  and perhaps somewhat paradoxically so incredibly powerful  these three have actually got a mean groove going on here  theyre actually copping a jam and it sounds incredible  its obvious that they had fun recording  performing this material  to be sure this is something thats quite difficult to capture here in prose but when you hear it its immediately evident  unmistakablefinally theres an openness an honesty a sincerity that just exudes from this record thats quite hard to describe but once again immediately evident  audible on the semiconscious level  it has something to do with what i mentioned earlier in terms of the connection with the lyrical  thematic content  this material is coming straight from the heart  that was readily apparent to me upon the first listen the maiden voyage  again another amorphous  ethereal quality that came across the bandwidth without any effort whatsoever  hopefully you understand what it is that im driving at here  if not im sure the fog will lift during your first listen  have no fearall these last subjective  magical qualities converge into a gigantic xfactor thats very hard to put a finger on verbally and as such i may not have done it any justice here unfortunately  but ultimately its these elusive ethereal qualities that help to elevate this new album high above not just the works of other wouldbe imitators  competitors but above even much of their own work up to this point  theyve outdone themselves  after 35 years 19 other studio records and god knows how many shows theyve managed to create a record that is without question one of their finest efforts ever  some are saying that they believe it will also be their last  sadly i must admit that my gut has suggested the very same thing to me though i dont wish to believe it  lets all hope were wrongjudging from the quality of clockwork angels its painfully obvious that these guys are a very long way from running out of fuel  amazingly it seems as if theyre actually becoming better on each  every level as theyre getting older  simply incredible gentlemen  congratulations  youve really outdone yourselves with this one  cant wait to see you again soon and experience some of this magic in person|1

say what you like about pink floyd but they werent exactly a barrel of laughs were they  syd barrett took the humour with him when he exited in 1967 and in the space of just a year pink floyd turned from a whimsical pop group to the purveyor of torpid excursions in pofaced selfindulgence this actually works on meddle dark side of the moon and wish you were here but with wall it really gets a bit too much the themes of alienation insanity and helplesness casting the hapless listener into a whirlpool of misery and inward suffering already by track 2 its all 1984 with 30s fascist imagery transposed against a modern rock show scenario and the theme of school being bad is covered more than adequately covered by monster no 1 hit single another brick in the wall happiest days of our lives and tape loops with frenzied teachers screaming and other miscellaneous effects subtle it aint intense it is if youre in the right mood however the wall offers up some great moments musically this is a mixed bag fans of 70s floyd will not find much here to cheer about the reason why the wall has sold so many copies and has become a powerful brand in itself is perhaps that the concept is stronger than the music contained therein theres the hits of course the soaring comfortably numb remains a steadfast blissout after a pint or two with david gilmours voice complementing the music so well i quite like the trial bit at the end which is like a dickens nightmare resurrected as gilbert  sullivan great orchestration and was nonplussed to read bob ezrins name as cocomposer of said tune ive always associated bob ezrins name with the group kiss still no complaints  mothers a potent tune but is smothered by overly lush production and layered stack harmonies a far cry from animals thankfully were living in the cd age because the thought of having to get up and flip this chunk of black vinyl over four times is daunting to say the least to sum up a great idea with strong sentiments and moment of musical lucidity partially ruined by heavyhandedness and at times clumsy and unsubtle imagery|0
love slash and this cd doesnt disappoint one great riff after another very pleased with this purchase  i give it a b|1
this is pink floyd at there best this album has surpassed perfection the wall is truely the best ever and will remain a masterpiece forever i would have to say this is required buy for anyone who is a music fan|1
i received my sound track in a very timely manner but was extremely disappointed to realize that it only had one song on it i didnt pay much for it but still the description stated that it was the whole sound track so naturally that is what i was expecting i was unable to return it because i had already discarded the packaging and receipt totally ruined my day|0
i love raffi and so do my kinders this cd has so many great songs which the kids love to sing buy it|1
hellothis is not what i expected not now john is a clasic the rest of the tracks are just ok|0
a lot is made of how clean brians humour is but first and foremost is how funny he is  if i hadnt read all these reviews here i wouldnt have even noticed the absence of swears until long after i finished listening  the disc is hysterical that its also free of foul language is just icingi saw brian on dennis miller live the other night and thought he was really funny  miller mentioned that brians big with the 14 yearold crowd and that sparked my interest in checking him out  to my 35 yearold mind fourteen yearolds are good judges of humournext i read the reviews here and then went out and bought the disc  its better than i hoped really really funny  the whole act is great but by the time big family stuff reached its peak i was begging for mercy  i seriously was in so much pain from laughing i considered leaving the room my gut couldnt take anymore  all brians talk of activities staring at the sun sitting in mud building bike ramps in the street had me cracking up and just thinking about it again makes me smile  you know kevin  you know how his arm used to bend like this  it dont bend like that anymorebuy this cd you wont regret it  and getting to see brians act is even better his body language and doofy expressions add to the act  cant wait to play this album for friends|1

this is the only album i would never give up  it is full of lyrical earthy humorous and thrilling spiritual songs sung by ordinary yet extraordinay women filled with joy power and energy as pure as sunlight  one cannot hear this music without feeling empowered and uplifted  nothing too syrupy here  it is a mix of wholehearted fullblown yet sometimes tender songs that will move you from any black space you may be temporarily inhabiting into the fullness of your soul  you will be proud to be a woman  if you are not a woman you will want to be one  love threads its way through every song and it is guaranteed you will laugh cry and become still with the beauty and glory of yourself male or female  ive protected and treasured this album since it first came out in the 80s  no album has ever surpassed it for simple compelling uplift and connecting you to your heart and soul|1
cats has always inspired a mixed reactionsee some of the other reviews this cd has garneredwhen i first saw the show back in 1982 i felt it was a lot of hoopla over nothing oh the original set in the winter garden theatre was sight to behold the stage stretched out into the auditorium and the walls were decorated with junk yard trashscaled to a cats eye view ie 212 times its normal size to give us a cats perspective during the overture the cast of cats dashed about the audience flashing their bright eyesstarling some and amusing others soon they were all up stage singingjellicle songs for jellicle catsjellicle songs for jellicle catsjellicle songs for jellicle catsjellicle songs for jellicle catsjellicle songs for jellicle catsand i thought okwhats the pointi admired the dancing and the spectacle but when all was said and sung i could see no compelling reason for this show to exist some of the songs are quite catchy i prefer the american version of mungojerrie and rumpelteazer i rather like bustopher jones and the old gumbie cat but after a half hour it starts to get boring because its not about anything story hal prince was asked to direct the show and wondered what it was about was lloyd webber was trying to make some sort of political statement hal its about cats the composer explained exit hal prince by the time we get to the shows big aria memory so much tedium had set in that as beautiful as the song is and as well sung as it was i dreaded the endless applause fearing an encore would only keep us in the theatre longer happily the finale arrived and we are told finally what the point of this show is a cat is not a dog i lost three hours of my life to learn thatneither the original london cast nor the broadway cast album include the awful battle of the pekes and the pollicles though the number really has to be seen to be fully appreciated the london cast has elaine paige as grizabella while the american cd offers betty buckley the best bet is to go for the single cd of highlights from the us production you get all the best songs and none of the filler|0
this deluxe edition is record label price gouging at its worstjust about everyone who loves the movie and this movie soundtrack album has already bought the first pressing so to make the reissue more appealing a 2nd disc of bonus materials has been addeddont get suckered in by thisthe main disc repeats the one flaw from the original release in that the songs are still all jumbled and nowhere near the order they are heard in the film you would think that the label would have corrected this but they didntthe second disc is short about 40 minutes and just features alternate takes and remixes of the same songs  nothing new thereone star may seem a bit harshbear in mind i give the original release 4 stars|0
the vinyl pressing is defective and of a very poor quality there are too many scuffs scratches clicks and pops its really sad when you consider there are pressing plants in the world today devoted to producing superior quality vinyl records clearly emiapple for reasons unknown to me have chosen a pressing plant with quality control issues  i am very disappointed with the overall quality of the vinyl i can only hope emiapple may produce a second run of pressings and team up with a pressing plant devoted to quality control maybe someone like rti or mobile fidelity sound labs could take control of the pressingsin the world of beatles box sets many editions andor pressings have been produced down thru the years in my collection i happen to own 1 the 1978 parlophone beatles bc 13 blue box set and 2 the 1982 mobile fidelityemi  box set pressed by the victor company  in japan on virgin vinyl  if i were to put aside all questions comments criticisms andor debates regarding the mastering of the recordings and merely focus on the quality of the vinyl  well its easy  the 1982 vinyl pressings are clearly the gold standard  the 1978 pressings come in at second place and the new 2012 pressings are dead last again i can only hope emi apple might consider a second run of pressings with a manufacturer  devoted to superior audiophile quality|0
i am a certified rush geek and can safely say this is the best rush album since signals 1982  wow|1
rays voice was becoming ragged when these tracks were cut in 1976 it had a acquired a harshness at odds with the shivery whispers that were a large part of his style in the 50s complicating things are the bombastic 70s arrangements that only inspire johnnie to push harder in some cases with mediocre material like tie a yellow ribbon ick this will be a tough one for most contemporary listeners to slog through and will give a false impression of rays true talents to those not familiar with his best work|0
youll find this cd hilarious  be prepared for significant cheek pain  cant say enough great about this genius comic  its about time to see a comedian who isnt using smut to get people to laugh  thanks brian|1
how can a reviewer like scarlotti put down someone else while not reviewingthe cd but just offering a defense for this opportunistic and poor singerit would be nice to hear some of her music from the 1930s and 1940s to contrast the horrors on this cdshe does  not have versatility she just blares out everything at the same loud level she does not have subtlety why then is she underappreciated with a career that lasted so long why then is she remembered for her pathetic cover versions that turned rb into white bread dont blame lavern baker as she didnt yield much influence in the world of music or media georgia gibbs wasreally bad|0
i enjoyed the emi classics 2 cd set conducted by otto klemperer far more than this rather disappointing recording with james levine klemperers conducting is more subtle and expressive capturing far more detail and emotional depth in contrast levines conducting really makes the music feel always on  always going at full bore and therefore the music loses its power and the contrast between tragedy and heroic desperate bliss that wagners music embodies get the klemperer instead it actually brings real legitimacy to the orchestralonly performance|0
i just wanted to log yet another five star rating for this cd and every one of raffis cds in addition to the other reviewers it is not an exaggeration to say that raffi music makes me a better mother if i am cranky and put on some raffi music it cheers mommy and everyone else up as we sing along and are silly raffi reminds me that gentleness and silliness and love are still enduring and essential parts of childhood raffi please consider yourself welcome at my fantasy dinner party along with cynthia rylant george macdonald harry connick junior tommy depaola brennan manning and maya angelou what a fun party thanks raffi|1
almost a year ago i reviewed the very good african roots albumi also bought out a babylon what was a solid album but not as good as african roots i think warrior is a great follow up for the african roots album he worked again with the producer ryan moore and if you ask me he has to stick with this guy because he knows how roseand the music must sound like real roots reggae music and some tracks really let you think of his black uhuru period michael rose at his best|1
aj scudieres medicaltechno sciencefiction thriller was a pleasantly complex book much better than average read it created and resolved a scientific mystery on a topic i have wondered about and which is one of sciences classic what ifs but rarely tacked in literature to my knowledge i enjoy medicaltechno and science thrillers but only the ones that bring something new and deliver it skilfully where i cannot guess the ending scientific base is the key for me this one was a good one that i will remember i dont have much patience for two dimensional characters or predictable romance in resonance love is not just a redundant device and definitely doesnt run smoothly and there is light and dark there and some satisfyingly detailed accounts of procedures so that you feel you are wearing the gloves examining the specimens  i mean that the writing is skilful and carries you along suspending disbelief scudieres characters were for me unusual likeable nerdy rather than slick and definitely multidimensional some were religious which can be a turnoff for me  an australian from a society that isnt god fearing  but it was handled well in this case as a different point of view there were also two major scientific discipline perspectives not just medicine but geophysics the book dramatises philosophical as well as scientific problems which gives it some layersthe primary problem dramatised in the book is the prospect of changes to the earths magnetic poles beginning with local repolarisations and the author carries this through in a most engrossing way right to the end the notion of resonance and atomic frequencies is neat  i found the authors explanation very satisfying because it was logical and because you could keep developing more consequences in your mind  you do need to pay attention at the beginning in order to follow the rest and be patient if you dont like the first two characters the next ones are more engaging  i came on line tonight to pay the author my respects for a great book and to look at what else she has written|1
i believe that i have all recordings of this extraordinary piece of music the best of course is christian ferras and this one has to be the worst it seems that mehta and midori figure that exaggerating the slowness of the slow movement will make it more powerful more thoughtfull it does the opposite its boring and shows no emotion no sentiment|0
this is a great badly needed companion with the series for learning lakota you just cant accomplish the task without it|1
for some reason this soundtrack has completely missed the mark there are some songs on it but mostly rap thank god they included summer in the city by the loving spoonful some classical pieces but i dont recall beethovens ninth being in the movie and some additional score if youre looking for a soundtrack with a cool collection of songs youre in the wrong place if youre a real soundtrack collector youll be disappointed that the ants go marching theme which was featured so prominently in the film cant be found anywhere on this soundtrackabout half the cd consists of score and since the original die hard album was never commercially released  the only real reason for buying this album is to get as much of the legendary die hard score as possible and now theyve even stopped printing this album|0
sounds like they tried to assemble a case od hundreds to impress the listener this in an emotionalromantic work and they dont put out any emotionthe recording technical quality is marginal dont waste money on this one|0
this isnt music  this is more than that  buy it to understand what i meana|1
excellent fun my whole family enjoyed it brian does an excellent job capturing the kid experience i am so there with his take on gentle ben|1
im a loyal floyd fan since i first stumbled onto them in the early 70s but final cut is an awful piece of work compared to every other pink floyd album out there this one is the weakestyes its subjective so humblest apoligies to those who find it worthwhile personally its a lot of noise if you want to introduce yourself to pink floyd pick any one of their other works purchase this album only if you need it to complete your floyd collection this does not change the fact that pink floyd is one of the greatest bands of all time but they sure laid an egg with final cut|0
i am late in joining the fans of this band but i am happy to be part of the flyleaf club  this band brings a rock solid hard sound with good lyrics  i love their sound and am looking forward to whats next for this band|1
this is a disgrace to the original and thank god rachel ward  co had the sense and taste to stay away from this crap only chamberlain fell into the trap of fame and money what a shame|0
this is the album i recommend if you want to get started on pink floyd  it has many hits and the music is extremely melodic and catchy i used to not understand pink floyds appeal but this album got me curious about them  since there is 26 tracks i will review the highlights of this albumin the flesh  awesome opening track edgy powerful and the guitars are incredible there is no better way to open an albumhappiest days of our livesanother brick  youve heard this song  it is everywhere  i like it with the happiest days intro because it just leads into another brick so wellmother  great song the music is just flawless on thisyoung lust  one of my favorite songs on the album  it is a steady song that flat out rockshey you  awesome song and one of floyds most popular very well donecomfortably numb  pink floyds best song it is perfect from beginning to end and i personally think it is one of the greatest songs of all time  and that is the best title for a songrun like hell  an awesome rocker a popular floyd song that is often coveredthere are many short songs that help with the feel of the album and are quite awesome to listen to the thin ice vera etcthe wall movie as weird as it is really helps you understand the concept of the album  it is one of my favoritesa absolute pleasure to listen to from beginning to end  if you are new to pink floyd start here|1
brian regan is the best he is clean and and enjoyment for the whole family we have a great time listening to this cd over and over and over and over and always crack up brilliant|1
this is the 20th studio album from rush and their best in decades this new release finds rush in top form and at the height of their success they are just as big as they were back in the dayrush never fit into the neat box because you either got it or you didnt every track on this release is amazing it captures the best of rush removed keyboards for a more stripped down feel bassguitar and drums if your a fan its a must own every track is stellar on this brand new release from rush in my opinion their best in years|1
i compare this recording to my mel gibson hamlet video  i am glad i have both gibson and agerich just to know where the low end of the meter is gibsons reading of hamlet is  well  bizarre the low end of a scale topped by sir laurence olivier and kenneth branagh  bizarre is perhaps the kindest thing one can say about this interpretation richter  cliburn bronfman whom i heard live tonight a concert that confirmed my judgement  not agerich i dont understand the cult around her  proof of de gustibus non est disputandum|0
grandchildren and adults enjoy his music good music to dance to and just have fun i would purchase more of his cds|1
i am constantly telling people who have grown up in the postrock era or who have never been pink floyd fans because they were scared away by subliminal messages and drug references like i still am turned off by them that this is by far the best album ever made in the rock era  i am a huge beatles fan but i would still tell anyone to this day that this album is so head and shoulders over seargent pepper that its pitiful and that to me seargent pepper may have been the wall of its time but in my opinion only paved the way for the concept artistry and awesome studio production and musicianship of this masterpiece called the wall oh and by the way i always thought magical mystery tour was always a better album than seargent pepper anyway  i actually started off hating pink floyd as i was growing up because my older brother kept hitting me over the head with constant constant playings of dark side of the moon coming out of his room and coupled with the fact that pink floyd released probably the most lame song on the album money as its main single which has always been played ad nauseum for 30 years on classic rock stations didnt help either  the sound of that album even did begin to grow on me as i got older but it wasnt until high school when a fellow student and huge fan of pink floyd would hijack the huge high school choir rooms awesome high fidelity stereo system and blast the wall  throughout the halls of the music department that i really began to like that album  i wasnt wild about it at first but i would see the future minnesota state senators enthusiasm while he cranked up the wall especially on the part which goes when we grew up and went to school there were certain teachers who with its great bass guitar and helicopter sound effects that i began to like the album and it wasnt until after i graduated and looked back to the floyd lunch hours as some of the happiest days of our lives that i began to really see how awesome that album really was and enjoyed all of the classic rock airplay of the hits on that album over the years many until later i didnt even realize were all on the wall  because of this album i became a major gilmourguitar fan and was lucky enough to see the floyd in concert before they went dormant and i even developed an appreciation for roger waters musical concept of the world and although he doesnt have the greatest voice and that a lot of people hate his concept  i think some peoples voices and perspectives absolutely fit the unique kind of music that they do perfectly  ive only found 2 other albums that have the same effect on me musically as the wall because they have the same type of somewhat dark etherial conceptual and sophisticated studio production and feel as the wall and that is hounds of love by kate bush and so by peter gabriel and parts of tales of mystery and imagination by alan parsons project  if you havent heard these albums and are a big wall fan it would be definitely worth a listen to you  and finally i want to give props to a floyd man who i think was so instrumental in making the wall and some other floyd albums so awesome is michael kamen who died this past year  if you dont know who he is just listen to gilmours great guitar solos over the violinorchestral parts of comfortably numb and youll hear the orchestral arranging genious of michael kamen|1
i have seen brian regan perform at least 6 times over the years with the first being in jacksonville fl around 1994 or so he is a great comedian who will make you laugh from start to finish i purchased this cd when it first came out and i still laugh at it despite listening to it dozens of timesthis is a great listen for people of all ages kids includedhis humor is the happenings of everyday life from calling a seat in the car to little league and beyond it is a fantastic cd that is pure comic geniuson top of it he is an incredibly nice down to earth man he will always talk to the fans after his shows sign autographs pose for pictures etc an all around superb person comedy does not get any better than brain regan|1
while this might be the original broadway cast recording it  is not  the original and complete les miz  it should be advertised as containing selections from the musical because thats what it is most of the famous musical but not everything  for example the whole part after valjeans release from prison is gone  the cd listing jumps ahead to valjeans arrest for burgling the bishops house  how did he get there  whos this bishop  what did valjean steal  why did he steal  etc  unfortunately this is not the only omission  to compound the incompetence an extra track appears on disk 2 which contains valjeans death scene  this track however is not listed anywhere on the cd itself the packaging or in the booklet  if you want les miz then i recommend that you search for the complete symphonic recording  avoid this inept product like the plague|0

site and cd case say the beatles past masters  volume one but the cd is hear the beatles tell all interviews ripoff|0
and rather than appreciate this gift some people feel the need to nitpick its production or the fact that geddys vocal range isnt as robust seriously its as if some fans are so spoiled and feel offended that they didnt make the album that they wanted them to make rush has been working their musical asses of for 40 years and they have managed to stay focused and record what i think is their best overall effort since counterparts see you on tour guys|1
the last pink floyd album with roger waters  a sweet remastered edition that all pink floyd fans should have in their colection truly a band that introduced a new and ground breaking sound to rock  roll and changed the music world with a sound that is timeless|1
this is the worst beatles album all songs are good but phil spector did not need to put so much orchestratian in the album i still like the beatles but no  this is the worst beatle album i dont hate them i jsut think that spector should not have left this album the way it was and leave the orchestra alone|0
the beatles catalogue is generally thought to have three lowpoints one is let it be a set taken from a series of 1968 jam sessions that was remastered by producer phil spector who bombarded tracks meant to be a return to basics with a glut of overbearing orchestral accompaniment and electronic treatment another is yellow submarine the soundtrack to the bands 1968 animated feature that includes a sloppily throwtogether track listing of songs recycled from previous albums sub par unreleased tracks and a series of syrupy symphonic numbers the last is beatles for sale an album that was hastily recorded to be released in time for the 1964 christmas season by a group of tired tourweary beatlesin defense of beatles for sale some of the albums songs do not call for much sparkle and precision the covers in specific only required the sass and energy that effortlessly poured from these young performers in heaps rock and roll music everybodys trying to be my baby and their electrifying medley of kansas city and hey hey hey hey soar most of the originals however sag a little more time was obviously needed for the songwriting team of john lennon and paul mccartney to get comfortable and recharge their creative spirit compositions such as no reply i dont want to spoil the party what youre doing every little thing and mr moonlight sound like the beatles on autopilot insipidly going through the motions that produced their earlier hits the dry im a loser and the jubilant hit eight days a week are the only memorable contributions to the beatles songbook found on beatles for sale for the most part this is the sound of the fab four worn down by their hectic schedule and bereft of inspiration even the greatest performers can occasionally disappoint|0
love love love this cd  i have listened to it 100 times and cant wait for more new musci from slash|1
bought this album ahead of the raleigh show so i could listen to it on the way to the pnc arena it was good then saw rush play on may 3rd absolutely as great as theyve ever been listened to the disc about 3 times on the way home the next day during a 3 hour ride home it gets better each time well worth picking this one up and if you get the chance go see the boys live dont think about it just go|1
over the years ive bought or heard a couple dozen opera doro titles i cant think of one that i would consider a poor performance quite the contrary sills sutherland pavarotti etc are all in their prime singing everything from purcell to puccini and at rock bottom prices sutherland and her hubby richard bonynge team up for a good effort here too quibbling about the relative merits of top rank artists seems a bit pointless to me whether rossini intended his singers to sound like modern divas is another question check out andrea roosts performance of lucia with the hanover band to get an original instrument take on bel canto opera its wonderful to my ears but very different than todays big productions and canonlike voices but folks we have to face the fact that regardless of performance quality you give up a lot when listening to the poorly mastered radio recordings that make up opera doros fare a live performance can be splendid  check out gardiners terrific magic flute but it was a professionally recorded performance not an archived radio tape the local library has the decca hornesutherland performance so i can compare its more expensive if purchased no joke but you can hear the rich and wonderful notes nothing wooden no coughing just rossini the difference to me is night and day so you get what you pay for real pity but ooro is nearly the sole source for some works when is someone coming out with another la gaza ladra if money is a factor sure is here id check out other budget labels nice versions of rossini works like armida litaliana in algeri la cenerentola la donna del lago the barber and tancredi are available for around 20 or less and offer top notch sound if your senses are so keen that you can hear the performance in your mind i suppose the doros are terrific a lot of us have to rely on our ears opera is great its even greater if you can hear all of the notes|0
the final cut suffers a bit from not enough musical ideas and trying to make the lyrics the main appeal of the album over everything else  clearly this was an approach not everyone can appreciate including me  the lyrics are nice and some of the vocal melodies are good enough but this album is definitely lacking compared to every other pink floyd album created before this one|0
bought wilkies other celtic album and was disappointed read the good reviews and thought id give his group another try but once again was disappointed i call it mandolin muzak just plays in the backround and is  neither inspired nor memorable sorry for raining on the parade i really  tried to give this a fair try if you like irish music or cowboy music you  wont hear much of it here and you will probably not like this if you like  the guy whose name escapes me at the moment who drones on in that song  about the edmund fitzgerald you might like this stuff|0
recorded after the loss of waters and the loss of interest of wright and  mason a momentary lapse in reason is a gilmour solo album basically  bohemian works like learning to fly and sorrow are passionate enough to  work well sympathetic weeps for humanity such as on the turning away or  dogs of war come off as flaky and pompous waters knew how to display  intellectual tendencies without coming off as pretentious he also knew how  to make music that is timeless while this album with its high pitched  keyboards and its constant unneeded guitar solos sounds unmistakably 80s  the more personal aspects of gilmours music heard on his selfentitled  solo album and pink floyds the division bell work best only for pink  floyd completionists|0
watch out with this new series of beatles who are supposed to be remastered and made in japanthis not the case this is a false japanese mini lp they all come from lethonie estonie and russia the quality is ok but not good as a japanese they are a lot of defeats in the overall presentation but the most important thing its absolutely not remastered and the sound is exactly the same as the original even below also those cds are not in closeable plastic enveloppe as all japanese cd even brand new they had scratchs and are not cleanas a collector of japanese mini lp who bought this one i assure you this is a fake|0
this is kinda legendary album because there has been made a movie where the soundtrack is this album i think this is a great album but a little bit overrated theres only one hit and thats pink floyd only one another brick in the wall pt2 that is the song you may have heard we dont need no education we dont need no thought control theres also a great child choir singing the chorus theres also some other great songs although this is a onehitwonder for example the song goodbye blue sky is kinda creepy and young lustis kinda dirty song oohi need a dirty womanooooh i need a dirty girl one of my turns is at first peaceful one but suddenly it starts to happen its like a lightning i think that cd 2 is much better it includes songs like hey you comfortably numb run like hell waiting for the worms and the trial all the songs make a story and together this is a great story cd the guitar riff in comfortably numb is excellent i think this song should have been single another brick in the wall songs are just great i like the part i more than part ii it is kinda sadstars run like hell young lust waiting for the worms the trial|1
i was on a skiing trip in austria and one of the girls i knew liked green day and she only had kerplunk to my suprise i could not stop listening to it all the way home but then i bought it a month after i had listened to  it and i didnt like it as much i think you will love it when you first buy  it but you grow to hate it i did|0
the wall was the first floyd album where the lyrical concept overshadowed the music and for that reason it pales in comparison to dark side and animals both of which are a perfect balance of lyrical and musical genius  nonetheless this is still an incredible album  a rock opera in the truest sense of the word this is an album that has been both helped and hurt by its popularity  the incessant airplay of songs like another brick in the wall part 2 comfortably numb run like hell hey you and young lust can make the listener unfamiliar to the entire album believe that this album is about the songs instead of the story  that is why there are so many people who finally go out and buy the album and are dissapointed in the fact that it isnt 26 comfortably numbs that make up the album  some call the shorter less popular songs filler  those who do are missing the point of the album as a whole  this is not your average cd that you throw in your car to listen to on the way down to the grocery store  the wall needs to be heard felt and absorbed as a whole  it is more like a book on cd with backing music  although the soundscapes that back the main theme are a perfect fit and the music is melodic complicated emotional and energetic it is there mainly to help convey the emotion that is stated in the lyrics  the short filler is neccesary to bridge the different subject matters together and move the album from one theme to the other  lets put it this way this album is actually built like a brick wall  the bricks make up the most important part but the wall would collapse without the cement filler that binds it togetherif you arent willing to sit down and listen to the whole album it will probably go right over your head  but if you do take the time to sit and get emotionally involved it can be a rewarding albeit a bit depressing experience  this isnt floyds best musicnot that its bad they just have done better but it is one of the best lyrical concepts ever written and well worth the while for that alone|1
what how can it be how in hell can these 3 guys keep blowing my mind with wonderful soundsthere is no other band like rush and they are the example of what true talent is yet they remain humblelove the album personally i think it is 2112 and hemispheres combined a sortof continuation from the earlier conceptual pieces but hell what do i knowi know it is badass so cant wait to see it live yee haw|1
if you like smooth jazz this album is a competent well conceived even pretty example of the genre  but cant you be satisfied with just smooth  because this is not jazz  what does it lack  jazz is a soloists medium  there are great jazz ensembles that play magnificent arrangements but you wont hear many basie or ellington classics that dont feature spontaneous creative provocative and original soloists  sanborns playing is far too smooth to contain any of these traits  his playing is lovely it may soar and you may find it emotionally touching  but to those of us who love jazz in all its forms  traditional swing bebop hard bop post bebop free jazz from louis armstrong to muhal richard abrams  smooth jazz doesnt cut it|0
todavia esta en el mercado pero este cd no es tan bueno si lo compras te aburriras enseguida|0
not only this includes public si releases for native american social and ceremonial dances as any other recording in the exact order but it renames them in a wicked fashionother than that few track simply repeatdefinitely worth sparing your money for something differentps i would rate 0 stars but this thing wont let me|0
i bought this cd expecting it to be in the same league as wanda jackson unfotunately this is not the case comparing janis to elvis is a slap in elviss face as there is no comparison in the style or quality of the songs  maybe its irony that the one track on the cd you can listen to is my boy elvisif you want music you can listen to and enjoy get any of the wanda jackson offering  if you want to sit through an hour of the same miserable singing style then janis is for you|0
as a lot of them pink floyd fans please do note the ation marks have pointed out this album is not dsotm indeed thing is who said it intended to be like dsotm in the first place in my opinion this is the floyds masterpiece in terms of both songwriting and production just listen to it youll learn not only to appreciate pink floyd but also good music as a whole this album is also a lot more accesible than dark side of the moon or wish you were here which does not mean better imho its just as good as any of the previously mentioned albums but more accesible nonetheless its a great musical experience reallythe wall is mainly rogers solo project granted but dave does have a primary role in the project as well his guitar solos and the couple of songs he got credited for are wonderful pieces of music what really makes this record a geniune and everlasting gem is the fact that when a genius is given enough time food for thought and an out of this planet guitaristmusician the result is usually a masterpiece the reason why the wall is such a wonderful work of rock theatre is because waters wrote it almost in its entirety give a good listen to both the division bell and amused to death and youll understand what i mean gilmour is quite talented an awesome guitarist and he might be the better musician but without roger he is crud when its down to recording music period on the other hand roger is a wonderful lyricist songwriter and quite a decent musician a legitimate artist indeed he knows how to write good deep quality lasting music in other words the mans an artist and knows how to produce his art but whereas roger can do pretty well on his own if you put gilmour in the mixture its pure magic and thats what the wall is all about note that im stating all of these things based on studio recordings gigs are a different story without roger this project obviously wouldve never existed at all but without david it wouldve never been the same either they are both at their very peak on this album and it shows throughout they provided what they needed to and the result couldnt be any better it doesnt get any better than this the record is absolutely brilliantas for the album itself its extremely well connected coherent and wonderfully written all in all to all the people  who have claimed that this album is not coherent enough theyve one of the following two issues either you suffer from hearing problems or you cannot read between lines the walls concept is crystalclear the problem here is that pink floyds music has always been for smart people who do think and know about good artistic music people who can actually listen to the lyrics understand them and realize what the concept not only of the wall but of the floyd as a whole is all about as we all know not everyone is especially smart you need to know how to listen which is musics main point in the first place most people forget that these days limp biskit marilyn manson christina aguilera fans include yourselves here will you music real authentic music that is is written with the primary purpose for people to really listen to it and understand what it means and roger screams precisely that at the top of his lungs on this album as we all know it was indeed that very lack of listening from the fans which prompted roger to write the wallso if you consider yourself someone who likes good music actually listens to both the lyrics and the music and are smart enough to understand what mother should i build a wall hey you dont tell me theres not hope at all ive got a strong urge to fly but i got nowhere to fly to wheres the feeling gone will i remember the songs since my friend you have revealed your deepest fears i sentence you to be exposed before your peers mean altogether then do yourself a favour and go buy this record its amazing greatly crafted and you simply wont be able to stop listening for as with previous floyd albums as well youll discover new things with ever new listen its a whole new experience just as dsotm is in a class of its own as well theyre two completely different records but equally meaningful perfectly produced and enjoyable it obviously has the trademark pink floyd quality sound and production values just listen to it youll love this record and as i pointed out before youll also learn to appreciate good music as a whole not just pink floyd and the wall is a great starting point no doubt about thatif you dont qualify as a pink floyd listener and need catchy tunes and words that start with an f over and over again then you know what to buy britney spears sounds a good choice for yall doesnt it afterall to you shes a better songwriter than roger dave and paul mccartney together isnt shei might write a review in the near future about the overall concept of the wall a song analysis and my very humble opinion on the records contentthank you|1
i must have misread the cd description or maybe it was not stated that this is a potpourri of duets with the pearl fishers duet as the lead i thought it was misleading this is the first time i had had such an experience with amazon so i will definitely be much more careful in reading the description of the product prior to purchase  caveat emptor  from disappointed operalover in wilmington north carolina|0
as far as rock operas go this is indeed a fine work of art however its neither the best rock opera ever made or even pink floyds best album dark side of the moon wish you were here and the division bell all are better albumsthe wall has several problems1  its lead characer pink is an instantly dislikable hero forour story pathetic sad and loathesome he refuses to accepthe is responsible for his problems and likes to blameeveryone else2  no input from rick and minimal input from dave roger wasmore or less running the show at this point and while thatsfine from a lyrics standpoint its not good from a musicalstandpoint large portions of the album are tame musically3  confusing narrative its almost impossible to followsometimes its a rock opera for goodness sake you should beable to follow it with relative ease but you cantits far from all bad in fact for the most part it is actually quite good it is a very good album but not quite the faultless creature many claim there are many good songs including the bands best known another brick in the wall part 2 and the bands best ever song comfortably numbit is definitley an album everyone should own and it is very good i feel its just a shame its the second best known and bough floyd album out there when as i said earlier they have better albums on the market which noone pays a second glance|1
i bought this cd years ago and after moving my collection i dusted this off i remembered i didnt really like it the first time i heard it and after playing it again i remember why it is as one of the other reviewer said discofied tunes its copyrighted 1986 but the sounds are strictly 1970s generic tv sounds ugh everything was so badly synthesized i bought this originally thinking it was a compilation album of sorts hey if your thing is synthesized disco sounding tunes go right ahead if you are looking for closer to original reproductions look elsewhere this may actually be the first cd album i considered throwing away and after the used prices i see it going for i may just do that|0
i have been a fan of rush since 1982 my first album was signals rushs skills increased and became better and better under terry brown until they put out their opus magnums permanent waves moving pictures and signals then it all started to go downhill finally at some point rush released the horror that was vapor trails and they cant get let go of this new mediumthis album sounds like vapor trails the bass is muddy the guitar supersaturates everything there are no melodies the lyrics are sad and dark the drums are barely audible behind the ringing echochamber of guitar the cool hooks and solos of the past are nowhere to be foundthis is not music this is art i do not want to listen to art that is smarter than i am i want to listen to music signals was music good music this album is like the painting the scream its art but i dont want to stand around and consume itmake it stop rush the garden is the only serviceable song find terry brown renounce your arrogance and admit he made you what you were in 1982 a great band with an awesome rich beautiful sound|0
it only came with a booklet boring by the way and just one cd and only one track called terminal tower im a chemical fan but this |0
i can still remember the day this record was first released  we all had it preordered because we had seen michael with amy grant in concert and quite frankly he always upstaged her  the line the was outside the music store when this album arrived was amazing  the now christian classics friends and great is the lord was amazing live and to actually have the copy of it was just the thrill of our lives at that moment  now about 27 years later has it really been that long this album is definitely a must have for all collections  his giftings as both a writer and a pianist are highlighted here and mws is still one of the few artists whose anointing and talent have both transcended time and music trends  be sure to grab this one  it is still in my collection albeit a bit worn out by now so im back for the cd  mine even has the original album cover  highly highly recommend|1
oh dear i wonder who would buy this miles davis the greatest experimenter in jazz history is shown here as a person who is a bit of a sell out someone who makes jazz tailored for the smooth jazz market but the act is that was simply not true with this disc you dont get the whole story and worse still i dont think people are going to make a harsh miles to complement this one sure you get some of his best work but this only focusses on his first quintetsextet and his later fusion outings where is stuff in a silent way and some of his second quintets outingsstay clear away from this unless you are a cowardly smooth jazz fan|0

i heard from albertos mouth once that he was a close friend of cuates castilla and that he idolized them and loved their music with passion  so i purchased this album thinking this will be a great tribute album with albertos powerful voice and that this album was well prepared and created with lots of heart and soul the least one can do to honor such great mexican composers  to my surprisethis is a low budget low quality notfine tuned not properly mixed recording work  there are a lot of mistakes out of sync in albertos singing  most of the songs arrangements are very very amateur  no real or very few real musical instruments were used and no professional musicians were involved  no mariachi tracks at all  no mariachi  it sounds too electronic like midi music  the musical tracks sound like they were from a casio keyboard used to imitate instruments sounds  just think of alberto singing to one of those cheap karaoke tracks  i am very disappointed  not because of what i spent but because of the poor attempt to honor such great mexican icons in the songwriting world|0
1039smoothed out slappy hours the name is even bad this album is full of sloppy guitar and the same drum beats time after time and almost every song they sing about love if you can agree i think we have heard enough love songs for awhile this album is really just sloppy and contains lame guitar solo and horrible drum beats i mean the cover is even stupid it shows some goth girl standing by some trees what the hecks the meaning of that dont waste your money on this and instead if you want good punk get ramones first album or never mind the bollocks by the sex pistols|0
unfortunately only 2 songs here are worth listening too the first and last i think were alone now and couldve been  i guess this is what happens when you dont compose your own songs like  debbie does kinda a disappointment|0
i have to say daniel smiths playing is anything but mellifluous as a bassoon student i find listening to this recording both cringeworthy and uninspiring having heard the magnificent klaus thunemann play vivaldis concertos with superior virtuosity im inevitably going to compare him with smith  and they dont compare smiths opening statement in the c major concerto is vague and unconvincing his intonation is variable and his technique is lacking in well technique baroque music demands a specific type of rhetoric and there is no evidence of his attention to this detail its disappointing after reading the track list which promises to amuse to be met by a type of playing that holds you at arms length it appears that i am genuinely failing to recognise his appeal if i can offer alternatives  dag jensen and klaus thunemann|0
the wall is still quite an album for a number of reasons1 it does have something to say this record dates from a time when serious rock musicians were well educated and constructed sophisticated if misguided arguments with their music no matter that as we grow older we might think their arguments are wrong at least they had arguments nowadays the only thing that passes for ascerbic social commentary is marshall mathers keep it up eminem  youre our only hope2 yes its excruciatingly selfindulgent but so is a lot of really important art noone rapped vincent van gogh for his stifling selfpity when he cut his ear off and painted his own portrait with a bandage on did they did we smugly cackle at tracey emins foundobject sculpture of her own unmade bed actually we did and rightly so but tracey is no vincent van gogh nor is she a roger waters3 its desolate but strangely beautiful well not even strangely beautiful in some places just flatout beautiful the luscious major progression over the choruses in comfortably numb and that guitar solo waters plaintive lyrics plaintively sung in nobody home the icy barren angles of dont leave me now its affecting its hauinting and at least when youre seventeen it means something about your own life which nobody else on the planet understands4 it doesnt sound like anything else not even any other floyd record sounds like it its completely unmistakeable unique except for the bit that sounds like survivors eye of the tiger5 its funny yes intentionally funny in the happiest days of our lives we hear cane strike posterior from the owner  of the bottom the oh my god what a fabulous room routine the trial  a witty and very well drawn caricature of lloyd webber6 an axeheads delight all students of the electric guitar should own this record in another brick in the wall part ii mother hey you and comfortably numb you have five of the greatest guitar solos ever to land up embedded in polyvinyl doff your hat to david gilmour who also wrote and scored many of the achingly beautiful bits see 3 above7 its knowing on in the flesh the floyd pretends to be a band pretending to be the floyd and the record ends with a truncated sentence which is completed in the runin grooves at the beginning all frightfully selfreflexive but thats all jolly good fun in a pop recordand if that werent enough even though it was an expensive double album the wall managed in the straitened financial times of 1979 to sell 17 million copiesnow can seventeen million floydheads be wrong|1
if you expected traditional four part harmony this cd and the others from various championship competitions are a waste of your money  apparently the way to win one of these competitions is to create dissonant and difficult harmonies that render the titled songs almost unrecognizable easy listening this is noti would not recommend this or any of the other competitive collections to anyone over the age of 40|0

sometimes my mind just wont shut up so a peaceful guided meditation is just the ticket as nawang kechog explains it is like a puppy and must be reminded to sit down be quiet we all want to relate to life with compassion generosity and wisdom this is a tool that helps me do so with lovingkindness rather than a shock collar the music is a treat and transformational as are the teachers brief stories and he has a beautiful accent read oni did have to make some personal adjustments to the first part for instance i have fewer obstacles listening to someone with an asian accent dont ask me why maybe i think they are more pure maybe i was asian in a past life    whatever once i smoothed past that silly blip it was easy to reach a calm peaceful spaceall in all this is a regular station stop for my meditation train|1
pink floydthe wall isas far as i knowthe first darkdepressing album in historyfrom the hostile funky groove another brick in the wall pt 2 to the cries for help in comfortably numbwhich is the greatest song of all timeive had some people say that another brick in the wall pt 2 is trash beacause theyre ignorant and dont listen to the rest of the fricken album when they say we dont need no educationwhat they mean is by education is that over in england at that time and even today some places they virtually beat the children into submission trying to get them to do things their waythats the education they giveremember pink floyd is an english bandoriginating in cambridgeenglandthey were all born in england and therefore thats what they grew up withover there thats normalmaybe now some of the critics will change their mindstry listening to 1075 or sometimes 961 but mostly 1075they play another brick in the wall pt 1the happiest days of our livesand another brick in the wall pt 2 all in a rowlisten to the lyrics and then youll get itthat brings me to another pointthe flow of the storylinebasically the album is like a book which is why they were able to create a movie out of itfrom pinksthe main characteryou on the second side in in the fleshnote not in the fleshyou hear him say pink isnt well he stayed back at the hotel and on the first side in young lustwe have a call from mrfloyd to msfloydat least its supposed to say that but it says msfloyd to msfloyd insteadwhat givesfathers death in in the flesh to abandonment by his wifedont leave me now to his breaking point in outside the wallits a very sad storybut it happenshehehe as im typing the forest gump scene  happens flashes through my headso in other words all you critics shut mouths and listen to entire the albumpink floyd schools allnot even the beatles compare to themps rap sucks|1
great stuff here  and more than meets the first listen the songs are vibrant the arrangements have depth to them reminds me in places of classic steely dan the atmosphere the topnotch playing there are a lot of different moods on the album and it certainly stands up well to both casual and focused listeningfirst rate|1

simple answer not really do they dound good yea so did the original i played the songs side by side and the remasters are actually a bit shrill great packaging and extras but to compare eleanor rigby original sounds good remaster sounds good 51 dolby on the love cd awesome i f they remaster  in that format i would definatly buy them all of course i would probably buy just about any of my old cds that were remasterd in that format its that much betterbut for something that may be slightly better no|0
by this point in black sabbaths history we can relate the founders of heavy metal to the ottoman empire right before world war i  it was a hollow impotent almost embarrassing fragile shell of its former glory  so it is with black sabbath  frankly they should have disbanded after the mob rules and lived out their lives in peace tranquility and fortune knowing they singlehandedly created an entire musical genre  but no they pushed the limits and this is what iommi and the boys get  a silly attempt to look hard core satanistseriously i wonder what iommi powell and the others were thinking that last day of recording on the drive home  i cant believe we just released this drivel or maybe this will show em 80s thrash bands king diamondmercyful fate slayer danzig scandinavian black metal bands etc whos boss  its lyrically an aboutface in a really bad way from everything black sabbath has done in the past  its like the dead kennedys and the ramones praising the good works of ronald reagan  it just doesnt fit  if these lyrics were put to mayhem or danzig they would still be childishly silly but at least would mesh bettermartin might as well have written songs like happy birthday satan i love satan party at satans pad satan is a swell guy and its a wonderful day in satans neigborhoodmusically black sabbaths trademark droning guitars and lessthanwalkingspeed tempos are gone replaced by keyboardladen upbeat tunes that dont match the dark lyrical content  the production is good but the bass is practically inaudible  the drumming is very unoriginal and quite boring  its obvious that sabbaths jamming days of paranoid and master of reality are over  as a matter of fact sabbaths days should be over  periodbuy and enjoy everything before and up to the mob rules  avoid the rest like the black plague|0
plain and simple this is the best rush i have heard since moving pictures stand out songs for me are the garden which deals with a persons legacy also the wreckers which tells a story of a ship that is run aground by wreckers who back in the day made fake light towers to crash boats finally headlong flight is just instrumentally awesome in every way as for the other tracks they are fantastic also it was a hard album to pick a top 3 out of|1
this collection is pretty bad  the second hits collection is better  its not even really that funny|0
my two sons are 21 and 25 and loved raffi as children so it was only smart that i purchased this for my 2 year old grandsonhe loves the songs and sings along with himeven though baby bauluga is not on this cdi have to sing it every night at least twiceim so glad that they continue to sell these cds|1
this is by far the best deal on amazons new mp3 download store its a great album at an incredible price 899 for a double album with no sales tax and no drm you wont find this album in stores for any less than 20  tax and itunes sells it for 17  tax like another reviewer ive been wanting to get this album for quite some time but im a cheapskate but now was the perfect time|1
i simply have to bash this one i love pink floyd and recognize that even their bleakest albums have quality in them but roger waters egomaniacal trip on this one sure leaves a mark and an annoying one thus it is no surprise that this was his last collaboration with pink floyd despite waters inarguable merits and contributions the story goes that the mans obnoxious despotic and petulant ways were intensifying with the passing of time and this was the culmination guitar virtuoso david gilmore is muffled through the entire album and everyone else basically doesnt exist for with the exception of not now john the albums instrumentation is so lame and subpar that many tracks verily qualify as songs apparently walters just wanted people to hear his voice and lyricsit also seems like a postscript of the wall which also was a fluff heavy and over rated album which at least contrary to this one was saved by a couple of key songs in conclusion this album is mediocre and given pink floyds potentials a capricious nonsense if not an insult to the band pink floyds 1987 album a momentary lapse of reason was gilmores subsequent response without waters it not only was a much better album it made clear who pink floyds musical pillar really was|0
i bought this album for one piece that being track number four after i listened through the entire thing i found that i only liked tracks four and five and after listening to those a two more times i became very annoyedfor those of you who dont know la folia is just a piece with the same repeating pattern these patterns go on for one hour with this cd and become boring and annoyingtracks number four and five are really the only decent tracks on this albumdont become dissapointed with this cd like i did|0
terrible sound quality  very disappointed i requested money back from the vendor the cd suffered from incessant electronic clicking or static sounds throughout unbearable to listen to with any pleasurethis could be a problem with phillips as i had the same problem with claudios cd of 3 beethoven sonatas by phillipssound is muffled as well not well done i like claudio and was hoping to enjoy this but the noisestaticclicking is unbearable|0
i really like strauss ii and was hopeful about what would be on the collection  i should have listened to more of the samples before purchasing  it sounds like it was recorded with a childs fisher price play set  truly i have never heard a worse recording  when i could actually hear it  much of the recording drops below audio range|0
i liked the first album but this one is a huge step forward  the difference is that  the first album sounded like four highly capable musicians brought together to play some decent songs while this album sounds like a veteran band that has learned to write music and play together in a way that truly maximizes everyones strengths  the songs are great  melodic with choruses and hooks that will stick in your mind long after youre done listening  all four members shine as you would expect the musicianship is fantastic but no one tries to dominate and the songs take center stage|1
after listening to this cd repeatedly i knew it was something i had to rave about the pianist and arrangements are fantastic ive reviewed each piece for convenience this cd is a must have for all movie loverstrack 1 over the moon and flying themethe instrumental music begins quickly identifying this classic movie favorite the intricate detail of quickly played notes envelops the soul as the beginning of the piece grips your emotion and evokes nostalgia the ebb and flow of the notes come together like a finely stitched quilt and before you realize it you are taken on a journey through a cool october sky weaving in and out with an accelerated pace until the flying theme begins bringing in another pulse and dimension to the body of work delicately david glen hatch gently graces the notes with easy and effortlessness but alas in the second section we remember the heartbreak the music evokes and the possibility of a new adventureone of my personal favorites this song is the perfect beginning to the album as it gears the listener for the bevy of musical gifts soon to be heardtrack 2  feather themeas the piece begins you feel heartache the mixed emotion of joy and sorrow meet for a perfect composition of truth and then  as the music continues  joy wins and warmth and love surround the tenderly placed notes enhance the musicality and transforming you to an easier timean oldie but goodie theres something definitively special about this piece the way its performed completely outshines the music itselftrack 3 brionydeception betrayal the unequivocal anger and pain bellow through the speakers as if never to be forgiven eerie and daunting the music rises until utter blackness and the piece is completethe fast paced melody is gripping and emotionally raw i thoroughly enjoyed the extensive dynamic and feel of this piecetrack 4 the cottage on the beachin the beginning of the piece the harp carries the listener away into a beautiful dream one where love and passion live unbridled gradually the tone changes to hesitation but only for a moment before the dearest feelings of whimsy and affection ensueas i listen to this piece i picture myself in a hammock slowly rocking in the middle of forgetmenot fields the dependability of assonance brilliancy is never once ignored the beauty of each individual note is more incredible than the last i could no sooner choose a favorite star in the sky brillianttrack 5 love lettersin the beginning the urgency of something unyielding is unfathomable the ache for what cant be brings a visceral response and then for an instant there is calm as the violin in weeping the duet of intangible melodious anguish is mesmerizingits remarkable how david glen hatch seems to capture every emotive note and expressive feeling the writer has penned and without seeing some of the movies no less  i would say that it is only pure genius who can complete such a tasktrack 6 atonementthe melody line explains a lifetime of compunction each tenderly expressed note tells a different story of forgiveness regret and inner conflictthis piece is honest the masterfully stroked keys breathe so much life and integrity i savored each musical breath and understood atonementtrack 7 theme from beauty and the beastan epic love song with an epic arrangement the music of beauty and the beast gives you whether young and old the vision of living in a fairy tale where dreams always do come true  the constant crescendo builds up into a culmination of joy and unfathomable lovetrack 8 theme from schindlers listgrey and haunting like a memory wed like to forget the feeling of extreme despair shakes you to the core as we remember the immeasurable agony for those involved the violin pronounces a picture of grief so impeccably that its hard to not weep for the pain of our kindred human beings and with a final note it is as if the coffin is closedthis piece out of the entire album may be the most beautiful rendition of music every played as i sit and listen to each tender note its hard to imagine how difficult it was to find the inner strength to give such a gripping performance there are no words to describe the magnificence of the playing in this piece the emotion is raw and genius i can literally feel a palpable pain profound and blatant right before the violin comes in for the final time the unrestrained piano brilliance reminds us once more of the true genius of davids playing as the piece closes with those two unforgettable violin notes tears fall down my face  i have never before heard anything more beautifultrack 9 minor piano variation  track 10 piano variation in bluethese two selections are whimsical and full of fantasy i combined my review of these two pieces because i have the same feelings in both i enjoyed the articulately played notes the many eighth and sixteenth notes give the pieces an overall feel of imagination in the way theyve been presented in the second selection the use of the entire keyboard adds greater dimension conveying the realism of dreamstrack 11 my heart will go onthis selection is a simple melody i never felt engaged with this song when ive heard it before and ive felt james horner put as little effort into it as possible hoping for a little hollywood magic to propel his vision which it did however i feel that davids arrangement breathes more life into this piece than james horner or celine dion one of my favorites ever could the arrangement david created has much more feeling and depth than what the original music has to offer i can honestly say david glen hatch changed my mind about this piece and i now like it much moretrack 12 theme from the kings speechthis is an enjoyable movie with even more enjoyable music i adore this piece the feelings of rapture and grandeur effervesce and majesty and then heroism and triumph the melody is enthusiastic and vibrant and you end up feeling invigorated and cheeryi love the way the arrangement has captured the feel of the movietrack 13 14 15 16 dawn georgiana the secret life of daydreams  liz on top of the worldthe feel of these songs is like floating on a cloud its the perfect place to daydream and feel closer to your subconscious desires deliberately playful and completely contemporary we get the perfect mix of 19th century politics and 21st century refinement each selection hones in on its own distinctive story line but synchronizes the songs into a brilliant masterpiece which is pride  prejudicetrack 17 evergreenbeautifully modern and gently played this piece revisits a time of unbridled love this arrangement is sensitive and emotionally evoking testing the fates of time evergreen is one of those songs that will never get lost in the progressive modern day of newer and better but will remain a steadfast staple of irrefutable classtrack 18 when you wish upon a starone of my favorite songs from a film when you wish upon a star is reminiscent of childhood and all things good stemming from an easier time the piano arrangement with a jazz feel initially puts a more current spin on this classic but finishes with grandeur the arpeggios give a perfect david glen hatch touch listening to this selection made me feel like a child wishing i could lay under the piano and daydream while my daddy tickled the ivories once again|1
these are outstanding performances but they are marred by their having been recorded live in the month of december  that is during headcold season the frequent loud coughing not to mention the squeakingseat and shuffling noises is so distracting especially in the quieter moments of these sonatas i have labored mightily but have been unable to enjoy this recording it is a real shame given what an ideal pairing du pre and barenboim made i intend to purchase the set by yoyo ma and emanuel ax|0
this cd has to rank as one of the most overrated cds of all time overproduced pretentious and depressing roger waters arrogance permeates throughout the workthis 2cd set could easily have been condensed into one cd it has exactly four good songs  another brick in the wall part i  comfortably numb young lust and runthere are far better pink floyd cds than the wall including dark side of the moon wish you were here animals meddle pink floyd and echoes best of pink floydif you want excessive pretentious cds that are well done buy something like queens a night at the opera yes close to the edge emerson lake and palmers brain salad surgery or rick wakemans journey to the center of the earth  if you want two cds of roger waters whining then the wall is for you|0
i just saw this show at my local theatre and it is probably the worst and least funny musical i have ever seen  unfortunately i won the cd in a raffle and played it later on the ordinary and bland music and inane lyrics and dialogue brought back painful memories of sitting through this show  maybe some people will like this type of musical and i wish i could give them the cd but the three other people i went with also thought it was a total unfunny bore|0
rush is my favorite band i own all their studio albums and most of the live ones this album sounds a lot like the past three from rush like they spent a lot more time overdubbing in the studio than songwriting if you stripped these songs down to a vocal melody words and one accompanying instrument youd realize that these are weak yet masterfully produced songs the sections are disjointed the album doesnt flow well and some of the slower touchyfeely pianoacoustic sections are downright annoying the lyrics are cryptic and preachy as is often the case with this band  oh yeah and the album is 67 freakin minutes long  an acceptable album length is 3045 minutesrush gave us the longest streak of great albums ever from 19761989 and we should remember that  but this album is just disappointing|0
before iii came out i read a rolling stone review of the album and was a little bummed  i had low expectations going in  i really liked the first release so i thought it would be tough to beat the first one  after just one listen i must say they absolutely delivered on this one very solid effort by all  the music sounds much more polished this time around  it has a heavier vibe and the song writing appears more thought out rather than just a fun jam session if you like hard rock nothing out there right now comes close to this probably the best release of 2011 i really hope it will inspire others in this genre hoping it will chart well like last time|1
there is much that has been said concerning this album and i realize that this review is one of thousands  however i believe this album to be the greatest work of rock that i have ever experienced  experienced is the word for the wall not heard because it wasnt made to be a collection of songs with a smattering of hits to make some moneyroger waters wrote the wall with the intention of taking the audience through a journey  as i stated in the title it is a rather disturbing journey due to the disturbed state of waters at the time  although he was not dealing with radical mental problems like the former band member syd barrett had he was displeased with the bands station in the world of rock  this coupled with common difficulties afflicting most rock bands created very abstract emotionsthe story behind the wall is one of insecurity  centered on the fictional pink the album tells the story of his life  each song focuses on some period of his life coupled with the recurring theme of tearing down the wall  there have been many critics that argue whether pink does or does not represent roger waters  if not many of the feelings portrayed during the album do reflect waters own feelings shown by the fact that the album is so incredibly personalthe reason then that i would highly recommend the wall is that the whole album has the effect of great literature  an excellent book is written with the intent of transporting you to the artists world and letting you see through his eyes  as cs lewis said it is to feel my being enlarged  the wall is a rare work of music because it lets you see the world through the eyes of the artist  now whether you feel your being enlarged from it thats for you to decide|1
the collaboration between slash and kennedy seems to have found its mark with this collection of songs kennedy is the perfect voice for slashs ranging harddriving style paying homage to great sounds from the 60s 70s and yes even the guns n roses days slash tears through this album with a force i havent heard in rock in a long long time kennedys range perfectly accents the riffs and pulls a classic sound into the future i havent stopped listening to this since i downloaded it favorite tracks include not for me youre a liar the title track and no more heroes really though there is not a bad track on this well worth it|1
stay away from this product the worst i have ever heard i have never been so disappointed in my life it has got nothing to do with tom jones|0
to put this streight kissin doesnt understand rachmaninovs music at all he makes mistakes highschool students at moscow conservatoire are tought to avoid at a very early age i dont mean that my understanding is inevitably right tastes are different in the endhowever some pieces sound so bad you cant help feeling sorry for the pianist his rubatos lack elementary taste his pedal is a disgrace and at times a disaster in the end amazing second concerto sounds cheap and pitifulif you want to listen to a beautiful interpitation get richters|0
i have drifted away from rush over the last few years  while they have delivered some quality songs in the recent past there hasnt been an entire disc that has captured my imagination until now  clockwork angels is a solid effort from start to finish  it showcases their musical range while at the same time gets back to their hardedged rock n roll roots  a must own for any rush fan|1
the latest release from rush is brilliant  a story about the journey taken by a young man in a world where everything is ordered and controlled by the loving watchmaker set to some great music by rush  clockwork angels is still in heavy rotation on my playlist after a couple months  i am still hearing new things with every listen|1
i love the beatles lets just get that straight right from the start butwho ever is doing all the stereo remastering is off their rocker if youre gonna take the tracks and redo the mixes in stereo please do them in stereo not drums over here bass over there lead vocal in the center piano on the left geeze you would think that an engineer qualified enough to remix beatle albums would have it together enough to do it well sorry but i find this unlistenable and would gladly return it|0

if you just must have some pink floyd in your collection buy either the wall if you want the best music or dark side of the moon if youre following the herd and want to say that you own it  in either case id say that this album is not essential for a pf  collection and that pf is not really essential to a great rock collection  there were too many other bands breaking ground to spend time on this  oneoff stuff|0
okay i had never heard of a j scudiere until i was contacted with the possibility of reviewing some of her audio movies so i didnt really know what to expect  the summaries sounded good but those can be deceiving sometimes  well i received three audio movies from ms scudieres publisher and decided to begin with resonance  i think i knew right away that i was going to like itthe story begins with snapshots of the main characters in their various locations an archaeologist who has just discovered a 65 million year old link to some currently occurring phenomena a biologist who has discovered some strangely mutated river frogs and a couple of cdc physicians who are seeing the beginnings of what could be a major epidemic  some pretty exciting stuff to begin a story with and yes i was already curious as to how these would all connect up  the middle part of the story slowed down a bit for me and i was thinking it would end up as a fairly typical medical thriller  then scudiere threw a really wild twist in toward the end that i honestly never saw coming and it was pretty coolfrom my extensive experience reading books it seems like the hardest thing for an author to do is to create believable characters  you know characters who speak think and act like real people in the real world  not a problem for scudiere  i found her characters to be ultimately convincing in their actions and speech especially main characters jordan and jillian  they are cdc physicians who are the first to stumble onto what is going on and are in the thick of it throughout the story  it has become their job to save the country and possibly the world from a new outbreak  they do their jobs well but continually struggle with doing their duty versus saving themselves and their families  just like real people wouldresonance is a full cast audio production featuring the voice talents of paul boehmer gabrielle de cuir carrington macduffie stefan rudnicki emily janice card ellen dostal bob duncan stan jensen richard learman margy moore scott peterson tom schiff mirron willis and judy young  special guests include david birney rosalyn landor and arte johnson  now a few of these names are new to me but there are also a few here who are pretty big time narrators  everyone knows stefan rudnicki and you may also know a couple of his conarrators from the enders game multicasts gabrielle de cuir and david birney  ive heard paul boehmer on a few books now and always enjoy his narrations and of course emily janice card is pretty well known in the industry as well  and arte johnson  yeah its that arte johnson  i did a mental doubletake when i saw that name  i was half expecting him to read with a funny german accent like the one he always used on laughin interestingbut shtoopid but of course he didnt do that  he used his own natural voice which lends itself well to the audio genre  i guess this is what you might call an allstar cast and it was a fantastic experienceresonance is a good scifi thriller  and for those of you who are perhaps not crazy about science fiction i can tell you that this is the soft kind without the really detailed scientific explanations  scudiere writes in a manner that is easy to understand and follow along with|1
i purchased this for my son and daughterinlaw who are expecting a baby  they were both raised listening to raffi songs and were thrilled to receive this  they have already been playing the cd and reminiscing and singing along to their favorites a true classic|1

this is an example of historically informed performance gone wrongjoshua rifkins research into bachs one voice per part ovpp choir is to be commended whether its true or not  however in terms of both interpretation and recording quality one could not ask for a worse example of period instrument performance or performance on any type of instrument for that matter  the cantatas are played quite listlessly very clean every note in placean attempt at perfection while sacrificing musicality and emotion  the continuo is without imagination whatsoever and the choral sound is consistently lacking warmth and presence  whether this is a consequence of using ovvp or just ineptitude on the part of the sound engineers is debatable  paul mccreesh uses ovvp to astounding effect so perhaps its the latter fault  in any case this recording gets two thumbs down for boring turgid overly academic performances of otherwise beautiful music poor sound quality analagous to a photo thats just almost in focus but a little fuzzy around the edges and a total absence of feeling and emotion on the part of the instrumentalists and singers and ultimately the director joshua rifkin|0
im a musician and always play live music i wish they didnt use so much digitial instruments or keyboards because you lose the integrity of real musicians i am a big fan of keith staten but i only gave it a 2 star bcuz a one star said i hate it and i didnt hate it however i was very disappointed in this project still love commissioned though|0
ill resist pontificating like the rest of the experts offering rush my suggestions on how it should be done i just want to say that this is a great collection of songs  its given me great joy to listen to it over and over  not many modern releases give me as much satisfaction  replay value as this release has the past week  hats off to the band for continuing to follow their muse while still staying relevant  one of their best imo|1
well firstly this album is no bomb the line above refers to a line in a song from the album called mother its fantastic while the wall is not pink floyds best album it comes close  it features parts 1 2 and 3 of another brick in the wall which is the only way to fully appreciate this song  the radio edit version is good but not as effective as the album versionother standout tracks includecomfortably numb  this song sends shivers up my spine every single time i hear it  if you enjoyed on the turning away from their momentary lapse of reason album you will love this they have a similar feel to themrun like hell  the introduction to this is simply brilliantreleased in 1979 it was ahead of its time then rereleased in 1999 as a new digital remaster it should have stated on the sticker 20 year anniversary but got a 30 year anniversary sticker by mistake a small detail  the new digital remaster is worth owning|1
this is one of my favorite flyleaf cds i bought this a couple years ago and still listen to it every once in a while alternative rock girl singer not everyone likes it but alot of girls do lol|1
awesome cd heard about flyleaf from my sisterinlaw and i love it  will definitely buy more of their music|1
ive been waiting for years to hear a breakthrough album like this from rush if you are an old school rush fan and have not been checking in on their music of late now is the the time im on my first listen to the new album and this has an edge creative interesting sounds and killer bass and drum the vocals are better sounding with good harmonies and not doing too much the guitar shreds and fills out the sound nicely i hope you enjoy this creative outburst from a band i have always enjoyed listening to thank you rush|1
although many fans consider the legendary beatles final album their best try as i may i just can not see abbey road as anything great oh darling maxwells silver hammer and octopus garden are just silly the song suite on the second side is well constructed but utterly confused and jumbled and i want you shes so heavy becomes very tedious only come together something here comes the sun and the cool cover image reflect the bands past greatness you may enjoy it many do but i would recommend  revolver sgt peppers the white album and even lesser acclaimed beatles albums such as magical mystery tour and let it be before the weak silliness of abbey road|0
although i love classical music this cd was awful i guess i had expected more it wasnt the cds fault|0
im an avid lover of celtic music but this is not celtic music everthing is slow and almost sounds the same all instrumentation is the same no variety  painful|0
i like sugar town and somethin stupid and it was worth purchasing this disc even only just for those songs however since i like only two tracks on sugar its only worth 2 stars and if id thought hard about it i might have bought the greatest hits disc instead of this oneat any rate buying this one leaves open the possibility there may be other noncompilation nancy discs to buy but frankly no pun intended how could there be anything better than somethin stupid and sugar town|0
i was very disappointed in this transaction  the product description said hit em up but when i received it hit em up was not on the cd  |0
i got the cd today and its truly moving and a masterpiece at least  it deseves 7 stars  it has flaws but i do not skip a single track ever  pink floyd at its best|1

i thought cds where all the songs rock were a thing of the past untill lacy and her band came along this has the energy of van halen 1 your not playing the cd over and over wondering which songs you will like they all rock really hard this band is goinng to be huge to me they are right now check out the song tina its not on this cd but is a really great song thats the song that made my say wow these guys jam if you finally want to hear a great new band buy this they do not disappoint|1
this is put simply one of the worst albums i have ever listened to i listened to the first 30 seconds or so of the first song and hated it then i skipped to good night and listened to those violins fading out only for the satisfaction of knowing that the piece of garbage was finally over dont give that warmonger lennon and his cronies any of your hardearned money there was a reason he died you know it doesnt even have yesterday on it you do the math|0
i first listened to this album in the mid1980s as a teenager michaels music touched me in a way that no sermon could ever do i began to see christianity not as a set of rigid rules but as something that could uplift me and make me a better person through positive living i will forever be grateful to mws for leading me back to christ while ive bought and listened to all of mwss albums since none of them has touched me like this album and project did ive listened to it thousands of times over the years and i never tire of it mws lives the life and thats reflected in his music thank you michael for saving my life and giving me endless hours of pleasure|1
this is a great rush album all the songs are very good and a few are great seven cities of gold the garden these guys just dont run out of ideas i saw them on tour last year and and they sound great live too|1
dont make the same mistake i did and get the newer 2007 version the sound is not much different to the original recording if its remastered it should have included the original booklet info along with the new liner notes otherwise it is a great musicalid get the 1990 release or earlier of this which does include the lyrics of the songs and not just pointless liner notes|0
i hate the beatles im so sorry that they never made anything decent because they are a 60s band well the 60s is a reallybad decade of music abbey road is a really horrible album witha few of the most horrible tracks in here comes the sun dont buy this awful album go buy any joe walsh dire straits foreigner guns n roses green day or nirvana instedand please follow whirligigs recommendations|0
joan sutherland without a doubt has one of the most beatiful voices of opera but here she attempt to sing a role way to large for her lyric voice  the role of turandot is meant to be sung by a soprano of much  larger size like nilsson or eva marton  pavarottis voice is also to  small for this role  one wants to hear someone with the vocal size of  corelli or ben heppner singing calaf even domingo is a better calaf  caballe is a brillant liu but she is not enough to save this recording  if  you want to hear turandot as it was meant to be done purchase the recording  with nilsson and corelli or purchase my personal favorite the recording  with ben heppner and eva marton  nilsson corelli heppner and especially  marton have sung this role to great acclaim on stage and are the right type  of voice for these roles  sutherland would have been laughed off the stage  had she performed this in public  if you want to hear sutherland at her  best buy her in a donizetti role  and if you want to hear her with  pavarotti buy their recording of rigoletto|0
im not a huge floyd fanatic but this was the first floyd album i got i heard that it was one of pink floyds greatest so i went and got it im not dissapointed at all well you know there are some songs on this album that are just not good or just kind of dumb i hear alot of people saying that their music is just boring well usually alot of them are but thats floyds style all the music they really make is just psychodelic stuff you gotta really listen to it instead of just listen to two minutes of it and wonder where all the guitar riffs are then change to the next song and do the same thingi love heavy metal punk rock and pink floyd has to be one of my favorite slow passed rock groups|1

sad how the original composer henry mancini had passed on earlier before this film was made  unfortunately they should have left both the movie and the music alone  not only was the music tampered with due to the fact that a new composer was needed but they shouldnt have tampered with the original scores and as for the movie it was just completely off track from the actual storyline and original miniseriesan interesting movie to watch for pure amusement to how they altered it but the cd just isnt the same with original scores altered|0
this is a wonderful recording ofjarocho music the typical musicfrom the state of veracruzi recommend it to everyoneit isbeautiful|1
this recording is the utmost example of gross failures specific to mid 20th century bach performing slow melodramatic playing totally disrespectfull to authors demands large choirs in which not a single word is clearly hearable gigantical orchestras where no instrument is possible to be followed as a single string the tempi are also very mismatched overall playing time should be no less than half its length the opening chorus one of greatest movements in the history of music is reduced to a mere wreck bastardized into cheap melodramatic shallowness klemperer mocked bach as karajan he should better resume to romantic authors and leave bach rest in peacemodern historically informed performances have replaced bachs choral works back to their place in musical history gardiner and herreweghe have made sheer artistry and their passions should be the very first choice for any advanced listener if you still feel more akin to prehip then i fullheartedly recommend karl richter but never klemperer|0
would not recommendcould have purchased for same price elsewhere with the original artistsnot satisfied at allwish i could get my money back|0

being a big time beatles fan since 1964 there is still no other band that gets as much play around my house great choice of songs here that any one would love to hear over and over againthe red  blue albums are examples of stuff the record label was putting out with no other reason except to offset the sales of paul mccartney  john lennon solo lps in their pitiful effort to force the beatles back into reforming  along with lps called rock and roll music  love songs notice they would always release them at the same time john or paul had a new solo lp coming out just buy the official beatles cds and all your dreams will come true lol|0

roger waters has astutely said that this album is a pretty good imitation of pink floyd though the guy has shown himself to be a total egomaniac over the years i have to admit hes right especially after comparing the entire floyd catalog starting at album one with a momentary lapse this album tries and largely fails to capture those drawn out brooding instrumentals that were so unique in the floyd repetoire in fact the back half of this album is so excruciatingly boring you begin to wonder if the talenteddavid gilmourand his slew of cohorts were resting on their laurels and just cranking this one out for the almighty dollar i cant fault gilmour for the first two songs  those stand up well but the hopeful anthem on the turning away as well as dogs of war are pretty much garbage when compared to past floyd work and gilmours formidable solo albums as i said and waters before me this is a cheap imitation of a formerly great fourpiece band buy old floyd or gilmours two solo albums instead|0
i am really liking this cd im a huge myles kennedy alterbridge fan and this cd rocksi like slash a lot too and his guitar work on this one is impressive but this appears to me to be myles baby he wrote all the songs should be titled myles kennedys apocalyptic love feat slash|1
this band is considered according to wikipedia as one of the founder bands of industrial music and since i have no better source as to who those bands might be i trust wikipedia  and this album indeed does delivers one classic industrial masterpiece which is the first song on this album  however the other songs are mostly offputting but interesting hardly to be considered industrial but certainly experimental  i remember thoroughly disliking the third track but its one of the shortest ones on the album and it grew on me a bit  anyway i wouldnt suggest buying this really  its incredibly short and mostly disappointing|0
once more kim robertson ventures into the realm of christmas music for contemplation however she is accompanied on this outing by accomplished cellist virginia kron although five of the fourteen selections are solo celtic harp performances  much like her previous effort celtic christmas robertson again draws from the rich history of christmas carols plainchant folk melodies and ancient dance the result is a lyrical performance of charm and enchantment robertsons mastery of the harp and her discerning talent for arrangement is clearly evident on this thoroughly engaging album for the quieter moments of the yuletide season celtic christmas ii is highly recommendedtrack listings1 el tutu  3472 the darkness is fallingaway in a manger  4223 a la nanita nana  231   solo harp4 as joseph was awalking the cherry tree carol  211   solo harp5 paduana  2486 jesos ahatonhia twas in the moon of wintertime  2297 we three kings  305   solo harp8 silent night  3449 noel nouvelet sing we now of christmas  23410 verbum supernum the word of god  146   solo harp11 merrily on high  137   solo harp12 come all ye shepherds  45613 pastourelle  22014 christ ist erstanden christ is risen  340|1

there are probably no better turandot and calif on  record than birgit nilsson and jussi bjorling  but strangely enough rca  has remastered the sound of this historic recording made even more  interesting with renata tebaldi singing liuso that it is flat  dull and unexciting  not my favorite opera it is at least always  hairraising  but not this set of cds  in fact the vinyl recording had  better sound  i dont think i would ever rate sound quality more important  than singers performances except in this opera where opulant sound is  everything  if you are looking for a complete turandot look  elsewhere|0
im on fing fire is repeated loudly on the 5th track impossible to ignore this cd has a fry mentality for example sinister laughter when a daytripper attitude was possible this is not a joyful  piece those desiring peace of mind or relaxation should look elsewhere  perhaps good for a rave but the profanity renders this unsuitable for  background music in the family den or dentist office eliminate the vocals  altogether and this would be outstanding trance|0
my son thinks this guy is the funniest thing in the world  i like that the guy isnt vulgar its a shame more comedians cant rise above the banality inherent is taking the low road  good christmas present|1
family singalongs in the car arent what they used to be  sometime during the last century kids and grownups maintained their sanity and wakefulness during long trips with bingo and 99 bottles of beer  nowadays apparently be kind to your webfooted friends  et al have been replaced by hit showtunes from the wiz the theme from the original star trek and selections from brady bunch reruns  granted the star trek theme isnt humalongfriendly and no one ive ever met has reported singing tunes from doctor dolittle en route to summer camp but this compilation was put together by rhino the famed reissue label  and surely rhino knows what people listen to  so grab this one before its gone forever so that the next time the kids beg from the back seat put on some judy garland youll have just the cd on hand to keep the peace|0
25 stars reallythis was my fifth pink floyd album after the amazing meddle dark side wish you were here and the wall when the tigers broke free the gunners dream the fletcher memorial home and the final cut are good enough to salvage an otherwise unremarkable and seemingly directionless albumyes i was deeply disappointed with this when i first heard it but now i realize that this isnt typical of roger waters and his way of controlling the band at the time yes this is practically a solo effort floyd fans should get it for the bright spots but somehow this piece belongs in the catalogue of completionists only bold statement well im talking through a pink floydpoint of view not waters this certainly qualified for the nextcoming floyd album as well a momentary lapse of reason after waters departure but thats another storypeople claim this to be the last true floydalbum that i dont agree with waters was largely focusing on one thing and one thing only himself surely it wouldve made a nice addition to his solo career instead of connecting the floyd banner to it however i dont want you to get me all wrong this being a solo effort doesnt necessarily mean its a bad record the lyrics are occasionally good but i was always one to enjoy the amazing blend of floyds lyrics dark side along with a fantastic spacy sound meddle clearly this record lacks the latter|0
the music which plays when you click onlark ascending is most certainly not vaughan williams i would guess it is oscar peterson anyone else got any ideas does this happen often i am not sure how else to warn people  about this other than in a review|0
its a wonderful cd with songs that touch our heart songs that come directly from the throne of god the first of many wonderful cds|1
would recommend highly brian regans humor is comedy that the whole family can enjoy great for listening on long road trips|1
i have been listening to this album for the past several weeks and feel that this is right up there with their best  i have all 19 studio albums plus the first live album  i have had several of these songs stuck in my head  i have awoken in the morning with either the anarchist carnies headlong flight wreckers or wish them well playing on the flash drive embedded in my brain  the only way to stop it is to get in the car and upload something else during the drive to work  typically other rush songs  gearing up to see them at jones beach on june 23rd and then at spac on june 25th  i want to hear this collection live|1
ladies and gentlemen welcome to the hipsters torture hour brought to you by those friendly people at spectre sinister periodpractice enacted to counter traditional readings everlastingly  im your host

father melchizedek was all dolled up in pharisee robes as he so calls them borrowed from his good friend archimandrite archimedes spanikopita better still his pectoral cross was looking resplendent under the studiolights the cleric is rarely afforded a chance to appear on tv it was time to make haynow my dear audience tonight were going to deprive you of your weekly fare of music for the lute or

seatsir woger its an honour to have you here thanks for your time i am a great admirer of yours youve been in the vanguard of the fight against karajanism whats your credowell padre thats simple no vibrato vibrato is a practice that was cooked up in 1938 by the third reich just listen to bruno walters mahler 9  the one he recorded on the eve of anschluss i cant hear any wobblewobblewobble from the strings yes vibrato is a child of totalitarianism  hitler authorised it himself and it was promulgated by bormann vibrato adds weight to the strings and thus obscures the woodwind which is undemocratic in the extreme i repudiate this evil to clarify matters further we cut back on the strings per se nothing adds drag to a performance like romanticism thats why i adopt flowing springheeled tempi nor should the music need any advocacy on my part to speak to an audience its innate im there to beat time that means no grandiose gestures or underlining of the socalled emotional content plainjane at speed is the way to gothis is going to be a disaster and you know it abbado hissed at his boss at worst this guy is an agent provocateur from universal imports at best he is a

mindless iconoclasm as bad as that was the socalled andante con moto was even more of shambles in fact it was groundzero antischubert as schubert there was no feel for the long lines  it was shortwinded punchy and obstreperous the scherzo was less obnoxious if only as it seemed more receptive to wogers wilful evocation of pure energy the trio was a stinker a celestial marriage it wasnt

sit there in a state of stupefaction you must act do you really want to hear the london classical players  those poor fiddlers  tackle the finale with the triplets a thousand years will pass and the shame of spectre will not have been erasedtoo late he spoke the london classical fiddlers lurched into the finale the famous triplets will test any orchestra of mettle  the berlin and vienna

ive never understood the fuss about the beatles  ever  after growing up with it my parents listening to it some of my friends listening to it and each and everyone one of them being very defensive when i tell them i dont like their sound  i dont care if they brought about pop music as it is today i dont care if they influenced a lot of bands today i dont care about any of that  what i do care about is whether they can make a compelling and interesting album and unfortunately thus far i have not found it  ringo starr is a mediocre drummer  there have been plenty better in the past 45 years but everyone raves about the beatles once more  the bass as played by paul mccartney overrated in his solo career as well is lacklustre and uninspired  the vocals throughout the entire thing are annoying at best i hate their voices  too floaty not very melodic  and the lyrics are just tacky throughout  the only saving grace on the entire record are the guitar solos scattered throughout the album  that is the only reason abbey road gets 2 stars rather than 1  best album ever  please  the beatles are horrible and entirely overrated|0
buy this album  there really isnt much more to say  in fact buy dark side of the moon too  if you already own it heres a tip  if you listen closely at the very beginning of the cd you hear what  sounds like a sentence thats been part cut off  the very beginning of the  sentence is actually in the last second or two on the 2nd cd  weird|1
im not really a carpenters fan but there were two songs i wanted for variety around christmastime and they are both on this cd|0
pretty compelling effort especially for guys that have been doing this for so long with so many twists and turns possibly their best effort since presto which is the album that originally hooked me i havent fully absorbed clockwork angels and i know that im not in love with every song on the album but it is very solid as a whole im enjoying it|1
this latest and hopefully not last incarnation of rush might not be my favorite but i dont dislike it at all what they have wrought in these past two albums with booujzhe is what happens when true fans of music get together and have fun im energized by the eager enthusiasm  anythinggoes spirit infusing these songsthese may not be the trios strongest songs in the discography but they are certainly wellbuilt with beefy melodies and retrogood hooks rush still have the musical chops they had in the 70s im not even sure if their younger versions could keep upwhile lyrically a concept album each song stands on its own musically this is not the 2012 overture and its no 2112 overture either its no instant classic but it is another solid piece of work by the band and if steampunk has a sound then this is what it sounds like|1
ricky petersons look whos lonely now recieved lots of airplay in the early 90s  naturally i purchased the cassette and expected more the same  unfortunately the album was a disappointment  what would have made the recording better was more music  only 5 tracks  if all of the tracks wer 8 or 9 minutes in length it would have been a different story  aside from the successful track look this is a downer|0
i have this on album have the live release on cd as well as the release of the wall in berlin  this is a must have period  as with most pink floyd recordings important to listen to this from start to finish  see the movie release also  worth it|1
i usually love these cds and i own at least six i was hoping for something to fall asleep to unfortunately the music isnt relaxing i love falling asleep to thunderstorms so i thought this cd would do it but the background music is too upbeat|0
great album and the book that was written to go with it by kevin j anderson was phenomenal  |1
i work in radio and i get paid to listen to music god bless america and i have always found pleasure in being able to enjoy music by pink floydand the wall ranks up there in my opinion as easily one of the top10 best albums in rock music while the debate rages over their inclusion into the pantheon of alltime best i firmly believe that even after listening to the wall for the trillionth time that roger waters has written a true modern audio masterpiece  and like most albums you buy and have to skip the lesser known tracks that dont achieve the greatness of some of the songs with the wall you just slip the cd in hit play and enjoy allthewaythroughlike many fans of pink floyd my first real introduction to their music came from the repetitious airplay of another brick in the wall part ii and id apologize for the overplay of that tune but i never got tired of hearing it  but there was so much more to this incredible album  run like hell  hey you are just two examples of songs that compel you to listen  and of course comfortably numb without a doubt one of floyds greatest musical pieces  if you are a fan of this band and you dont have the wall in your collection it is high time you forked over the  and sit back and enjoy some really great stuff  trust me this is rock music that will endure|1
ill just stick with appraising the sony essential classics ormandy ein heldenleben  youve got to have had a medium hifi sound system to bypassthe ultra bright sound of a top notch ormandy interpretation an audiophile system reveals the greatness of a recording and its deficiencies columbia never could find a recording venue in philadelphia to do justice to the philadelphia orchestra and this sonic atrocity was taped in the gosh awful manhattan center in new york city in 1960with a quality stereo system and a good equalizer this recording can be made listenable and ormandys conducting savored on my numark 20band octave equalizer i dipped 960 and 1920 khz by 12 db cut by 6db are 3640 and 7680 khz surprised by what surgery i had to do i checked the cd with my shure sh 440 headphones the ultra bright sound was there i do have the fritz reiner living stereo eh and it seems to me that the sacd hybrid might be worth owninghavent checked lately to see if its available but sir thomas beechams last recording was of ehif it is that would make an excellent addition to a classical music lovers collection|0
i believe that this cd is advertised with misleading or missing information since the inception of cd technology when a cd is created from an original analog source tape as are those that were not recorded digitally they are remastered in stereo  this cd has been remastered in mono  oh no  yet the seller does not mention this in their advertisement  the sound sucks  i am very disappointed with this purchase warning warning warning to all|0
to everyones taste noold fashioned and unlike anything made these days yesa superb album to me and millions of others  yes certainlyfor certain other reviewers and im stretching the term a lot here1 since when does what mtv plays mean anything other than whats currently the fad can you spell or understand narrow minded and childish2 since when do song lyrics have to be gramatically correct see mtv for exampleseither give good reasons or stick to opinions rather than dreaming up rubbish reasons why you dont like something this is purely my opinion  feel free to disagree|1
in my humble opinion smiths christmas cd is the best one ive ever heard and i have listened to manyadmittingly since i am a big michael w smith fan i purchased the cd with high expectations  fortunately the expectations were exceededthe cd contains a nice balance of reverent all is well and upbeat songs christ the messiah with each song positively contributing to the spirit of the christmas season being the kind of person who listens to christmas cds yearround i heartily recommend the cd to anyone who either plays christmas cds only during the holiday season or yearround|1
okay the music is on this disc but because of some weird electronic filter it can only be played on an oldfashioned cd player not on a computers cdrom drive the advert didnt tell this so i have wasted my money because i really no longer have a cd player does anyone still buy such antics|0

okay you could argue it never left but lets face it the rush from the 70s and rush from the 80s onward are very different bands one band was a progressive rock giant creating 4 spectacular progressive rock albums each with 1520 minute masterpieces that are undeniable classics the other band is just as good even though they became what one could call a progressive pop band and they made the transition better than just about any of their peers i like both bands equally but i was longing for a return to the 70s form creating concept pieces with the addition of their modern lyrical themeswell did we get it in clockwork angels for the most part yes the album fits firmly in the category of progressive rock at the same time it is also undeniably modern day rush with all their modern sound and noise present dont worry no loudness war rant here i like the noise but it also is a callback to the earlier rush with the entire album having a loose concept from beginning to end the concept involves a futuristic society with interstellar travel and a rigid belief system enforced by the big brother like watchmaker what i really appreciate about the album though is that almost all the songs can be taken out of context and still be enjoyable some of rushs best tracks ever are on this album particularly bu2b which to me calls back to their early hits like working man or a passage to bangkok halo effect is probably the best song on the album lyric wise it reminds me a lot of closer to the heart and i have a feeling it will become a concert staplethe one complaint i do have is that i wish neal had gone farther with his concept while this might have sacrificed some of the commercial appeal of the record i think it would have been great to have a true full fledged concept album that told this same story while the songs are all great there is an element of being unfinished concept wise the latter half of the album suffers from this somewhat as the songs become longer and you realize their telling a story you dont have enough information to fully understandoverall though this is a spectacular release and hopefully indicates a return to rushs early form|1

this review is not about the album itself which is a must have but about the newly released remastered version this album along with much of the early beatles catalogue was originally intended to be heard in monophonic sound which was the standard of the industry at the time  it was later that the stereo versions were created and the result was often very poor  it is often impossible to take music that was recorded and mixed for mono and make it sound good in stereo all you can do with a two track recording is put instruments on one side and voices on the other etc  sometimes even the music itself was affected with different arrangements of harmonica lead guitar and echo etc  i am not sure why  for devotees the mono versions have always been considered superior for this reason  i was hoping that with todays technology a truly good stereo mix could be made  after all there is software now that allows one to isolate a voice or bass line to create a new and separate track from a mono recording so theoretically new  truly stereo mixes could be made  this technique was used to create the beatles rockband game after all and i expected much more from these new releases  after listening to this new stereo version there are no improvements to the original poorquality stereo mixes at all and i have no idea why they didnt take the time to do it while george martin paul and ringo are still here  maybe there is still some technological problem that i am unaware of but they have done marvelous things with the yellow submarine songtrack so i was expecting a lot more  when the beatles catalogue was first released on cd george martin decided to release the first four albums in their original monophonic form because that is how they were intended to be heard by he and the beatles and the existing stereo mixes sounded terrible  unfortunately that is still the case hereall that was done here as far as remastering that i can tell is that the loudness is turned up and the bass is louderor boomier depending on your taste  two tracks are very offensive and it bothers me to no end that these nasty versions may now become the standard  first is if i fell which for some reason has an inferior vocal track in which pauls voice glaringly cracks on the high note of was in vain  this flaw is not present on the mono mix  also there is too much echo on johns solo introductionit sounds like he is in a cave somewhere  the other offense is i should have known better in which the harmonica cuts out as if john were out of breath in the introduction  this again is not present in the original monophonic versioni will continue to listen to my old mono cd instead of this one  although monophonic to many connotes an inferior quality they really sound quite crisp and cleanit is just that the same sound comes out of each speaker  there is no tinnyness that one associates with very old recordings from say the 1940s  in fairness the packaging on this new series is first rate and makes the buy almost worth it but when i think of what couldve been achieved i am left scratching my head except to think that they want to release the catalogue again later on in some still more improved versioncuriously i do find some of the stereo versions superior on other beatle albums  for example from me to you is much better in stereo because the harmonica at the beginning has been removed  i always found the old mono version to be irritatingly piercing  i call your name has a more nimble and musical lead guitar line from george and thank you girl has more harmonica echoing the line too good to be trueso i enjoyed the new remastered past masters  however paperback writer still begins annoyingly on just the left speaker until the drums kick inthis particular ablum is made much worse in the stereo version  i would not buy this unless you want the packagingi am quite bothered that they would make no effort to improve these stereo mixes which everyone knows stink and simply remaster this junk  i can only predict a yet more improved release 20 years down the road i was bummed out|0
only 3 songs here none of which are among their best production values are nominal as you might expect from a bbc session for the completist only get the rest of their catalog anyway fearless in particular before you spring for this one|0

i saw rush live on this tour ive been listening to rush and to classical music for over 35 years im an avid classical music listener rush is one of my top favorite rock bands i did not like the inclusion of a string section violins cellos etc classical music instruments with rush music many musicians believe that eclectic and creative mixes of musical instruments genres and styles will produce great musictrue it does work many times it did not work this time in my very personal opinion and for my taste the strings sound out of place and forced onto the rush music and geddys singing it sounds as if i were listening to rush on one rock radio station and a classical music station was interfering with rush five of the songs on this disc are performed with the clockwork angels string ensemble otherwise id give 5 stars|1
bought this because we saw slash with myles kennedy on a guitar special on tv  they were terrific  acoustic stuff they plugged this cd  we assumed it would contain what they did on tv it did not it is all electric loud repetitive headbanger metal they could do good acoustic stuff if they chose but apparently they did not|0
ooops  amazoncom the onestar is for your poor product information  this cd wonderful as sir colin is turned out to be the incomplete opera you need to publish that the 66 sir colin one includes the libretto and is complete incomplete includes all arias but no libretto or recitatives highlights include only the popular arias or greatest hits of that operaright now your website is confusing with the multiple recordings of a given workthank youcynthia decuir|0
i bought this so that my husband and i could start singing to your baby and although our child is an infant but she already enjoys hearing these songs as evidenced by her smiles when me or my husband sing along or sing the songs at another time this is a great collection of songs for kids and parents|1

did not seem that it was professionally recorded the recording quality was terrible  you could not understand the words  very disappointed ended up thowing it away|0
i fully agree with the first reviewer who heard a version of this contata on public radio and then bougght the rifkin one from amazon i too bought it and was disappointed i would love to know who recorded the version we both heard on public radio cant seem to find it|0
i went looking for music from this composer because of a pretty piece i heard on classical radio recently this cd was not at all what id hoped for first of all whoever mixed this did a piss poor job you have to turn the volume way up just to hear anything too much mid level not much high and no low bass at all one of the poorest audio quality cds ive heard in awhile as for the music most of the pieces selected just arent really all that interesting i ended up only liking the piece that originally prompted me to buy this all around a very diappointing purchase|0
not the funniest of the nichols and may albums this is the duos first cd it consists of various piano pieces which they use as a springboard to launch into improv sets none of them really made me laugh out loud but  more than one are oddly touching recommended for enthusiasts|0
i recieved the wall as a christmas gift from a friend being assured that it was one of the greatest rock albums ever produced he was right the walls music is some of the best i have ever heard along with the  fragile by nine inch nails what is really striking about the music  though is the incredible complexity of styles presented on the wall  from the acoustic guitardriven mother to the orchestral  pieces nobody home and the trial as well as the  amazing electric guitar solos in such songs as comfortably  numbbut what really makes the wall stand out from other albums  is the story and the ideas behind the music the wall is about mans  struggle against himself and against society if this sounds pretentious  its because pink floyd took a gamble as to whether they could make a great  rock album with depth to it and they succeeded pink floyd is able to  capture the rage hate and alienation from society that afflicts modern  man aside from pink floyd the only modern artist to explore these issues  and not fail to express them properly is trent reznor of nine inch nailswhere floyd beats reznor soundly though is the lyrics department  dont get me wrong the downward spiral and the fragile have some great  lyrics on them yet the overall quality of songs like mother  hey you another brick in the wall pts 13 and  goodbye blue sky is better than anything reznor has done  still for those interested in the sort of ideas that make up the wall i  strongly recommend the downward spiral and the fragile by nine inch  nails|1
while the cd arrived promptly there were scratches on the cd that caused the music to skip  i tried cleaning the cd but to no avail|0
in many ways this album reminds me of pierre martiques haunting le  bin de vous beauchamp in that  reaches the depths of the soul of a  human in dire need this album shows watters genius|1
with 250 other gj cds to choose from this is an easy pass about 8 of the 10 tracks were clearly copied at the wrong speed sounds like someone putting their thumb on the turntable seriouslythe only gj cd in my 50 collection i regret purchasing youve been warned|0
ever since several performers from hawaii came to the national folklife festival in east lansing mi several years ago i have been longing to listen to well sung traditional hawaiian chantingsongs  this cd has it  but only three or four tracks of it  if this were a record lp there would be hills and valleys on it by now slack key guitar makes me ill and i avoid those tracks like the plague but the traditional chants are exceptionally well sung and make this cd one of the few that i return to over and overmost of the other cds that i have encountered having music of this type are either antropological or poorly sung or include the skg i dont want to even write it again  the few tracks on this cd that are of merit are worth playing over and over again|0
the wall 1979 pink floyds eleventh studio albumduring the 1970s pink floyd had a phenominal run of classic albums it all started with 1971s meddle which was the first album which exhibited the classic floyd sound the following albums the immortalising dark side of the moon wish you were and animals proved the band were on the top of their game with every album the band pushed musical boundaries and explored new sounds whilst at the same time defying current trends such as punk which were out to render the band obsolete to the current music scene however in the midst of these newly scaled heights the bands stability and cohesiveness was far from great from wish you were here onwards bassist roger waters began to take over the songwriting more and more forcing the other band members contributions to be minimal as a good a writer as waters was this was not good for the bands chemistry still however when the wall hit the stores in 1979 it was a massive hit and has gone on to be one of the bands biggest selling albums the question is just how well does the bands multiplatinum selling concept album workalthough this for me is not pink floyds best album the wall is a literally awesome album however it is also a work which takes a number of listens to fully appreciate this is not surprising as aside from the well known staples from the album such as another brick in the wall part ii and comfortably numb many of the songs are snippets of a larger concept which hangs loosely together the wall is a concept album based around the life of a rock star and the troubles and loss of direction he suffers the concept doesnt hang together amazingly well and may not even be spotted by the unsuspecting listener however there is no denying the amazing ambition that pink floyd exhibit in this album which is enough to glue the work into the classic it is recognised as indeed as other reviewers have stated the album as a whole is greater than the sum of parts the wall pushes so many boundaries it seems to good to be true this is all the more remarkable given that it is mostly the work of one man roger waters musically the album has plenty of solid classic bass lines and some great guitar moments from david gilmour such as in comfortably numb and in the flesh although the efforts from rick wright and nick mason at times seem muted in no part due to being shoved out of songwriting the simple drum beats and keyboard interludes add greatly to the overall ambience of the record the album succeeds in sustaining the listeners interest right over its 80 minute run time and shapes up to be a great epic this is truly pink floyds last classic workboth sides of the album feature a large number of songs some long and some short snippet styled songs which form the albums concept disc 1 for the album kicks off with in the flesh which has a quiet start before a rip roaring guitar entry from dave gilmour the song shapes up to be a hard hitting rock staple which sets up the album nicely the thin ice is an acoustic lyrically cynical follow up and another brick in the wall part i has muted guitar and pent up energy bubbling beneath the surface the happiest days of our lives has some snarling vocals from roger waters musically the song sets the scene perfectly for another brick in the wall part ii the famous hit song this song is definitely not overatted the childrens chorus chant is classic and innovative and gilmours guitar exit is phenominal the stripped down acoustics mother is next up this 5 minute song is very underrated has some clever climatic moments and some great lyricsthe second half of cd 1 kicks off with good bye blue sky a slow introspective song with a classic floyd pacing to it empty spaces follows incorporating forboding mechanical sounds at the start and a short waters lyrical interlude next up though is one of the best tracks on the album in young lust great guitar riffs and a catchy dirty woman chorus are great gilmours guitar work screams through the tapestry of the song one of my turns is next the song starts with a short interlude depicting the rock star in the concept drifting out of consciousness the song builds into a song with a typical floyd groove with dispairing lyrics dont leave me now is a downcast interlude and another brick in the wall part iii is a reprise of the earlier song in a different style goodbye cruel world is a short narrative song to close the first half of the albumcd 2 kicks off with the slow and stately but mightily effective hey you an atmospheric song with a classic floyd bass line and great introspective lyrics following this a linking track in is there anybody out there with plenty of noise effects which is then followed by nobody home which is a slow lyrical yearn with the rock star in the album concept searching to find his place in the world vera is a short theatrical sounding follow up track and bring the boys back home is a dramaticised track both these songs filler songs really are the backdrop though to the greatest song on the album yep you guessed it comfortably numb 6 minutes of pure genius the song is slow and stately but captivating and empowering the orchestral backing gives the song a great edge and the lyrics are great gilmour excels yet again in his guitar solothe second half of cd 2 starts with the show must go on which is a nice semiharmonised song a welcome reprise of in the flesh follows and then a great storming track in run like hell with bursting guitars and stomping bass lines waiting for the worms and stop keep the albums concept going with more pleading lyrics the trial is an interesting and rather amusing song this song is the trial going on inside the rock stars head as he tries to get other his troubles some of the voice overs are quite funny the song ends with chants of tear down the wall before it fades into a low key closing track in outside the wall which wraps up the albums conceptso as you might gather from my run down of the albums songs some of the tunes are a bit odd and need to be appreciated in context however this album still has some amazing songs which are some of the bands best and the sheer ambition that the album holds keeps the whole thing together the wall is an immensely popular effort from the band and i personally would rate it up there with the bands other classic efforts if your new to the floyd get dark side of the moon and wish you were here first if you like those and im confident that you will then get the wall as youll be sure to enjoy it highly recommendedmy rating 910|1
this guys a loserand he knows itthats what makes this guy so funny|1
let me preface this by saying that touch is one of my alltime favorite cds ever  i bought this cd several years ago  i played it exactly twice  it became a frisbee  the vocals singing were pathetic  its a stretch of the imagination to say that it resembles a marketable recording  if you buy it put your earmuffs on cause you aint gonna like it|0
probably a lot of hallucinogen fans doing reviews hereit is not bad not at all but i dont think this record has it when you listen to goa you want this final touch and hallucinogen dont has ita very talented artist but  not enough|0
the cover picture on the cd indicated early rudy but this was a mismash of the decades  if the cuts had been chronological it would have been better but they werent and there are no liner notes indicating when any of the songs were recorded if you want 50s rudy youre better off getting as time goes by a 56 reissue or heighho everybody this is rudy vallee it contains cuts from 2830 which is my favorite|0
the wall is the first cd i bought in my life my mum had brought me to the cinema the movie we wanted to watch was not on display anymore so here we were wondering if we would go back home then my mum said weve been driving all the way to the cinema it would be a pity to go back now lets watch this movie this movie was the walland it was such a revelation i was 13 and i didnt understand english at all actually im french but it was such a blow so intense so deep so powerful after watching the movie i had only one idea  buying the cda few days later i was entering the cd shop what a suprise when the seller told me that it was a double cd and therefore a double pricei still remember the price  250 francs about 40 euros and when you are 13 years old 250 francs is quite a lot of moneyanyway i bought the cd it was 22 years ago i still have it i still listen to it i love it like in the first daypink floyd is not only music they definitely have something that goes behind normal music and that manages to touch a very deep thing that lies in usbuy the cd and enjoy|1
this cd jams beginning to end a love it looking for their next release condition of product very fine shipped in a week no problem would use amazon again|1
any one who likes anytype or rock or desent guitar playing shouldnt get this cd its just so cheesy it ruins all these christmas classics|0
i saw the movie when i was in hs back in the 80s and have always enjoyed the songs when they come on the radio  i decided to finally buy the cd and im not disappointed  even my kids enjoy the music  we especially like how can you eat your pudding if you dont eat your meat  we dont need no thought control  pink floyd has stood the test of time  i ended up purchasing dark side of moon too|1
i listened to this cd while on a four day drive i hate driving but the miles flew by it may or may not have been a good idea to listen to it though my husband said i was swerving from laughing so hard|1
that first review pretty much sums up the whole the wall album theres not much i can add except just this is a slow paced but enjoyable musical experince this is well worth getting and is actually my first pink floyd cd and is a good introduction to them i highly recommend it to people who like classic rock as the music is very soft played so no head thrashing|1
you know what would be funnier than pachabel in the woods or pachabel with whale noises or pachabel with the sounds of the rainforest in a snowstorm on a july day with a couple camels giving birth pachabel in taco bell i would buy that cdid just like to point out the fact that pachebel is far and away the worst most overrated most boring classical piece ever written  and if it wasnt before it has been played so much on so many occasions with so many stupid accompaniments yes this includes with whale noises that it is now  you want a beautiful piece  i give you barbars adagio for strings  i give you meditation from thais  ill even give you sentimental sappy garbage like tchaikovskys romeo and juliet  just please for the sake of good taste everywhere put down that pachebel cd|0
imagine that you were watching a show and that it was being tapedwell it sounds like that  characters are talking and then they burst into song or stop to discuss something  dont like this at all  purchase some other songs better|0
first off let me just say that a 4 star rush album is the same as a 5 star anybody else  if you are a fan you know what i mean  i would have given it 45 stars but no way to do thatpeople love to give longwinded flowery reviews so they can sound like they work for spin or rolling stone  dont want to do that  just wanna get to the pointive followed rush through all of their changes  ive never heard a bad rush album but i still dont get vapour trails  its the only one since 1978 that i dont ownanyway i heard caravan and bu2b when they toured a couple of years ago they had already written them and released them  they grew on me  i really like caravan  bu2b is really good as well  dont agree with the antireligion bent but its a good song and i get itanyway imo caravan bu2b seven cities of gold and headlong flight are the best songs on the album  i really like headlong flight its a rocker as are the other 3 i mentioned the bass is fast and furious especially on headlong flight and seven cites of gold saw them do most of the album in concert a few weeks ago and headlong flight was the highlight of the new stuffthe album to me sounds like a cross between snakes and arrows and counterparts  it has a deep driven sound most of it and the riffs really remind me of stick it out  i think counterparts is way underrated btw  regardless i really like the sound of clockwork angels  the wreckers is nice a little slow but good harmonies  i know the garden is a favorite of some  there are kind of two rush camps those who like the hard stuff and those who like all of it  personally i love some of the easier stuff like bravado time stand still etc  that being said i really like the first four songs i mentioned a lot better  the slower stuff is good but it just doesnt grab me the only thingbad i can say about the album is that some of the songs sound pretty similar  i guess after 15 or so albums its  hard to make all of them that differentclockwork angels is a rocker imo  if you liked counterparts andor snakes and arrows i think youll like it  45 stars|1
i think im in the minority when i say that i far preferred the idea of the last album  it was great hearing slash play with so many different artists and in particular the different styles  i even liked the miles kennedy stuff the best  but a review of this album almost comes down to a judgment of miles and whether or not you like him  and in my opinion hes great in moderation  there are definitely some great tracks on the album and slash is amazing as always  i gave it three stars right off the bat because slash could roll out of bed and manage that much  but i could only give miles the one additional  this is a solid album that should be in any hard rock collection  but it aint greati am an axl rose fan in a huge way  but my main concern isnt because of that fact  i just think that miles has a sound too close to axls  velvet revolver worked so well because scott weiland had such a different sound and there never was a reason to compare the two  but with miles i hear enough similarity that i cant help but compare  and it doesnt go in his favor  it isnt his fault and i dont hold it against him  but i dont think hes a good fit for slash on a continuing basis  it reminds me of coverdalepage  theres nothing wrong with david coverdale  the man can rock  but he is just too similar to robert plant for jimmie page to be playing with him and it only lasted one album  i think the same applies here as well|1
what a tub of lard i dont see how anyone could listen to this record with pleasure it is an assault on all which faithful musicians and composers hold dear to them just take a look at the score while youre listening to this music and youll see my point for starters this is one of the longest performances of beethovens 9th on record the first movement is 18 minutes long and the 2nd almost 11 with a repeat omitted the third movement is an astounding 20 minutes long bernstein takes this literally at half tempo as he always does with important adagio movements that have much to exploit and then comes the big finale  28 and a half minutes all told  a 78 minute long symphony average performances clock in at about 70 minutes faster performances which follow beethovens metronome markings are about 60 minutes long so bernstein was just a little slow eh sure two minutes longer and deutsche grammophon wouldve had to market this performance using two cds and what a pity for them they would have made a killing off of it for surethats just the tip of the iceburg rhythmic intensity and accuracy are thrown completely out of the window everything is blunted to a fault bernsteins pickup orchestra some of the best musicians from the best orchestras in the world lose their footing because they are not used to beating beethoven about the head as bernstein has them do here there are numerous mistakes  some are noticeable some are more hidden these folks do not play as an ensemble and who would expect them to with all the different styles present one might expect that bernstein faced with this dilemma might be sensible enough to give them some direction as to how to articulate similarly  or at all for that matter not the case here he just trusts that everyone will understand how things go attempting to hammer out something resembling a phrase through sheer force of will the orchestra responds with careless and sloppy playing harmonic progressions are lost amidst a sea of angry robotic ostinatos there is no shape or balance to the music the poetry is gone bernstein gesticulates and says here you go be inspired but they dont know how on the rare occasion that a bit of unique and interesting music is made it is completely out of context and of a character not suited to this symphonyanother side effect of lousy direction is one of the most complete structural collapses in the history of the 9th how fitting considering what is being commemorated here bernsteins failure to acknowledge this symphony as more than just a bunch of spliced 2measure character pieces wreaks havoc on the musicality there is no forward drive no anticipation of the next musical idea that blooms from the previous one there is no continuity the fire dies oh but wait the other reviewers would say there is much fire in these performances just listen to the climaxes heavens what energy well bernstein inciting his musicians to play extremely loudly does not equate with a real energetic performance a string quartet could play with more intensity than this lost group bernstein doesnt stoke up the fire but instead sears us in the back with a hot branding ironthis recording can be summed up as being retrograde instead of setting free emotions and thoughts of joy and freedom this performance inhibits them im not sure how the berlin audience could get through the concert without crying from sheer boredom and irritation i see no joy here only a languid aggravating and oppressive mishmash of bad execution and bad interpretation you may certainly buy this because of the occasion but what is the point of celebrating if the music itself wont even let you do that dont waste your time on this|0
i was searching for a specific tune  the songs listed on this website and on the cd cover case are not what are on the cd  i was extremely disappointed  any true german would know this when they played the cd  i was even more upset that since i opened the cds i was unable to return them  if you are looking for some of these tunes try the cd german music fest|0
this is my favorite petra albumit rocks the sound is great and the lyrics are even better the spiritual warfare theme continues from this means war into this album by far their best album|1
even though this was from 1989  i have just recently heard it on christian radio  sharred 1 song withnmy womens bible study and had numerous people come up to and ask me where it came from  amazoncom  cheap  or if you are sckeptical look up the song gloria in excise this deohark the herald angles sing michael w smith christmas album  this is one example of what is on the cd|1
this is a great cd i have always loved brians super delivery of humorbut wheres the video  i remember having seen a video of this same material on tv or vhs entitled mrs regan theres something wrong with your sonwhat ever happeded to that  brian help me out i know im sixtyfive but im not senialesp takeluck tito|1
this is quite possibly the most wierd and psychadellic album i have ever heard there is nothing quite like it pink floyd has a sound all his own i agree with him when he says we dont need no education teachers  leave them kids alone|1
simply put this is a masterpiece and it tells a story as well as paints a picture  one of the defining rock opuses that extends the creativity and talent of the members of pink floyd  i have to mention though that this is roger waters baby he is the godfather of this project as well as wish you were here and dark side of the moon  make no mistake about it waters songwriting bass playing and singing was the center that did hold for a long long time for this bandthe wall is epic so large nobody can touch it  it is something that takes a lifetime to truly experience and understand and even then you are amazed at how it just continues to grow and change while still showing some of the same things hold true years and years later  some of the songs really seem like nothing more than toe tapping rockers but if you know the story then you know the depth that is behind those songsone of the greatest dual album studio releases of all time  forget the cartoon and the drugs and all that other hocus pocus and just soak this in one day at a time for a lifetime  you wont regret it it will one day be your baby also  they just dont make records like this anymore with so much meaning and feeling and power and social and political ideas all melded into one thingand that thing is the wall by pink floyd|1
ah brian regan the bastian of clean comedy in america whether hes family friendly or not  the question of clean comedy vs dirty comedy and right and wrong isnt what goes on in my head and i pity those who think its about that and i know there are more than a few in his audience  there are funny comedians on both sides of the fence and regan is squeaky clean which makes me look at him differently  kevin james is largely clean and others are clean and lame but whats wrong with having a few jokes that dont fly with little kids and when was standup comedy about universal appeal or understanding  taking these things into account i understand where regan is coming from being from a middle class protestant household with history in mennonite  he strays from anything that would be impolite crass rude or unappealing to anyone within earshot because the most impressionable and sheltering audiences run at the first sign of dissent not to mention a dangerous tone of voice this results in his comedy being akin to clown shoes a prop that serves no purpose in the service of comedy to others more accustomed to personalized comedy it comes off as less than honest even when he talks about himself or his family  to me hes not funny at all  even comedians i cant relate to are funnier it just seems that he boxes himself in rather than being himself and in the process he cant reach profound comedy or entertaining humor at all outside of this sheltered audience  if youre an adult and you like regan i have no interest in hearing your tastes apart from him hes that bad to me on this cd  this started it all and ive seen his specials on tv thinking he must pick something funny off of the road and hes always terrible worse even  to those who love comedy and like to see clean done well stay away from this man hes killing the game|0
with this 1994 reissue of his 1986 lp way back home phil violates a rule i wish i could impose on musicians when putting out the only cd version of any given album you can add bonus tracks but otherwise dont mess with it here phil has heavily revised several of the songs from wbh generally making them more strippeddown and occasionally shorter the only track that gets at all improved in the process is maker of the universe the rest range from suffering slightly to getting downright ruined a few songs dont seem to have been changed noticeably but these were generally relatively weak songs to begin withof course wbh was never phils best album in the first place part of this is because of a common weakness in phils output songs whose lyrics delve too much into specific personal detailsthe four new songs here are a mixed bag the best is it could have been me although it doesnt fit the albums tone at all shes a dancer is mccartneyesque  ok fatherdaughter harmony is sappy in the extreme and the 50th while fitting the toopersonal criteria it includes excerpts from a homemade vinyl recording of his grandparents 50th anniversary celebration in 1948 is still musically pleasant and historically interesting btw phils acoustic sketches has a version of this with the music only minus the old record excerptsget it if youre a phil fan but first see if you can get someone to put the original vinyl to cd for you btw the original cover was a lot better too|0
if you want a quality christmas compilation dont buy this cassette  i chose it for the reputation drews famous has for good dance mixes but upon playing this tape i could not believe how cheesy the remakes were  ughhghghh  the sound is like a garage band screeching away on guitars the voices are straight out of voice class 101 and for the price i paid i should have saved my money for a more professional collection of hits|0
buy this from amazon onlyno 3rd parties the first one i bought 34 mos ago had a crack in plasticbig scratch amazon gave me a refund promptly without returning  my husband still wanted it so when i looked this time i see amazon was selling it  had the ss shipping  we recd it  it was in good condition|1
this is where the band began to truly unravel and it brought out the best in two of them rick wright was largely absent and keyboards were played by several credited and uncredited musicians nick mason was replaced on drums by jeff porcaro for at least one song  roger is the chief musical and lyrical force but gilmour brings his a game to the table especially on comfortably numb and run like hell two songs he cowrote  an excellent starting point for the newbie pf fan|1
i bought it and it was defective  returned for replacement and second one that was sent was defective  very unhappy  looks like it would be a fun cd for my grandaughter so i was most unhappy that im left with a defective product|0
after reading reviews here youd think this wasnt only the floydians best album but the greatest album ever  would the greatest album ever have 5 techincally 4 songs well yes if all of those songs are classics  that is not the case here1 shine on you crazy diamondthe song itself is pretty good but why do we have to wait 5 minutes for it to get here absolutely nothing gets accomplished in the beginning and it actually hinders the song severely  its easy getting to the good part on itunes or wmp but if you want to listen to it on your ipod or a cd then fast forwarding every time can be real annoying  otherwise you may be asleep by the time the good part kicks off2 welcome to the machineabsolutely dreadful song  nothing is more painful to the ears than thewhatever that is in the background  its not much of a song and has barely any melodies3 have a cigaraverage song  not too good but not the musical holocaust that welcome to the machine was4 wish you were herethis is a very good song and earns this cd a star all by itself  great tune and one of pink floyds best5 shine on you crazy diamond part twoeven worse than the first part  this song isnt interesting enough to split into two but i guess they needed some material to fill up this cdthere you go  out of the 5 techincally 4 songs the only one worth writing home about is the title track  and thats what we have limewire for|0
the song way out there was done back in the 40s by the sons of the pioneers a group of singing cowboys that once included roy rogers they would sing and yodel in 4 or 5 part harmonies they were amazing but mostly forgotten now a days|0
not much of a tribute album  there are tracks here that dont really have  anything to do with vangelis or jarre  and none of the actual cover songs  are radically different from the originals except that they lack what made  them special in the first placeif you are really interested in the work  of vangelis or jarre buy a cd or two that they actually wrote and  performed|0
im a huge pink floyd fan and i honestly think theyre the best rock n roll band ever from 1970 to 1983 they released one masterpiece after another and roger waters is definitely among the few people that can be considered a songwriter geniusnow about the album what else is there to say is the 3rd bestselling album in usa history with 23 million copies sold as a matter of fact this number is bigger as the last time that riaa updated the numbers from this album was in 1999the mixing is astonishing is at the same level of audio quality that any digital album released nowadays just crystal clear the package is really deluxe and the music and lyrics are perfectjust look to the ranking of sales in amazon right bellow the product information the last time i saw it was in the top 100 this album is timeless|1
interesting storyline would loved to see a deeper exploration on the underlying themewhat were the implications for the parallel universe the characters were enjoyable a little to one dimensional enjoyable and thought provoking but felt as if there could be more to it maybe a relapse of the field in a sequel |1
my question is what were grp thinking when they released this im not a fusion junkie but i enjoy it occasionally this is not one of those times great players appalling outcomei know it must be a spyro gyra related episode maybe even an mca buyout related episode but the best recommendation is that they didnt repeat it|0
just the garden alone is worth the purchase thebest song they have ever made in my humble opinionwould love to hear a full album of songs in this stylewould rival the best albums of all time|1
first my bona fides  ive been a rush fan since 1980 ive been to see them live every year theyve performed since the mid 80s without missing a tour  has anyone noticed the crazylooking siek with the turbin who has been front and center at their concerts for the past few years ive got a really cool starman tat on my right shoulder i named my son geddy and yes i do listen to other bands besides rush pmost rush albums had to grow on me i can remember listening to power windows and getting this feeling in the pit of my stomach that they were losing it then the next listen i noticed the really sick guitar licks in the big money then the next listen i emotionally connected to middletown dreams and felt a little sad  in all of their albums the initial uneasiness upon the first or second listen was eventually replaced with adoration and respect i frequently listen to caress of steel which is supposedly their worst albumnot so with this album i immediately recognised it as their finest work to date the casual rush fan probably doesnt get the story of the album a young mans journey through life with its trials setbacks devastation and finally redemption a novel is following shortly and i cant wait to read when  doubleentandre is a standard peart lyric writing tool  the album can also be taken as rushs journey through life and it certainly has meaning to me personally as many of its themes reflect my own disappointments with my life ive lost my religion my country and my selfrespect being a service academy grad who has been working construction for  the past two decades kind of hammers your selfesteem  when i was listening to this at my manly construction job i literally teared up while listening to the garden ive got my own garden to tend to a wife and two kids a measure of a life is a measure of love and respect so hard to earn and so easily burned then alex wailed and my throat closed up i have a blessing at home i have the love and repect of three wonderful people and it doesnt matter what i do for a living i wont be remembered for that ill be remembered for the way you live the gifts that you give that song is the most beautiful song theyve ever producedall of us old guys are starting to feel our mortality and are reflecting on a life that is almost done  i think this is why this album touches me  it wont be long before we all go into the great beyondor we go to where we were before we were born not existing rush has been my constant companionone a happier note the bass in the anarchist makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside the way alex and neal take off running like threelegged racers running a 420 40 yard dash at the beginning of said song boggles my mind given that these guys are turning 60ishmy broinlaw also informed me that he spent the day all choked up while listening to the album i guess its an album for old guys|1
i have no idea what the words are but the music uplifts me like a meditation  i will purchase a lot more of this mans music and the seller was great|1
album oriented music refers to the idea that an album should not be evaluated on the basis of any single selection but on the basis of the collection as a whole  it was a notion that went handinglove with the idea of concept album in which every single selection was in some way related to every other selection in the collection  rock opera which involved piecing together selections to create a narrative was not too terribly far behindand a double album release was considered a test of creativity prestige and the ultimate marketing coup  all four of these were signature ideas of 1970s popular music and all four reached a final critical mass pink floyds 1979 the wall which put a punctuation mark to decade before the onrush of the excessive synthesizers and flashy music videos that characterized much of the 1980smost bands go through cycles in which the musical ideas of one particular bandmate overrides those of the othersand in the late 1970s pink floyd fell under the nearabsolute domination of roger waters  originally given to psychedelia and progressive styles and often tinged with a certain meloncholia pink floyd became darker still with the 1979 the wall the ultimate result  so ultimate in fact that waters left the band shortly thereafter declaring that pink floyd had run its course as it happened he was greatly mistaken although he was no longer a part of it the band continued on with significant successalthough it received broad critical approval and sold extremely well the wall was not immune to criticism even in 1979  then as now it was a work that you either really liked or dislikedand a good many of those who disliked it were pink floyd fans who had been so enthusiastic about the band up to that point  it was they complained musically bloated and the story it told was trival  i myself eighteen when the wall was first released was not particularly enthusiastic about it and for exactly those reason  over time however my opinion has shiftedit is indeed musically bloated  i suspect this actually arises from the techology of the day  in 1979 record buyers expected each side of an vinyl album to run at least twenty twentyfive minutes and the entire album fortyfive minutes to an hour  anything less and the buyer felt shorted  even at this run time most albums contained significant filler songs that werent necessarily bad but which didnt measure up to the best of the cuts  it logically followed that a double album would have double the musicand there indeed are a number of points in the wall where one feels the music has been spread a bit thin with repetitions designed to meet the a of minutes the format requiredthe story is indeed trivialbut only if you regard it in the way you have been told to do so  when the wall was first released a great many critics focused on the narrative element and rushed to tell us all about it the wall is about a rock star named pink floyd  his father was killed in the war  his mother was suffocating  his school years were hell  his wife left him  the pain cuts him off from the world and now he uses drugs and alcohol that drive him into a personal chaos which he himself ultimately condemns  yep thats the wall  okay surebut the wall is not a narrative in the sense that it starts at point a and continues on to point z and if that is what you expect you are bound to be disappointed  it presents its events with a certain randomness touching upon one detailing another returning to the first flashing back and forth between traumas in what seems to be a druglaced and nightmarish confusion  the album famously opens with what can only be described as a classic stadiumrock soundonly to collapse suddenly into a plaintive often industrial sounding series of vignettes that speak of man and the machine  selections float to the surface of this wash mother goodbye blue sky young lust hey you nobody home comfortably numb run like hell all of them bitter angry despairing with snips of sound and phrases and melody that reference each other in much the way a tangled mind mightthe great failing of the wall at least in my opinion is in the last few minutes of the recording when the rock star suddenly jolts into a fit of selfevaluation and selfcondemnation in a seriocomic sort of way  ive always found this bit a little forced and i think the overall concept would have been better served with a more direct build toward the same anthemlike statement that opened the album  but i have to say that all things considered this is a trivial complaint while the wall may be flawed and while its easy to second guess the band that created it it hangs together remarkably exceptionally extraordinarily wellbleak  you bet  glitchy  and how  flawed  absolutely  does any of this undercut its singular value  not hardly  worth the cost  and then somegft amazon reviewer|1
this is not the original soundtrack from the movie a hard days night there are 4 instrumental songs that george martin conducted on the soundtrack 1 i should have known better 2 and i love her 3 ringos theme this boy 4 a hard days night why werent they on the soundtrack beats me he did a awsome job on these 4 songs how i know is that i have 2 vinyl soundtracks from the movie when it came out  the cd soundtrack by united artists cd cost me over 4000 dollars  import from japan so double check your purchases and see if these 4 songs are on the soundtrack take care|0
this album in my opinion relates more to my generation rather then to the generation of its release time most of the people i talk whom where alive when it was released dislike it alot saying that it is the worst of all of their albums but i think that is because they could no longer relate to it because everyone had played this idea out already people seemed tired of war and excitement so they were looking for something completely new and original hence the 80s the people of my generation have no problems relating to this album because we have nothing to stand up for nothing to fight for other then ourselves and this album is the epitome of that fight|1
this cd is banjo dynamite  alan exhibits his amazing style in which he combines the best of both scruggs 3 finger banjo rolls and melodic pickin style to produce a vibe ya just gotta hear to believe  all songs are performed without lyrics and with a focus on the banjo although the other bluegrass musicians on the cd are superb  i highly recommend this to anybody that plays or just loves 3 finger banjo|1
my wife was thrilled to get the cd until she played if and found track 5 skipping through the song  disturbing as i thought i was getting a new cd as ordered|0
since i not longer have a cassette player this is no value to mei threw it away having learned a very important lesion  be careful who you buy from i tried to be careful and still got caught  i caution all who read this to be very careful when you buy from a 3rd party source|0
more people know the name of bela fleck than stuart duncan but without taking anything away from bela it should really be the other way around  stuart sort of took the reins from mark oconnor another brilliant and betterknown fiddler in the late 80s and no one has seriously challenged him since  this record gives you a snapshot of stuarts playing when he was about halfway to his peak  thing is stuart halfway to his peak is still better than any other fiddler and he hasnt even peaked yet he just keeps getting better  theres great musicians on this record  bela sam vic wooten and particularly david grier doing some killer stuff  and the tunes are inventive  highlights for me are stuarts g forces which grinds that seventh chord wonderfully into your brain and the david mallett song summer of my dreams  instrumentalists of any kind pick this record up|1
ive seen all five of the teasers for this cddvd and im so excited about it coming out  all my favorite songs are on the cddvd from their album but their acoustic versions on here are like completely different songs  i hope there are some awesome videos and tons of acoustic versions which i think there will be  their acoustic versions are so awesome i can barely wait for its release im so excited about the poster geez lol im getting more excited the more i talk about its release the teasers got me all hyped up p|1
this guy is great  we were introduced to his comedy by a friend that played his recent dvd at a party  our family was instantly hooked  we bought his cd that was released years earlier and took it on a road trip to las vegas this summer  we had to have listened to that cd 5 times during the drive out and had loads of laughs every time  the first track is the best and sets the tone for the rest of the cd  buy it and enjoy it|1
this is the best rush album since the early 80smost diehard rush fans know that theres really not a bum album in the whole lot besides a couple of their early live albums which sound like they were to e sublime too drunk to light the bong too stoned to write the song and that horrific thankfully shortlived blunder into rap known as roll the bones but hey nobodys perfect this album is definitely one which gets better and better which each hearing these guys never cease to amaze me with their individual and collective talents  power trios rule|1
so you want a beatles greatest hits album  you see two old and one new compilations on the racks  the much toted beatles 1 or the red and blue albums respectively  reasoning it out you see both are double discs whereas beatles 1 is only a single disc  you want to know the sad part  beatles 1 is longer than both individually  why  because they want to stick to the original format supposedly  yeah whatever  i think its just to make more money off poor unsuspecting beatles fans or people looking for an introduction to the greatest band in rocknroll history you mean there are actually people who dont know the beatles entire body of work by heart  for shame  both of them clock in about 70 minutes whereas beatles 1 clocks in at just under 80 minutes  either they need to do one of two things1  expand the red and blue albums to actual double albums and slap about 30 more songs to each collection the white album is woefully underrepresented whereas seven of magical mystery tours 11 songs are on there2  add 4 or 5 songs to each respectively getting it as close to 80 minutes as you can and slap them onto a double disc set  that way instead of buying 4 discs when only two are needed you get two discs  the only problem here that will undoubtedly crop up is the tendency to slaughter the cover art on beatles records and these make nice contrasting pictures although the red is from please please meas far as the music goes so much has been written about the beatles what more is there to say  its all great stuff of course|0
lets get something straight from the beginning  this is not a pink floyd album the last true pink floyd album was animals because by the time of the wall in 1979 roger waters had taken over the band kicked out keyboardist richard wright and wrote almost all of the music  on the final cut the band had futher devolved from being a group to being waters solo project with guest players  dave gilmour made some contributions but only sang on one song and fought with waters constantly rick wright was kicked out of the band during the wall sessions and so doesnt appear and nick mason made only minor contributions to this sad dried blob of parrot droppings mason rightly decided that it wasnt worth it to continue in this charade of a bandpink floyds time had run out long ago but the corpse kept twitching long enough to create this their worst album the final cut is an exemplar of everything bad about concept albums and roger waters pretentions in particular the music is horrible overly theatrical selfconfessional and indulgent gloop that is both tremendously grating and cloying for the most part it consists of overwrought piano ballads with sound effects that sound nothing like pink floyd  not surprisingly since most of the floyd isnt on it  in fact much of this record sounds like gloomy show tunes the lyrics are maudlin and overly theatrical and have a similar facile theme to the wall ie war what is it good for  absolutely nothing  unfortunately tfc like the wall before it is all about the lyrics and the slight storyline theres not an ounce of bloody good music here overwrought depressing sentimentality combined with boring music is a crime for which there is no forgiveness especially when it was released under the name of what was one of the best and most far sighted bands of the sixties and 70s this is the bird poop on top of the tombstone that was the wall and is the worst most tedious and pretentious pink floyd album if you are a pink floyd fan whose first album was the wall you may like this turd otherwise avoid it as you would a rabid cat|0
i have always liked rush since i found out about them in 1978 with the release of hemispheres a buddy was already listening to them known through his older brother his brother took us to school one morning and was jamming to hemispheres i was hooked bought the album asap and began buying their other albums as well their music has a much different feel for me now days and it seems although the album is still good it lacks something that the members of rush had in the earlier days not disappointed in the album it is more or less my taste of music has changed as well because i have not heard a big winner from the last several albums from rush i may like a song or two but that will be it in the past i usually liked the entire album with maybe one or two songs that i did not like|1
theres a lots of good music here  i think that its worth a listen even if youre not a fan of aeon flux|1
chickenfoots second album iii continues what this band is about making some great rock music no genredefining or trying to top the heap this band and album are great fun but unlike the debut album some of this album overtones come off somewhat more darkerthemed not to say the whole album is like this theres plenty of sammys styled lyrics all over the place depending on what youre looking for in this album or band is just fun or almost embarrassing like the first album iii starts with a great rocker in last temptation lyrics dealing with somewhat religious feel another highlight different devil is a great sounding hagarstyled ballad if you appreciate hagars previous work in this vein youll sure to love this song other album highlights are up next come closer three and a half letters which contains some very appropriate for the common man lyrics for whats going on right now the first single big foot  dubai blues theres a hidden track at the end which has some very intereting lyrics somewhat powerful in the statement the music itself it pretty great sammy sounds great for his age michael can still throw down some nice bass work with chad laying down some nice beats and of course the great joe satriani on the axe but to be honest youd never know it especially on this album there are some great guitar parts but sounds almost as if hes not putting in his signature sound into chickenfoot but i guess you could say thats the point of a supergroup is to sound different from yourself and other bands for this rock supergroup chickenfoot shows that these veterans of rock can still produce great rock music in reflecting modern times|1
i have followed rush faithfully since 1980 clockwork angels is the most spirited effort since that era as a fellow musician i am still amazed by their musicianship if you have never seen them live dont miss out|1
i hope and pray the next evanescence cd flops so that we can stop seeing bands as obnoxiously bad as this surfacing  nothing original nothing intelligent quite simply nothing great about this album  personally i would rather have freshly sharpened pencils jabbed into my ears than to ever have to listen to this girls voice ever againsave yourself 12 dont but this|0
im a pink floyd fan ever since dark side of the moon w the  wizard of oz playing at the same time  and if i werent hit with one of  pink floyds bricks from his wall i wouldnt say they would be kickass  this album rocks from run like hell to whereever pink floyds  runnin to|1
one of the best progressiverock bands ever great music sound and lyrics as a true floydian i would recommend you to buy the dvd its absolutely brilliant trust me you dont know what youre missing and you wont regret it|1
i like every other song ok but the whole tone and orchestration is popsugarytoo sweet not at all like the pahinui brothers|0
regarding the success of this album and the ensuing tour david gilmour  once stated that the proof is in the pudding  this may be  true unfortunately however mr gilmour didnt write the recipe  in case  you have to ask that would be roger waters  this work and the  multimillion dollar produced concert tour that followed was perhaps the  most obvious instance of counterfeit ever in the history of rock music  from its wall the movie inspired cover with bob geldof clone and hotel  maid to its reliance on earlier floyd works for song titles  dogs of war a new welcome to the machine with this album  gilmour showed the world what a mediocre talent could do with a rock legend  and a record company willing to back anything remotely profitable  the  inspiration for this production was the child of some record executive who  said that gilmours first attempt at a floyd record didnt  sound like pink floyd  the album was immediately retooled and  writers were actually hired to help make a floyd album  what  they created was a soulless corporate product that bore the name pink  floyd but one that could not possibly live up to the floyd legacy  the  music is sterile and overproduced and the lyrics are thankfully  forgettable  only gilmours solos shine through as a stirring reminder of  a oncegreat guitarist  now in over his head as songwriter and  conceptualist  a couple of numbers stand out namely dogs of war and  learning to fly but their inane lyrics and subject matter the latter  about gilmour earning his pilots license  hinder repeat listenings  if  you make it to track 5 on the turning away gilmours attempt at social  conscience should send shivers the bad kind down your spine  nevertheless gilmour with mason and eventually wright in tow went on to  one of the most successful and profitable stadium tours ever attempted  armed with a back catalog of fm radio hits they didnt write or at best  cowrote a stage show conceived almost entirely by roger waters during  the bands heyday  circular projection screen inflatable pig etc and a  laser spectacular they wooed a new generation of fans who came to see a  legendary band and sadly probably never knew the difference  their  1994 followup the division bell followed the same formula with even  greater success  momentary lapse of reason indeed|0
slash makes his solo return with his second album apocalyptic love after listening to it a couple of times i think that it is a nice upgrade from his solo debut apocalyptic love has a more connected feel about it that better showcases slashs trademark nofills rock along with fine support from miles kennedy and the conspirators listening to the album it is very obvious how well they have gelled together after a lot of touring in the last yearoverall i highly recommend apocalyptic love to anyone that loves nofills balls to the wall rock|1
the whole family loves this brian regan cd unlike other comedy cds this is one we can play with our 8yearold in the car the language is very clean what the hell is as bad as it gets and the subject matter is very safebaseball donuts spelling bees monster truck pulls his voices are what make it so hysterically funny we still get a kick out of it even though weve listened to it 100 times already wish he would come out with another one|1
i just wanted to assure any adults who dread the idea of listening over and over to kids music to have no fear of john mccutcheon  this is intelligent and heartwarming fare for any age  im 50 and maybe  im a child at heart but songs like soup waiting for  snow and footsteps are balm for my soul  theres not a  single track you wont enjoy  promisewintersongs is part of a 4album  series and is my personal favorite  none of the four are bad this ones  great  and by the way hes a terrific live performer not only in  family concerts but in the grownup world as well  hes a 25 year veteran of the folk scene with as many albums to date and  a man of commitment and compassion  your kids and you couldnt ask for a  finer role model  do yourselves a favor and enjoy this talented mans  gifts|1
whatever your opinion of rush understand this this album is a monumental achievement in music history its the masterpiece that rush has threatened to release since 2112 that the clock on the cover reads 2112 in military time is not just a cute little trick look deeper and you realize that its a bridge back to the album where they first complained of the priests control over everyone the red cover evokes hold your fire and the excellent time stand still which is all about the passing of time and getting older i dont think i need to say any more about that if you delve deeper you will find many more connectionsi wont spoil it for youlet me close with this i dont know whats harder to accept the thought that rush could ever outdo this amazing record or the idea that they will never try in the meantime do yourself a favor take the time to understand and visit the clockwork universe|1
i heard la bottine souriante at the national folk festival in bangor maine this july and im listening to their cordial cd right now these guys are awesome especially the fellow who plays the feet in their particular blend you can see a swirl of styles from quebec folk to celtic to big band theyre an original high energy band that really deserves to be better known catch them where you can meanwhile ive got to go track down some more of their cds|1
these guys are my absolute favorite band the reason is they are from my hometown of fort wayne they got together in 1974 when i was 3 they will definitely be missed this is the only ccm band that never went secular if there is a band that can beat petra i have yet to see it they are like the ccm cinderella they can really kick your butt and break your heart but in a positive light  on fire mirrors that philosophy two of my favorite songs are on here are all fired up and hit you where you live another petra album i recommend is unseen power which is also in my collection rip guysyou deserve that retirement|1
this is without a doubt the greatest album ever if you live in a world of lullabies and skiffle  these lyrical geniuses as they are so often described are so soley because halfwits give meaning to their nonsensical  lyrics  its kind of the magic eye of musical lyrics  if you listen long  enough and ingest enough dope maybe youll find meaning in their words  after awhile that nursery rhyme entitled rocky raccoon should be renamed   the curious george goes to the saloon rag  but if ever  notice beatles fans are the same sheep that make it necessary for fast  food joints to offer value meals  simply they need to have someone else  decide what would be good to eat well i say this heres another pellet  for you if your crazy enough to buy it but we already know you will|0
all i can say is that this cd is simply awesome alex neil and geddy have truly created a masterpiece they never seem to lapse in creativity get it|1
i think these are taken from the 1960s columbia lps with a little more high end filtered out not good listening at all|0
i love this collection of raffis i started working at a daycare in august and cant find my old copies of these discs so i finally broke down and bot these again i bring it home every night so that it doesnt wander off to any other rooms in the school daycare the little darlings are dancing their little tushies off i tell you theyre 1 1 12 and are so excited to have music to go with the songs ive always sung to themraffis sinagable songs and more singable songs is great for kiddos|1
ill stay out of the debate about this album vs the new van halen album  i love them both in different ways and am glad to have them both added to my 800plus album collection this year  ill instead compare this album to the first chickenfoot album  both albums are excellent in my opinion but they are a bit different  the first chickenfoot album was very good but not quite what i expected from them at that time  it was full of grooves and some leftofcenter sounds and songs  this second album sounds like what i would have expected on a first album by them  the tracks are a little looser more straight ahead and probably a bit more mainstream sounding note that coming from me mainstream isnt always an insultim not one of those snobby antimainstream music listenersregarding this album joes guitar and sammys voice really come together in these songs  a good example of that is the third track a different devil  this is that certain type of rock anthem that the debut didnt havei love the melodies of this track  the opening track last temptation has a bit of that first album groovea very solid track  come closer at track six is that epic melodic ballad that the first album didnt havewhat a marvelous and heartfelt track  right after that at track seven comes a searing rocker bemoaning the financial plight of many in todays worlda song totally out of left field but that to me feels heartfelt and really works  i also enjoy the slamming blues riffs in up next and the haunting ballad closing song somethings going wrongthese guys all masters in their crafts really sound like a cohesive groupnot by any means some throwntogether project or supergroup  seeing them in concert a couple months back without chad smith who is of course on tour  with the red hot chili peppers further showcased their cohesiveness to me  sammy hagar will be 65 this year but still sounds great and shows little sign of slowing down or hanging it up  michael anthony can still play that bass and still provides awesome harmonic vocals both on recording and in person  and what can you say about joe satrianni  i obviously know what a legendary guitarist he is but was even more impressed after finally getting to see him live  he shreads in concert and i also love his playing on this albumi disagree with those who have called it too restrained for him  i hope these guys keep touring and put out at least another album or two  for sure this album is absolutely worth a listen particularly if you like that legendary lead singer and lead guitarist|1
i can sum this cd up in one word boring it is sometimes hard to get an idea of the songs from the 20 second music samples so i took a chance on this one wasnt what i had in mind i was looking for porn music more on the funky side this is more on the kennyg meets john tesh side|0
many people love this album so the consumer warning on my own review is that im expressing a minority view but the other consumer warning is this buy pink floyd but dont spend your hardearned on this double album it offers a lot of lyrics but not much music and even the best of that music doesnt have the unique brilliance that the best pink floyd offersits reasonable to make this consumer warning while acknowledging that there are a few good tracks amongst the dross because you can get the best tracks elsewhere the live in the flesh by roger waters and the live pulse by the other three offer the good tracks from the wall together with mostly good tracks from other albums but the wall offers its best tracks along with long expanses of filler plus abominations like bring the boys back home and the trialpink floyd were a great band who made genuinely brilliant strangebutexhilarating trailblazing music but while i play pink floyd quite often the wall is one of the albums i hardly ever take off the shelves along with the final cut momentary lapse of reason and the division bell and although the wall sold millions upon millions of copies i know im not the only pink floyd fan whos remained sceptical about its merits so why are so many floyd fans wall sceptics i think it comes down to three reasonsthe first problem is that the wallis musically very ordinary that is there was a time when pink floyd sounded like noone else on earth the sounds they got from their relatively primitive technology by todays standards still seem unearthly beautiful new strange sometimes scary and the compositions especially the longer tracks were as far from versechorusversechorusrepeatchorus rock as its possible to go weird creative mindenhancing stuff but in the wall pink floyd just sound like a rock band a good one but good in a workmanlike ordinary way to put this in perspective lets take the band queen i dont mind queen but i dont care about them either i cant imagine queen being capable of any of pink floyds music up until animals but i could quite easily imagine them coming up with something a bit like the wall queen to give them their due would have offered less selfpity and more humour that might not be enough to rescue the wall but it probably would have helpedthe second problem is that the wall is musically very ordinary the first time i was talking about their loss of a unique sound this time im talking about the very ordinary quality of most of the music here that is another brick in the wall is an okay songchant lifted into something genuinely interesting by a great bassline and comfortably numb and run like hell are two okay songs that get promoted to goodness by gilmours guitar mother and hey you are kind of okay but arent lifted higher than kind of okay but the rest falls into two categories endless recitative with waters voice whining and mumbling over mediocre playing by the other three and the trialas for the trial i once read that after releasing the final cut which was more like the last straw for those of us who used to expect vital music from pink floyd roger waters decided to sit down and listen to some andrew lloydwebber because final cut includes an insulting reference to lloydwebber waters was worried that it might turn out that cats or whatever it was had even a shred of merit in which case waters would have to feel bad about the insult so he was relieved to discover that lloydwebbers music was as he said utterly horrible in every way the trouble is roger i cant imagine queen coming up with something as utterly horrible in every way as the trial but i can imagine lloydwebber writing something like that and the trial is not just a track its a category of awfulness other tracks on the wall like vera and bring the boys back home fit into the trials category of utter horriblenessthe third problem is that the walls concept and lyrics are very ordinary the wall itself is a lazy metaphor too obvious to have any real force and a wall is lets face it not very interesting visually then theres waters selfpity or that of his character pink were supposed to identify with his whining but i  dont pink doesnt really exist as a character but the little we are told about him seems neither interesting nor likeableperhaps my problem is that i dont really give a toss about the problems of rich alienated rock stars there are many things i care about but not that nor do i like the subfreudian blamethemommies stick that waters mother comes in for i think julie burchill once recommended that mrs waters give her boy a slap for all the horrid things he says about her on this album but me i think that violence never solves anythingive been hesitating between two or three stars my decision to give it two is probably influenced by my feeling that this is pink floyd and so it ought to be betterbut if you do start your acquaintance with pink floyd with this album and find it mostly tedious dont write off pink floyd start elsewhere try meddle probably their best album despite some filler or the live disk of ummagumma dark side of the moon or even the stunning but atypical piper at the gates of dawncheerslaon|0
this must her first production it is noisy agitated and immature go for her other meditation cds instead those i can recommend they are much better in every way dont buy this one|0
as far as i know this is shirley verretts only studio recording of azucena  buy this recording just for that  she is slightly past her prime  her past her prime is still a thrilling achievementone star for the sonics  one star for the star of this recording shirley verrett|0
its really hard to call any album floyds best but this one may be my personal favorite some complain about it being so overthetop andor pretentious but in reality these aspects really serve to increase its brilliance rather than detract from it it is a unique album even by floyds standards most groups could not pull of such an ambitious project but floyd makes it work and then some waterss theatrical vocals and lyrics are ideal for the album and have become classic he is in top form on this dark masterpiece one of the greatest guitar players ever gilmour had wowed us all on previous albums but this is the one where he really out does himself the wall is a contender for best guitar album ever really every gilmour lick riff and solo is classic and sublime any guitar player that doesnt have this album needs it gilmour is just on another plane on this one|1
i have tried several times to listen to this cd and am tired of trying  im giving it away to a thrift storethe problem  the volume as recorded is way too low  i turn my playerampboomboxwhatever to about 95 volume to hear medium passagesits not worth the frustration  i hope this is an individual pressing error and not an attribute of every copy of this cd|0
viper was a relatively important band in brazil one to gett some international acclaim and that toured even in  japan but they had one dreadful characterictic when playing live they were some of the worse metal acts everanyway evolution was their last album of some merit afther that the band evern stopped to sing in english and went on to sing in their native language portuguese|0
my grandson loves these songs  he smiles and dances to the fun raffi songs just as his dad did at 4 years old|1
way informative  excellent historical and musical reflection  if you dont know what a rimfire saddleis you need to have this collection in your library|1
wasnt sure if i would like this band or this album but i am totally hooked i love the cd more every time i listen to it despite their getting a little too religious for me its still topnotch alternative metal or just plain music at its best|1
i wont breakdown and analyze each individual track but this album as a whole absolutely rocks if you are a rush fan and dont immediately love it you should keep playing it  because rushs musical brilliance is there if you are openminded enough to really listen for it if you are reading the reviews due to an indecision to buy clockwork angelsdont waste another day and just do iti believe that most people that download and buy only single tracks are cheating themselves because you must listen to clockwork angels from start to finish this is a concept style album which rush fans have come to enjoy and this is no exception so i strongly recommend having enough time to listen to clockwork angels in its entirety while most significant rock music artists of the last 40 years are nursing their careers with greatest hits tours and uninspiring new music rush hasnt lost their fire or creativity|1
the last real pink floyd album but i think that you get very tired if you want repeated listening|0
generally speaking this is a pleasantsounding wellrecorded disc with some catchy fast movements and some nice stringplaying if you own no other handel discs if you are a complete newcomer to baroque music if you couldnt tell a baroque oboe from adam and never heard of gut strings and if you havent the faintest idea what the german word affekt means then you might just enjoy this cd if however any of these criteria do not apply to you then i suggest you avoid this recording one of naxoss first attempts at baroque music recorded in may 1988 the capella istropolitana has in the meantime earned quite a positive reputation for itself but back then it still played its handel in a way that i thought died out in the 70s leadenly slow adagios heavyhanded strings no use of breaks or pauses no feeling for rhetoric or affekt sorry but thats the word incredibly lame tempi and modern instruments that seem incapable of producing 18th century atmosphere at least when they are played in such a romanticizing way as here with regard to the tempi i can give the timings for some alternative period instrument recordings op 6 no 4 handel  haydn society 951 capella istropolitana 1118 op 6 nr 5 concentus musicus vienna 1617 handel  haydn society 1421 capella istropolitana 1720 op 6 no 6 english concert 1600 handel  haydn society 1453 capella istropolitana 1731 similar strictures apply to op 3 no 3the tempi alone wouldnt be the problem of course but they are symptomatic of the oldfashioned unhistorical style of this recording|0

i am a great admirer of mozart and the first movement of the k 550 is perhaps the single most perfect moving inventive and shockingly beautiful piece of art since the birth of time it says molto allegro and bernstein for some inexplicable reason plays it much too slowly the dynamic power of this masterpiece is thereby terribly diminishedand it doesnt stop there the powerful and haunting third movement seems good at first but then some brass instrument takes the upper hand and ruins everything if theres one quality a conductor should possess apart from having the right tempo it is a thorough understanding of how the orchestra works and how perfect balance of instruments can be achievedthe last movement of the 40th is played faster than the first too fast even perhaps anyway it has the feeling of carelessly racing through the materialthen comes the much admired grand symphony no 41 the brilliant first movement joining the ranks of its brother in the g minor immediately sets off on the wrong foot by introducting some sort of fermata why i have no idea and again the orchestra seems awfully raw and unbalanced the sliding strings at the beginning are hardly heard over all the noisethen finally we come to the great schlussfuge final fuge another beautiful and ingenious composition the tempo is good but its the same story all over again with the orchestral colour the buildup in particular the bass entry at the beginning is clumsily handled and the fugal complexity is trashed by bernsteins unbearable racketi might have given this cd a higher ranking than just one star but the problem is that were talking about two divine miracles one of the most beautiful stream of dots and lines any man has ever been able to put on paper i hardly ever listen to the first movement of the 40th symphony because when i do i am drowned by the unstoppable urge to become a part of the heavens i never will i move my arms violently but can never match the intense emotion the restless fire and the ruthless power of the greatest symphonic achievement ever bernstein has attempted to translate the word of the gods and to do so as carelessly as this is unforgivable sacrilege|0
any album that gets well over 300 reviews at amazon twenty years after it has been released is surely an album that is not devoid of merit for me this is one of the truely great rock albums a remarkable effort  painstakingly shaped and conceived by one of the greatest rock poets even  if this album is partly autobiographical the insight in human nature is  razor sharpthe album tells the story of a boy losing his father in ww2  having to live with his dominant and overprotective mother going to school  to be bullied by teachers growing up to be married to an unfaithful wife  becoming a successful rock star and being unable to cope with the pressure   from which point it goes really downhill for him yet there is a note of  hope at the very end of the album there are people that really love him  he just shut them all outside his wallwaters doesnt paint a pretty  picture but he paints his grim view on humanity with master strokesthe  production of this album is absolutely flawless right down to the very  smallest of details at some point on the album the protagonist sits in a  hotel room and he is watching tv he makes a phone call to his wife who  doesnt answer the lyrics go something like when i pick up the  phone then there is just the background noise of the tv saying  surprise surprise surprise then the lyrics go on  theres still nobody home the attention given to the  production of an album shows in little things like this  the wall just  blows your mind when you pay the same attention while listeningone of  the nicest tricks is the circular form of the entire album it begins on a  very low volume with the words we came in it ends in the  same low volume two discs later with the words isnt this  where so you can start all over againgreat album a work of  art if you are into backstreet boys nsync and that kind of fluff steer  well away from this one this is music and it has something to sayi  should also mention the guitar playing by david gilmour his solo on  comfortably numb is one of the finest solos ever recorded|1
many people like dark side they call it floyds best album but that is a lie the wall is and it is one of the greatest works of the 20th century as many know it tells the story of pink and how he built his noexistent wall the lyrics and music waters and sometimes gilmour wrote is phenomenal the vocals are truly outstanding gilmour always shreds his guitar as usual ricks piano is electrifying mason provides an excellent beat in every song with drums and waters has some of his best bass lines this album is truly outstanding1010|1
this excellent set brings together three of raffis most enjoyable childrens albums into one great package all of the great raffi songs are here from robin in the rain through six little ducks and on to goodnight irene i first bought this set on cassette tape when my oldest was young and she loved singing along with raffi now with my youngest i needed them again on cd and this set was nicely pricedlike my older children my youngest loves these albums and sings along with all of the songs what more is there to say she loves the songs and i must admit that i like hearing them as well this is raffi at his best and well worth the price|1
to be sure there are some great songs on here but beware this music is not original  the backing music and the vocals come from different recording sessions  the vocals sound completely original and the quality is quite good but as you listen to the supporting music you realize that it must have been recorded in the past 10 years or so it just sounds too clear too new  there is electric bass and the percussion sounds too trebly when compared with the warm muted quality of the vocalsits not necessarily a bad thing if you dont listen that closely you probably wont be able to tell and the overall quality is great  however i couldnt get over feeling slightly cheated out of what i thought would be a completely authentic set of recordings  the complete absence of liner notes or production data also made me suspicious  there are lots of other trio matamoros discs that you might want to check out  first  and let me know which ones are good because this is the only one ive got so far|0
this cd has a handful of the most horrid attrocities ever attemped to be called music that i have ever had the unfortunate priveledge of listening to the first time i saw this movie i was very young and enjoyed the soundtrack i recieved the cd as a gift this is not the mission impossible soundtrack it is music from cough like 3 songs cough and music inspired by the film now incase you are wondering what kind of music this movie would be likely to inspire stop yourself right there and let me tell you the answer garbage there is music on this cd thats so mind curdlingly horrid that it makes you want to take two pencils stick them up your nose and slam your head down on the desk its that bad get the real soundtrack i hope you enjoyed my warning now i have to pull these pencils out of my brain cavity|0

yes there are already too many reviews and it hasnt even been 24hours since it was officially released however i am going to focus on the two lp set i did purchase the cd as well to burn to itunes but it turns out there is an undisclosed mp3 download form inside the lp oh well  i listened to the cd first why because i had to wash the records in my spinclean system to clean out stuff in the grooves and remove static unfortunately every new lp arrives with enough static to raise your arm hair and make all kinds of awful pops and ticks during playbackanyhow back to the sonics the cd is very clean and crisp or in other words the best modern digital is capable of i used my musical fidelity dac as an interface and the tubes in my gear warmed the tone nicely especially the acoustic guitars in the garden i was still washing other new records when the cd ended so i hit play again yes i too have heard the first two tracks many times since downlaoding them last year so when the cd hit the rocking seven cities of gold i stopped the playback to check out the vinylside three is where the aforementioned track begins and i listened to the three songs on this side with much appreciation for the wider threedimensional soundstage there is more separation in the instruments and sonic textures on vinyl i have a humble project debut iii with an ortofon 2m red cartridge on side four the last tracks seem to rise up from their grooves and shimmer in the air the last track on vinyl the garden was even more harmonically rich the acoustic guitar could have been a neighbor playing it was that vivid admittedly two hours of rush at high volume required a listening break but i will spin the first disc shortly i am sure the digital to analog debate will still rage but i feel the lps are wellworth purchasing i was lucky to get snakes and arrows before it went out of print and good luck finding it for under 125followup i finished the first disc and as i noted earlier the sound is tonally richer in analog and not because of my equipment either i have to say that the album does grow on the listener i think it is hard to make a complete assessment in one day i do stand by my opinion that the lps outshine the cd however if you have a turntable buy this set i noticed that the artwork in the cd booklet is a little better produced than the lp sleeves but that is trivial after i washed the discs i put them in mofi antistat sleeves because the stock paper ones can scuff the surface of the recordsallinall rush has presented us with some seriously heavy jams and an intricate story since most of the reviews are being made after 23 listens i think that time will be the best judge and even the harshest critic cant wait to see them live again i really like the production and the guitarwork is phenomenal|1
if the box did not say so i would never have believed that this was led by sir colin davis as a whole this set pales in comparison with the likes of guilini furtwangler krips even the new jacobs set surprising since i wouldnt hesitate to call davis the best mozart conductor of the fourthere are shining moments the ensembles are second to none and martina arroyos or sai chi lonore was a pleasant surprise unfortunately everyone else though great singers sounds like they are doing something they dont want to there is no emotion and the pacing is erratic mind numbingly fast here agonizingly slow there pitch perfect now and out of tune then did i mention i cant believe this is colin davis was that shoddy elvira the same dame kiri te kanawa i loved as the countess in figaro same could be said for wixell who had betterdays ditto frenieven the commendatore scene begins with a bang and ends with a fizzleon the whole a big disappointment and not something to waste money on in this economy|0

who is the idiot that put this in the flamenco calssification there is no music on this cd period there are several musicians who seem to be investing a lot of effort but dont seem to have any idea what the others in the group are playing a mishmash of disjointed noises that culd best be described as anitmusic|0
please people stop rating each track individually you cannot possible rate an album such as the wall in this wayand those who rate it as gloomy and depressing its supposed to be for s sake its about the decent into madness of a rock star whos off his trolley on puff neglecting his wife lost his dad mollycoddled by his mum and just generally hates the world yes its self indulgent but look through the indulgence and you will see theres a message here its message is similar in a way to supertramps hide in your shell in that its telling you to stop living in your own cocoon of fear and loathing and to wake up and realise that there are people who care for you and people with similar or even worse problems than youif anything i find this album uplifting just listen to the lyrics on outside the wallive listened intently to the wall for over 24 years the whole album is a master class in musical production including the clever subliminal things that you dont notice unless someone brings it to your attentionisnt this where|1

ok ok so the wall is geniousbutas far as aging well this cd comes in like 6th because at the time the things roger goes on about were very great to hear about and if you are old this cd probably makes alot more sence and youd like it morehowever big a genious he was this was a much different stroke for the pink floyd sound this is a wonderful cd but not in the same waywaters was once the leading force in pink floyd but i think somewhere between their 3 best  cds animalsdsotm and wywh david gilmour became alot better of a leaderwaters became to obsessed with his music he ruined it for everyonehe was one of the best producers bass players of all time until this point when he kicked out their useless keyboardist even though he made them who they were 14 and i mean seriously all the gilmour songs on here and basicly any song not fully made by roger are the standout songs he shunned their amazing drummer too i mean watch pompeiiso along with rogers worsening ability to make pleasing music to the average darkside listener the cd gives a really bad feeling of them breaking up and for all who will say this review sucks i dont know im just not with you guys i really liked daves touch alot more so thanks for the demise of the best pink floyd sound that there ever was and for treating geniouses who you grew up with like no ones you dooschandi was wrong this is much better than the final cut i really dont like any of that cd that much it starts off good soemtimes but rarely finishes off like a final cut not now john would be so cool without those stupid girl singersi wish it were dave in the backgroundso even though rogers new style was good enough to like the old was better and he was blind by his ego to see this i wonder if he has noticed yetso you get 4 starsbut just think if this cd didnt have comfortably numb or hey youagain why is this not in the movie and run like hell  daves or mostly daveswould you liek thsi cd so much  tell me what you think45|1
cab is great but not here minnie is eviscerated the rest are rather sluggishand spivak well i knew the name but had never heard him before and wont again this is generic mor dance music that would be perfectly at home as blahblah background in some mediocre 40s movie the guys can play but the whole sound is just kinda sleepy and dull no fire no zip and a bland vocalist combine for instantly forgettable materialsave your dough however little they want for something with the flash that made this an era of memorable tunes this is 32 minutes of decidedly secondrate stuff|0
while i love the music and the performer himself and im sure i would have been enthralled to listen inperson the quality of this digital recording itself is very poor songs start with and have a continuous hum of ambient noise the microphone seems overloaded frequently and the depth of the piano is totally missing listening to these songs i keep wanting to adjust my speakers or look for a bad connection there is no bad connection however  the songs are just badly recordedi suggest you move on|0
what a nice surprise this cd isif you like relaxed comfortable altcountry music that has deft touches of folk thrown in with excellent singing and harmonizing lots of good steel playing crisp drumming good keyboard work and good guitars  you will definitely enjoy high water line  the bouchards are not derivative of other bands at least not directly  they are students of music in general but the music they make is their own unique brandi find guitaristsinger bill preibs corrinne to be a standout track on the album  its a lovely ballad  preib contributes four tracks to this collection and guitaristsinger dennis tevlin contributes six including another standout the sinewy driving motherlodei smile and relax when i listen to these tunes  it is like rediscovering old friendstevlin provides a laughoutloud lyric in the delightful big man  i wont divulge it here you need to get a copy of the high water line cd and check it out for yourselfif you cant find the disc here at amazon google the bouchards for more information song samples and downloadsthis band is worth your while  relax and enjoy|1
i do not like this cd it has a very dark undertone to it creeps me out feels like itll give me nightmares the tropical sounds and birds are great but the instruments in the back were not chosen wisely to play|0
i cant give the item any stars because we never got it  the seller decided to not send it and refunded my money then they jacked up the price to twice what i originally paid for it  never once did i get a notice about this they even still said it had been shipped and every time i tried to track it i got an error message it wasnt until i decided to file a claim 3 days after it was overdue that i got the message banner saying that i could not file a claim because the purchase price had been refunded to me this seller is terrible i really would have liked to know sooner that i wasnt getting what i ordered instead of waiting around for it and never being notified|0
the one star review is unfortunately absolutely correct  i thought i was going crazy or that my ears were shot  after researching it i learned in fact that the speed was in fact too fast  so much for listening to or proofing their own product  one of my favorite procol albums i subsequently bought a japanese import of it|0
first listen second listen  tenth listen  each one brings something new something different  and the more listens the more you come to appreciate this jewelthe concept songs hold up well together as an ensemble but i never fully appreciated how well the songs hold up individually either until i took a break from this album and listened to some of my favorite rush albums from yesteryear  my previous gripes about how some songs werent melodic enough or werent individual enough melted away  truthfully the strength of this album as a whole rivals some of their best previous workthe variety is abundant  from emotional introspective tracks like the garden to slapitdownspititout stuff like bu2b this disc covers the spectrum  rush rocks hard  hard  with hints of unfaded glory from hemispheres vapor trails 2112 test for echo permanent waves and counterparts  dont get me wrong  this album does not sound like any of the others  but if youre familiar with their entire body of work youll see what i meancan you find a betterwritten song than the wreckers  i dare you to find another song that so elegantly blends music and lyric together and that so succinctly tells its story without too many words  pure perfectionnot since middletown dreams and the brilliant work of signals have i heard the longing and wistfulness of caravan  eyes on the skies and head in the cloudsheadlong flight  an instant rush classic and as heady and driven as anything theyve written  such a superb blend of rhythm and guitar such an adventure both musically and lyricallyi have never heard neil peart play so well  literally coaxing the exact perfect sound out of his percussion at every moment  subtle strong resisting the urge to overdo it when it doesnt fit then slamming it down with the precision that only he can muster when called for  what an artist  what does it mean to play drums  listen to thisalex  the unsung hero of this disc and the man who gets better with every album  hes amazing subtle full of texture licketysplitfast when needed and all things in between  look at what he does in the garden  holy moly  and then look at what he does in headlong flightgeddy  the core the glue the everything  his bass is as punchy as ever his singing is even better than on snakes and arrows and the song construction he put together for this disc is amazing in complexity and yet approachability  this man is a musical genius and songs like carnies and clockwork angels will make you swoonso why dock it a star  because i cant dock it a halfstar  this is really a 4 12 star album  the 12 star deduction is because i felt that despite the nearperfection i talked about above wish them well takes shortcuts and borrows too much from previous material  i love the message in that song and by no means is it horrible but it doesnt fit with the rest of the albumyeah  buy this album  now|1

this is a reissue of hayley mills firstand only album which was released in 1961  hayley mills was a popular teen star of disney movies at the time  if you were a teen idol during this time period you had to make records  unfortunately hayley mills could not singat all  she had a squeaky littlegirl voice and lack of an ear for either melody or rhythm  what you get on this album is musichall novelties like jeepers creepers and anemic rock n roll  chittering away above it all is hayley mills cute as a bug and just as annoying repeatedly displaying her one unique vocal trait the inability to hold a note for longer than one second  she gets around this by breaking up even the shortest words into two or three distinct syllables  for example shes just a guurl looking for a buhoy to luhuhuv  despite her utter lack of singing ability this album actually yielded a couple of hits  lets get together reached 8 on the hot 100 and johnny jingo got up to 21  you have to remember that this was the prebeatles era  i should also mention that this cd is only 23 and a half minutes long  but if you love to hear celebrities singing badly this album is a must get|0
okay we get it you dont like the album theres no need to post such endless amounts of incoherent babble attempting to state as much your words are to term a phrase you used to describe this amazing album the sickening results of egocentrism seriously if you really are a kid go out and play and stop spending so much time on the internet trying to annoy people go bug classmates at your nursery school or better yet grow up and get a life thank you|1
this is one of those bands that you find on the listening stand at an independent record store and buy it immeadiately after hearing it and listen to it for weeks on end  now that ive been listening to this cd for awhile now i cant figure out why they havent caught on  a lot of reviews say you cant compare this band to anyone elsebut you can  theyre a mixture of incubus and hoobastank musically and evanesense and avril lavigne vocally  its hard enough to still be independent but the sound is so crisp and polished that it should slide right into the mainstream on word of mouth alonethe lead singers vocals are outstanding  i read somewhere where they compared her to a blowtorchs intensity  its a cool glowing searing sound with sudden bursts of rage that captivate your ears the same way that a blowtorch catches your gaze  plusshes pretty hot herself  there arent many rock bands with female lead singers but considering this is just a debut album she could put those who are out there to shamefor as good as she is she doesnt over shadow her band like some other rock bands  the band is diverse in sound and rhythm  the ballads are as solid as the hard songs and theres a grit to their sound layered under the smooth stylized guitar riffsi like every song on this cd  im so sick is deffinately my favorite just because it incorporates some different sounds not found on the other tracks  but all the songs are unique in their own way  i have to admit i wish she let loose and screamed more on a few tracks but for what the cd lacks in screaming it makes up for in harmonies and echo effects  which both sound amazing on there for you in particularif you like intense rock with a smooth sound of any kind id check this cd out  it may not be innovative or indie but this is a great band with a sound thats addicting to listen to|1
first of all i must disagree with those who complain about geddys vocals on this album  as rush fans we all have to come to grips with elements of their music which we may find less than appealing  this said no one who knows anything about music can ever deny the talent and complexity that rush brings to all of their worknow the garden has to be the most improved  developed of geddys vocals of any rush song  he has gone so far beyond the hamster in the wood chipper and has produced something truly beautiful  i love this song for the clean crisp guitar and the melodic vocals all of it actuallyevery song has its share of rocket sauce black 2010  whether you like the song as a whole or not its hard for me to believe that there is no part of any song where even the most staunch critic can say wow thats coolthe jams are amazing  they really nailed this one  i cant stop listening  yes i am a rush fan but this is the first album ive been really excited about in a looooong time  vapor trails gave me a bit of hope snakes furthered that hope but clockwork brought it all home  soooo good  truly beyond wordsthe truth is all music grows on you  i love all of rushs work therefore its hard to point to a favourite  its all goodthank you to dirk lerxst  pratt for so many years of philosophy beauty depth and phenomenal musicheres to many more o|1
this album typifies arthur lyman and gives evidence as to why he was so popular in the 50s and 60s his music a blend of jazz hawaiian music and exotica is still treasured by those of us who are addictd to the melding of jungle sounds bird calls and hawaiian music  the next time you host a bbq light your tiki torches put on arthur lyman and turn your bbq into a luau|1

i somewhat agree with the first reviewer that everything lara did is unforgettable he was indeed one of the greatest mexican composers of the twentieth century but heres a warning the product description says that this is an agustin lara recording it is not it is a recording of lara compositions by a couple of pendejos calling themselves los pianos barrocoswhile the music here covers some lara compositions written about spain hence the title suite espanola these guys have none of laras soul and emotion in addition the cd is less than a halfhour long and contains no liner notes to enlighten the listener as to who these cabrones are so i really got the chorizo on this onesome of the music is not bad these guys are good pianists but its just not lara i see i bought the last copy available so the jokes on me if this becomes available again avoid getting the chorizo yourself by ensuring that the lara that you order will be lara indeed im almost tempted to return this but its a hassle so i will shelve it with great trepidation for a future generation to either enjoy or to use as a frisbee|0

i do believe that if francis wolff and alfred lion were around in 1972 this set would never have seen the light of day its an unmitigated disaster on several levels first off its bad enough to have one coltrane clone in your group yet this combo has not one but two coltrane clonesdavid liebman and steven grossmanwith little or nothing original to offer their directionless playing just goes on and on as the solos seem endless and dont go anywhere in particular just play a lot of notes scales and arpeggios as rapidly as possible without any sense of form or possibility of building to anything approaching a climax at the end of your interminable lengthy solos it doesnt matter whos playing both of these guys sound exactly alike theyre clones dont forget im not saying that theyre not talented saxophonists or dont have chops what i am saying is this why not just listen to a coltrane album instead of coltrane imitatorsnext problem gene perla this bassist gets the crude thin nonresonant electrified sound which for some reason suddenly became very popular with recording engineers and jazz record producers in the earlytomid 70s and the jazz public didnt seem to mind the lack of richness of resonance of that deep woody sound that was prominent in the 50s and early 60s what the heck happened to the booming almost tubular leatherlunged bass sound once the 70s kicked in dexter gordons homecoming lp for example is another set in which the bassist sounds like hes playing the bass strings of an emenee plastic acoustic guitar in the next building while the instrument is submerged in a tub full of quicksand im not saying that perla cant playhe obviously can although hes a bit too influence by scott lafaro for my tastebut that amplified tinny small sound of hisjesus the guy sound like hes being electrocuted every time he plays you know some people put down west coast jazz but listen to the way the rhythm sections were recorded on albums released by contemporary and mode in the 50s for example now thats how you record a bass contemporarys roy dunann in particular somehow made the bassist sound like he was standing right next to you in your living room and he did this on practically every album he engineered check out sonny rollinss way out west and lennie niehaus volume 5the sextet for prime examples of crispness and clarity in recording the jazz bass and indeed the entire group this engineering expertise became a lost art by the mid70s unfortunatelyand this is the main problem with the sound of elvin joness drums here they are not very well recorded youd figure that with elvin as the leader extra care would have been taken to ensure a good drum sound but the drums here sound like they were recorded up the street down the block round the corner and in the hallway as they lack clarity presence and definition the listener has to struggle to pick out the drums underneath the morass of endless mindless coltrane licks and electrified galvanized bass charles mingus once said something to the general effect that once a bass is amplified it totally kills the sound this album is testimony to that statement also i consider elvin jones to be for lack of a better term the ginger baker of jazza decent drummer immensely overrated by the critics he was put on a pedestal by jazz critics due to his membership in coltranes classic quartet i listen his drumming here and on other lps and im sorry i just dont get it jones was winning jazz polls and was universally considered a virtuoso but i fail to see why he doesnt seem to be in the same league as blakey roach kenny clarke philly joe etc everybody seems to think he was the greatest thing since the introduction of the green granules in oxydol so maybe its just me but stilloh yeah before i forget at the beginning of this disc theres not one but two boring introductions as if one wouldnt be sufficient like the music they go on too long yawnlook gang upon reading all the 5star reviews for this thing i decided to give it another chance or a plethora of chances under varied circumstances i listened to this album sober i listened to it stoned i listened to it after downing a few mickeys big mouths with cheez waffies for the chaser i listened to it standing on my head good thing i decided to do this before downing the mickeys big mouths i even listened to it while watching a dvd of pat boones all hands on deck with the sound off none of this did any good live at the lighthouse still sucks|0
so much good was said of this new remastering of the beatles sound that i enthusiastically bought this record only to discover it was much noise for less than little the sound is firmer which is nice but there is so much space between each instrument that you can proudly show of your loud speakers but the coherence of the sound has disappeared the texture is as metallic as techno music can be but the charm of the beatles sound has completely disappeared no humour no warmth no pleasure no charm in other words the final result is even worst than the previous cd version it is as if the engineers wanted to prove the beatles are a pale copy of michael jacksons music if you still have the lps hang on to them|0

i thought i would really enjoy the fruits of a collaboration of two of my favorite jazz artists  but the music turns out to be so frenetic and fast that it is bothersome  this might be the ticket for jazz fans that like that style and surely with these two artists the horn work is superbly done so could be appreciated by discerning jazz aficionados  i like the more deliberate and carefully worked pieces of which there are many of these two jazz greats but this cd does not go in the right direction for me|0
1 in the flesh great way to begin an album  its loud unexpected and sets the tone for the rest of the story2 the thin ice has a very doowop feel to italmost  leads to things to come3 another brick in the wall part i the first time what i consider to be the theme is stated  very similar lyrics to the thin ice4 the happiest days of our lives my personal favorite song from the wall  i like the way how it sounds like one long runon sentence  the transition to another brick in the wall part ii has got to be one of the greatest things of all time5 another brick in the wall part ii everybody knows this song6 mother fun to sing with  guitar solo reminds me of a ford commercial7 goodbye blue sky if anyone has seen the movie this seen is the best  sorry to say its not as impressive on the album but still good song  the synth at the beginning sends chills down my spine8 empty spaces great transitional song9 young lust it took me a little while to like this one but it eventually grew on me  its one of the few floydian rock n roll songs  now its one of my favorites though1012 one of my turnsdont leave me nowanother brick in the wall part iii i group these three all together because to me theyre all the same thing  not that impressive  i usually tend to skip these when listeninggoodbye cruel world14 hey you this song gets way too much radio play  i also dont think its the best way to begin the second half of the story but who am i to say15 is there anybody out there very mysterious and cool  the instrumentation at the end is really good  great atmosphere  in my opinion i think this should have started out the second half  the words is there anybody out there sets the mood for all to come16 nobody home i never use the word beautiful to describe a song but that is what this song is17 vera pointless18 bring the boys back home this song is also pointless but it is so cool  its definitely one of my favorites on the album19 comfortably numb everybody knows this one20 the show must go on brings the audience back to the beginning with similar melodies21 in the flesh brings the audience even more to the beginningduh  it has the same name and almost the same lyrics  i like it better though  the main character pink becomes a fascist dictator here  weird22 run like hell if you think this is good you should hear the version from the wall live is there anybody out there23 waiting for the worms more dictator stuff24 stop waiting for the worms crescendos up and up and out of nowhere pink yells stop  a new song begins and it is a great effect  and now the grand finale25 the trial don not be fooled you are listening to rock music still but you cant tell  all of the previous charaters the teacher the mother the girlfriendwife figure come back for the final trial  the entire thing is orchestrated until the end when the theme is stated in the electric guitar  brilliant  absolutely brillant26 outside the wall the wall crumbles down and this business happens  the melody from the very beginning is stated again and a loop is created|1
there are a select few comedians who are straight up funny some cough dane cook cough use profanity to cover up the fact that their routines arent really that funny not so with brian regan he is a tremendously smart guy who plays a stupid guy in his comedysince he has so much physical comedy though his facial expressions alone can make you burst out laughing i was worried that it wouldnt translate well to just audio i was wrong from stupid in school to fishing shows this is brian at his best two thumbs way up|1
way back when the movie was a hit warner brothers intended to release a soundtrack that included dialogue from the film  it has been reported by william friedkin that mercedes mccambridge refused to grant her permission and that project never made it to light  this record which has been around since the seventies contains maybe only two pieces that made it into the film  the rest of the music is new classical dense discordant intense and mostly unpleasant  some will appreciate the talent involved but it is not the sort of music most people would want to listen to while reading or dusting the house  whether or not it might have worked in the film is beside the point  it wasnt and so calling this recording a motion picture soundtrack is misleading|0
fee in the original played painfully brilliant by jean simmons was not religious in the missing years disaster most of her lines are about god did that bother anyone elsealso im sure they went through hundreds of boys to portray young dane a red head he looked nothing like the dane in the original luke at least tried to express himself as bryan brown did but meggie she just did her own thingrachel ward  has a very distinctive voice its called acting if you cant portray someone who was so vividly remembered then you didnt succeed in making the audience feel they were really watching the missing years|0
when i saw rush on the time machine tour they played caravan and bu2b live and it was really cool so i knew there would be at least a couple of good songs on this new disc this thing is awesome from beginning to end of note is theeverything including the kitchen sink caravan the hard driving seven cities of gold the song that i can only describe as by torthe snow dog 2012 headlong flight the really fun and rockin wish them well and the beautiful moving and profound the garden i cant seem to get enough of wish them well and the garden ive been a huge rush fan since 2112 and pretty much love everything they have ever done i can honestly say that this is one of my favorite rush albumsto geddy alex and neil thanks guys|1
slash fans listen up as soon as this record was availible i down loaded it from amazon mp3 this record kicks butt if anyone gives it less then 5 stares needs to listen to it more perhaps with head phones on and thier air guitar in hands i have played it at least 10 times in a row and it sounds better each time it is bound to be a rock classic some one tell me i am wrong|1

when bands exist for 30 years and have 20 albums to show for it there are bound to be peaks and valleys  this album is more like a craterone has to take into account the musical climate in the late 80s  metal bands were deeply divided  on one side were the poisonbon jovi cheesemetal bands on the other were the slayermetallica speedthrash metal bands  sabbath certainly didnt fit into either of these categories  it sounds like they were trying to appease popmetal fans  which didnt work  and succeeded in further alienating their gloom n doom fanbasealso it must be considered that by this time only one original member of black sabbath tony iommi guitar remained  joining him are exdeep purple drummer cozy powell whitesnake bassist neil murray keyboardist geoff nicholls andtony martingive the guy a break  he had pretty big shoes to fill and didnt quite take to sabbath as quickly as dio who gelled with the band immediately did  his operatic vocal style and boo scared ya lyrics at times border on parody  for example black moon gets off to a pretty good start but the groans begin with the first line oh the devil  its a very hamfisted lyrical approach and his attempt to create demonic imagery doesnt workthe mix doesnt help their case much  this is definitely sabbaths most keyboardheavy album  in fact the title tracks verse is driven almost entirely by keyboards and not the deep who are you type like on volume 4  the keyboards are airy for the most part and while some cool noises are made gates of hell the beginning of when death calls the bridge of call of the wild it succeeds mainly in neutering the guitar  iommis riffs are still there but theyre not quite as interesting as on previous albums  his solos are good as always and he even ventures into twohanded tapping during devil and daughter  cozy powells drumplaying is actually the highlight of the album except for the fact that theyre recorded poorly and have way too much reverb on them which takes away much of their punch  neil murray doesnt do anything all that interesting on bass for this oneheadless cross isnt without some highlights  theres a neat little easternsounding riff in kill in the spirit world but then the keyboards come in and kill it  the beginning of when death calls harkens back to the song born again in tone before shifting uptempo to mediocremetalville  cloak and dagger has a bit of poledancing sleaze before being ruined like most of the songs by an epic overblown chorus  the bad outweighs the goodbrian may appears on the song nightwing which has some pretty nice spanish sounding classical guitar work  other than that when an albums brevity about 45 minutes long is one of its highlights that generally means you should steer clear|0
this is trash you shouldnt blame it on spector its the beatles fault let it be is very overated the instrumentation is over worked and the lyrical concept is idiotic give up on problems dig it is idiotic 909 is idiotic maggie mae is trash and get backjuju the monkey is a little dumb in dig a pony john tells us that you can syndicate any boat you row and then repeats it as if its some great piece of wisdom there are two pieces of the song and they dont link up at all in across the universe john moans untranslated indian words this is just bad|0
these two cds are the best investment i have ever made i mean really you have to give some kudos to a chick that can scream like thatfk yeahseriously|1
my god this is even worse than the forty licks or zoso of the rolling stones and led zeppelin the beatles are one of the most overrated stupid lame and lousiest bands of all timelove me do has to be one of the lousiest songs i have ever heardanyone who listens to the beatles may have no taste in music even metallica is better than these loosers get them and avoid all albums from the beatles they are just as bad as other lousy bands like led zeppelin rolling stones who boston lynyrd skynyrd black sabbath pink floyd queen steve miller and acdc get any album from great bands like dire straits metallica nirvana guns n roses green day and foreigner insted|0
unlike bachs french or english suites which have gained popularity  amongst pianists within the last several years handels nineteen extant  suites for the keyboard have for the most part been neglected for  certain there hasnt been a plethora of handel keyboard works rendered on  pianocd or vinyl periodthe first complete cycle i  owned came some twenty plus years ago in a boxed emi lp import set performed by our friends richter and gavrilov from a  live concert the present cd twofer originates from these tapes for a  person who had not heard more than one or two handel suites in his life  listening to them all was certainly thrillingunfortunately these recordings havent worn well either on vinyl or their cd incarnations both sound and performance grow tedious and monotonous all too quickly a  distinct problem that may develop when baroque keyboard music is performed in a gruff cursory manner richter and gavrilov surely provide many  felicitous moments primarily during slow movements but more often than  not livelier ones are hammered out at annoyingly breakneck tempos this manic handling gets old quicklyrunning time cd 1 5928  cd 2 5953|0
this sequel or inbetweener whichever you want to call it is a terrible disappointment simply because it doesnt add up to the original miniseries serious deviation from the original storyline made it what it really was   a miss never mind that fr ralph decided to show up and came to know justine and dane in their early childhoodnever mind that fee was so full of life and appears to be at peace with meggie all throughout never mind that meggie made ammends with justine enough to send her to a prestigious school to hone her dramatic skillsnever mind that dane made his intentions of becoming a priest known in his early childhoodnever mind that luke came back to claim his son even though he never saw meggie again and could have realized that dane was never hisall of which of course could never have happened because there was a 19 year silence between fr ralph and meggie to even suggest anything like these would happen in between is absolutely out of linehowever the most glaring deviation of all is what irritates me the most  the reconciliation of meggie and luke it is an absolute defiance to the most touching scene to the original miniseries during danes funeral when meggie said to fr ralph the words you couldnt love me enough to know that i would never go back to luke or any other man after you meggie loved fr ralph so much that she even cursed god himself for taking him away from her after mattlock island where meggie experienced the culmination of her lifelong desire for fr ralph and eventually bore her a child its totally absurd to even imagine her going back to luke the centerpiece of the entire novel is the love story of fr ralph and meggie to alter this in any way is unforgivablerichard chamberlain was brilliant as usual but amanda donahue as meggie is not thorn birds rachel ward as one reviewer pointed out was what colleen mccullough intended her to be its never the same without rachel ward period even the chemistry between richard chamberlain and amanda donahue pales in comparison to that of richard and rachel there was no fire no passion  rachel as meggie is more believable than amanda the way rachel delivers her lines gives me goose bumps and her facial expression is perfect for the role  not too strong submissiveunassumingthe missing years would make for a good soap opera but not a sequel or inbetweener to what i consider as one of the best if not the best love story of all time|0
a great rock albumthe girl has got a great voice and thay rock|1
give me a breakthis is synthesizer filler with one finger wonder effects on a keyboardelevator for sure|0
i am a fairly new rush fan of a couple of years and i have nothing but praise for the concept album clockwork angels  it hearkens back to their famous themed album 2112 and some would say hemispheres as well  a steampunk influenced story that bears listening to over and over  others have described the songs in great detail but i will say it is hard to passively listen to this album it makes you want to move play the air drums and flat out rockshould be album of the year hands down and they deserve to be in the hall of fame after this or there is no justicei cant stop thinking big  that sums up this album big bold and beautiful|1
the lyrics help to capture the joy of the season without necessarily totally losing that traditional sound which those of us who love old school christmas carols grew up within summarymichael w smiths voice and the choir he uses blend well together to create a most amazing sound that captures the story of christmasaf|1
i dislike oh happy day is because it sound like it have no kind of base on it it sound as if it were a tin can and the back ground were drowing out edwin hawkinit had one song that were ok but not good at alli wouldnet recommend for any one to get this one|0
i came across this cd many years ago and have returned to it again and again  it moves me in ways which i find hard to describe  the title is an accurate description of the effect of the music everytime i listen to it i find my spirit literally soars i use this cd to relieve feelings of saddness andor grief and i trully believe it would aid anyone suffering from a significant loss  as a reflexologist and counsellor i use this music with my clients  i think clifford white must have been communing with the gods when he produced this album|1
i was very disappointed after listening to the samples of this cd  i was looking for instrumental christmas music the samples with singing just isnt what i was looking for|0
the music on the cd sounded like it was rerecorded on too high of a speed i dont know if the seller knew this|0
everybody was saying that it was a great band and great albumi think they are pretty bad musiciensthe guitar sucksdidnt enjoy it at all|0
i fully agree with the two other reviewers do not buy this recording you will regret it i had to beg the classical music store where i bought it to take it back it was such a shamefully poor recording i couldnt stand it and i love handel the sound of people coughing and clearing their throats in the audience is very annoying the recording quality is abysmal you cant get past the recording to enjoy the music buyer beware|0
i really like erics more recent work but if you do too beware this cd his playing sounds like that of a young guy starting out and trying to prove how good he is it shows great ability but lacks confidenceand his producers werent doing him any favours  the high echo level just exaggerates his saxophones shrillness when hes trying too hard|0
this book is a winner a document that shows the music industry for what it really is it also shows how people manipulate media on all sides for their benefit or cause its detailed extensive and sometimes funny this book goes beyond a simple documentation of who sued who and why its main message is to keep fighting for your integrity and ideas in the face of adversity with a sense of humor this book should be used in copyright law courses and is an important part of us law rock and roll and punk rock historyoh and the single the band got sued over is very funny too maybe u2 and negativland should start a joint charity called the snuggles foundation with the proceeds going toward copyright law reform just sayin|1
like most of garth brooks cds this one is average  the best songs on here are the dance and if tomorrow never comes  recording techniques using ultra modern equipment make anyone sound good but if you have ever seen this man perform liveand i havehe tends to go flat very often and cannot maintain his pitch  they can make anyone sound good on the records but the real proof of a good singer is in hearing them live  in garths case he does a lot of screaming and banging and breaking guitars but the man really cannot carry a tune to save his life|0
having heard good things about this interpretation and normally liking ormandy a lot i was terribly disappointed in his 1964 petrushka the music very seldom dances the whole affair seems leaden and if youre up for that sort of petrushka youd be better off with klemperers weighty but interesting account on testament bloated is what id say about this one  the philadelphia virtuosos cant rescue it from ormandy one feels ormandy probably only liked the firebird of stravinskys compositions the ugly spotmiking of the columbia engineers doesnt help its terribly obtrusive good luck too with szells firebird and daphnis i thought they were heartless|0
what a mind trip ive been listening to this since i was a kid everybody should check it out|1
brian regan is a hilarious comedian his ability to bring his jokes in a circle add a level of intelligence and humor not many comedians can achieve  i would highly recommend all of his work also very safe for kids|1
as a longtime zody fan i had high hopes for this record  from the interesting title cover and liner lyrics it had the makings for a great blast of rock music  but perhaps zodiac was in the midst of a dark drug binge when he made this disappointing disc  bad timing for fans that waited and waited for a fine followup to messiah  alas zody finally delivered with his latest effort i am rock buy it now  this one is very dark nearly suicidal and the cheesy slant he threw on things before is gone  perhaps that was by design  but this one gets few listens although as a collector i own it i think maybe he was lashing out at critics of the first album here trying to prove he really is psychotic  but all he did was confuse and lose fans  luckily zody found himself again and you would do well to welcome him back with the new release  it is what one more knife should have beenpete|0
this is an amazing cd it has the music video version of fully alive the acoustic tracks are also freakin amazing because of the rewriten cassie which is better then the original buy it youll love it|1
now that we are well past all the hype of the initial movie release even the pythons themselves are prepared to admit that the meaning of life was not their greatest work there is plenty of gore and a little sex to at least embarrass if not offend many this is not the sort of cd you can comfortably listen to with your parents or children in fact there isnt a single funny sketch on this cd that doesnt have some squirm valuebut there was plenty of gore and sex in previous python volumes so the question remains why does it not work so well here i think part of the reason is that there is an underlying meanmindedness here it happens to many of us as we grow older and our talent dims one tends to resent the fact that the youthful enthusiasm has gone and ones best work is perhaps in the past there is real hate in many of john cleeses deliveries here  eg in live organ transplants and the hospital birth sketch which is rescued by the machine that goes ping the pythons might argue that there was real political comment in those sketches but the public find it hard to accept such comment from those who clearly have a lot of moneythe other part of the reason lies in the money this was the first film where the pythons didnt have to be careful with money they didnt have to chase playboys victor lowndes who funded and now  or george harrison who funded brian no for the meaning of life the pythons had full hollywood backing and most of the money seems to have gone into the production values rather than the sketchwriting mike palin has spoken of his satisfaction with the choreography of the every sperm is sacred song but the problem is that python audiences come for the jokes not the dancing and all the humour in that sketch comes at the startthe trouble with being in the position of having made it is that you have less to prove when the pythons really had to struggle to get the finance together they knew they had to create something outstanding to justify their backers support when the finance is secure when you know that the film wont change your life much and when your main problems are hollywood producers grumbling about schedules and budgetsyour output is going to look much more like productionline outputmike palin once said that of all the sketches hed written his favourite was the communist quiz its also one of the pythons most familyfriendly sketches if theres any humour left in the python team this is the sort of material they should be creating|0
no one needs a review of this at this point in life but to me this was always floyds best album  everyone can argue darkside and wish or their earlier stuff and thats fine by me  i personally have always thought this is one of the top 10 albums ever  for me at least  i wish theyd release it in sacd or dvdaudio  i have about 4 versions of it asian remastered etc|1
those weened on the mantovani sound will be gravely disappointed with the arrangements on this cd the overlapping lush string sound of the maestros arrangements is missing from roland shaws proclivities toward woodwinds and brass this music can only appeal to those who actually like elevator music with little creativity and novelty  ironically many associated mantovanis music in the late sixties with the elevator sound  this cd only lends credibility to those critics before his death mantovani knew that only certain songs were suitable for his string orchestra  he generally stuck to popular classics not just popular as these selections are  for uplifting music that is strictly mantovani look elsewhere for this music only takes mantovanis name on a ride down|0
this cd offers excellent dub tracks to many of cultures biggest hits both from the classic trio lineup as well as some of the more modern ones as welldub fans and fans of culture will both embrace what culture has to offer and run with it a nice album and lovingly done as well yummy|1

this is truly a funny entertainer  who can skillfully be funny without the use of vulgarity this is a great cd to help with a long otherwise boring drive|1
finally after listening to several other hanukkah albums i found this gem the music isnt at all annoying and like another reviewer stated it promotes family togetherness a few of the songs are soothing like a hap palmer album all in all the best album i have heard so far|1
this album in my mind is top 5 best in their discography the sound is amazing vocals are a strong as ever and each player are at the pinnacle of their craft its disappointing to hear so many complain about some songs being too complex or having too many changes and sounds going on at once last i checked rush is still a progressive rock band the whole point of being labeled progressive means they are not taking the road most traveled and are creating material unique to themselves and the genre 2112 anyone hemispheres if you want simple time signatures and radio friendly melodies there is ton of beautiful melody on this album by the way go listen to alternativepop nonpioneers like nickelback their is a lot of creativity and effort in this album and it deserves more than one listen the liner notes also illustrate an pretty intriguing conceptstory as well and really add to the overall experiencemoving on a great album by a great group of guys i have to say im enjoying this album a lot more than snakes and arrows and really feel that if this were their last album lets hope its not that it would be a great final chapter to their 38 years together just listen to the last track the garden and itll leave you feeling more than satisfied|1
i like a variety of music and was looking for one of his cds i did not really like this one becasue it only had two songs i liked the rest i did not care too much fori probably should have listened to the entire cd i would have been able to jusge whether i liked it or not at that point i would have know i did not like it|0
wow what a great combination they should get together on a permanant basis hope there is more to come rnfr|1
this cd is a great tool it has helped remind me of the information i learned in the meditation classes at cdm spiritual teaching center and operating as spirit with a body on planet earth daily meditations help me stay focused on what is important on my spiritual path and to let go of the stresses and strains of day to day life|1
been looking for this cd for a while  description said it was used but i couldnt tell it was it looked new and played great|1
for the true dedicated beatles fan this has to be a treasure  their very first cd released on january 1 1900 or so amazon says  though i have not yet heard this i would expect some more casual fans to be disappointed in the sound quality of this very early compact disc release after all most groups were still using compact cylinders back then  but dont let the primitive recording technology fool youthis is some of their best stuff because every real fan knows the beatles were all downhill after 1907|0
this has got to be rushs best work falling 2nd would be either snakes and arrows or test for echo the pure heaviness and intensity of caravan and bu2b is a great open to the album and a great announcement that the boys are back but at the end of the day i have to give it up for 3 songs the wreckers the garden and halo effect these songs will bring any rush fan to their knees i almost cried listening to the garden and halo effect and the wreckers is probably the best song on this record maybe even their best everhighly recommend this album for any rush fanlong live rush|1
music for trance is one of the most serene and calming pieces of music i have ever heard no beat no melody the sparse minimalistic compositional approach taken makes this very relaxing background music for meditation yoga or calming your nerves enjoy the peace and tranquility|1
ive been a huge slash fan for as long as i can remember hes the reason i started playing guitar got a les paul and joined a band appetite is one of my favorite rock albums of all time the use your illusions albums were not quite as straight out rock n roll thanks to axl and his penchant for overproduction and orchestral background music then slash ventured off into snakepit and velvet revolver which both put out some good albums but nothing like thisslash was and always will be a meat and potatoes rock n roller his debut solo album though very strong just wasnt very cohesive it was hard having so many singers and so many different types of songs on the same album through that process thankfully slash met myles kennedy and the rest is historythis album start to finish is pure rock and roll every song hits you hard with upbeat tempos biting guitar riffs and screaming slash solos he flat out sounds better on this album than he has since the gnr days his signature sound is there but with myles out in front the pair put together some outstanding rock music couple them with brent fitz on drums and todd kernz on bass his touring band the last few years and this is one cohesive hard rocking albumthe difference between this album and his last are night and day you can hear how tight this band is as theyve played so much together over the last few years the songs sound great but not overproduced like so many rock albums these days eg daughtry the drums sound like real drums and not coming from a computer the guitar riffs sound raw and the vocals are tight but not overdonei could go through what makes each song great here but youll hear for yourself i got this album the day it was released and havent stopped listening to it since then my favorite song is probably anastasia which starts off with some great acoustic work followed up by one of the best guitar riffs slash has written since sweet child o mine his solo work in that song is brilliant as is everything else hes done herethis is slash at his finest since his gnr days do not hesitate to buy this album|1

what i want when i buy a cd of whale song is simply that whale song  i dont want other music of which this does happen to be devoid but i also dont want surf sounds or other above water animals or other below water animals for that matter  i have tried many times to enjoy this disc but the surf sounds which begin even before the first hoot from a whale ruin it  i usually dont last more than a few seconds though i have forced myself to listen all the way through a few times  save yourself  look for a recording that has only whale sounds|0
this had to be the worse music i ever heard how can anyone record a cd like this it has to be a joke dont even think of buying this cd|0
the other three reviewers loved this recording but my own personal response was surprisingly negative for a great conductor like ormandy i just plain didnt like it and because of it  it was the only recording i had  i didnt really appreciate the symphony either i did learn to love this great symphony when i heard the eugen jochum 1964 recording with the the royal concertgebouw orchestraobviously this is not a music review from an informed critic but if there is someone out there whose response to the ormandy was as lukewarm as mine i cannot recommend the jochum more highly it is luminous and wonderful get it|0

i am a diehard julie andrews fan so that already  brings it down a notch i also really like audrey hepburn and the fact that she didnt do her own singing makes it seem fakei absoulutley hate marni nixions voice on this album her voice sounds flat and too american her cockney isnt the best  but ill lay off of that because it is hard to do a good cockney if your are americani love rex harrison on both albums he is so funny i would have loved to see julie andrews and rex together to witness the chemistry between them on the obc it would have been marvelous go buy the original broadway cast album|0
i was introduced to chickenfoot by my fiance some time ago and was instantly hooked  so for a surprise gift i bought him this cd and i must say as good as the last one was this one was even better  when you get joe sammy and the others collaborate together pure magic happens and this cd is evident of that|1
this is my sons favorite band always a perfect present for him at any holiday or birthday present  thank you|1
i was highly disappointed in this cd there was only one really good tune on this|0
this album far exceeded my expectations the energy and lyricism of the music is a throwback to their earlier days while the musicianship style and modernness continues to compound|1
yellow bird by the arthur lyman group is a sparkling diamond  it is intricate gentle wistful magical possibly the most beautiful instrumental ever to hit the charts  this magic couldnt be sustained by anyone  you cant produce the most beautiful recording of the year a dozen or more times on an album  the rest of the songs are pretty ok too|1
aztekas sueno americano on univision is a 1000 x better cd check it out and u wont regret it viva la raza|0
i know nothing about the track  visions of your reality  for one thing i was 2 years old when this album was made whats left is pretty impressive for the most part the opening cut behold and see features a hendrixian riff all the way through the second track is one of ultimate spinachs best the epic and atmospheric mind flowers  which is more doors like the band was very good at long pieces and the instrumentation was usually quite good  and this is droning downer of a cut is first rate  another stand out track is fragmentary march of green this number is rather jefferson airplane like it is somewhat comparable to the airplanes great house at pooneil corners  in that both tracks are excellent pieces with a feeling of doom the lyrics of both songs are socially conscious and deal with most of the big issues of the time in question jazz thing is another fine number this album  as a whole might not be quite as good as the debut but i think that the 2 best songs of the bandmind flowers and fragmentary march of green are contained on the disc|1

i am normally quite a fan of nimbus recordings and i own many good ones but this set is not one of them  the david hurwitz comment shown on the listing is absolutely accurate and it is a credit to his gentlemanly approach to all concerned that his observations are not more scathingin addition i would advise extreme caution in buying period instrument versions of anything if you have perfect pitch  the ear will not necessarily acclimatise to period pitch as you listenthe sum total of this set warrants a miserable single star but i give it two on the basis that i am sure everyone involved with this project began from a standpoint of good intentions we all know what the familiar english proverb says about that which is amply borne out here  by the time anyone reads this i shall no longer own these cds|0
i loved this music when it was first released on vinyl disc and tape almost 30 years ago today im buying it again on cd it sounds as brilliant and surreal as it did back then unfortunately i hardly see such talent in todays artistesneeds no further comments|1
the criticisms of chickenfoots selftitled debut including shallow halfbaked lyrics and a lack of depth cannot be said of chickenfoot iii better songwriting a good deal more depth both musically and sonically plenty of late1960searly1970s classic rock vibe and slicker production make for one hell of an album and this sophomore effort marks a definite and big step forwardthe highlights last temptation the opener is hard bluesy and chunky with a good dose of attitude and a guitar solo that comes out of nowhere satriani must have been thinking hendrix when he wrote the music for up next a dark thumping song with one hell of a guitar solo lighten up is even darker and might be seen as chickenfoot plus deep purple it has a killer hook and a killer vibe this is a big damn song with a lot going on big foot on the other hand is a straightup nobs driving tune with some funny lyrics dubai blues sweet groove with a sweet bluesy dirty hook and excellent backandforth between the vocals and satriani who provides a couple of solos that are among his best there are three songs that tilt toward the lighter side different devil come closer a great soulful track and something gone wrong show chickenfoots deeper side the album closes by kicking things back up with a hidden track called no change  push past the political lyrics and youll find a killer song with a killer vibe that showcases everyone in the band giving 110 and thats the essence of chickenfoot iii sammy hagar joe satriani mike anthony and chad smith all have had amazing careers full of amazing moments here the band sounds as tight as any other band in peak form chickenfoot iii will stand as one of the best things any of them has ever donei will say it again this is one hell of an album|1

theres no contest if youre trying to decide between this and the two philips 2fers the philips recordings are more flowing betterrecorded and contain more drama and attention to the long line and long argumentso important in sibelius  based not just on these but his other recordings recently colin davis seems to be softening in old age  leslier gerbers statement that these recordings are more aggressive baffles me  compare literally any section side by side and youll find the climaxes here more muted the tympani is particularly dull and thuddy the stringplaying less taut and the overall conception far less edgy  the sound is a little fuzzy too  when the complete set plus overtures tone poems and violin concerto can be had on philips for about thirty bucks theres no contest and no reason this cycle was even necessary|0
this free jazz session features cecil mcbee on bass norman connors on drums and sam rivers on piano sax flute and screams the screaming solos remind me of hermeto pascoal the flute solos remind me of ornette coleman and hermeto and the piano part reminds me of cecil taylor one of the most tense and abstract jams ive heard but i still prefer his contours album featuring herbie hancock freddie hubbard ron carter and joe chambers|0
the beatles are one of the most overrated bands of all time they are overrated lame stupid and lousy each and every song except birthday is bad especially the horrible while my guitargently weeps avoid all the beatles and get nirvana nevermind insted|0
in my opinion this is the deepest and most revolutionary album ever released the album doesnt have any real meaning until you discover the story behind it my favorites will be listed with reasoning1 mother its asking his mother if he should shelter himself from the world which seems to have turned against him at the time in his life but at the end he realizes that the wall his psychological block of the world was built too high which resulted in him turning to drugs and all the temptations of rock and roll stardom this is a brilliantly done song 1 on my list of this album2 i dont think i have much room left so ill stop on this in the flesh with a period it explains how horrible society was at the time of wwii it demonstrates how unethical and wrong hitler and the nazis were during the time and that he knew it i like this because it has such a deep meaning when you think about it well you just have to listen to understand this song should not be taken as a song supporting racism it is exactly the opposite actuallyi hope i helped in your decision to purchase this album|1
after seeing the movie which contained several excellent techno tracks i spent a good deal of time trying to track down this cd  i was pretty excited when i finally found ithowever this cd doesnt have any of the techno songs from the movie  the cd is actually what is traditionally known as a movie score  that is a collection of instrumental pieces that were written specifically to enhance the effect of certain scenes in the movie  not that the score was unbearably bad although i didnt care for it much  it was sort of new age classical  not my type of music but it just wasnt what i had expected  so my search for the song she makes me want to die the best techno track from the movie continues|0
sucks angelsreally blows and i am a rush fan from way back butt not no noreno nore of this high pitched whine from geddy lee he cant sing a noteanyways and the lyrics are pathetic nobody butt a rush fanbought this album anyways and for the cd it was a rip toorip rush|0
this is one of ghetto mafias best  it is a combination of blues and rap to give it a sound like no other  ghetto mafia has a style like no other group which keep them on top and unique|1
this review written by harold rome was a very disappointing recording  the satire of the songs did not have the punch they might have had  the music was forgettable and the performances were adequate|0
its hard to believe that the composer of these works was the same man who penned symphonies no 1  5 the latter of which certainly deserves to be considered amongst the greatest of 20th century symphonic works in contrast 2  3 are nearly worthless pieces of music they are similar to the samenumbered symphonies of dmscs contemporary khachaturian in an absence of melody lack of any intelligent thematic development and an ugliness of instrumentation perhaps no contemporary composer combined such heights of achievement ie symphony no 5 with such depths of banal ugly music unless you have to have everything that dmsc composed please avoid these works  which have conveniently been packaged together where they belong|0
the songs were fine however the album was just a compilation of music from his other albums which i already owned since i couldnt know the contents it tuned out to be a disappointment|0
we bought this music to go dr lam dvd the music is perfect and gives you the correct timing for doing the 24 form tai chi besides that it is very relaxing anf beautiful music|1
roger waters proves the world his lyrical genius through this album other rock stars write songs waters puts years and years of mental anguish into two cds of the most solid music ever created the soaring sonic and lyric  picture created by the magic combination roger waters haunting vocals  david gilmours amazingly influential guitar work nick masons steadfast  bass contribution and richard wrights percussive backup has made this  album and instant classic however in the midst of waters amazing lyrics  the musicality of this album must not be forgotten david gilmour plays  some of the most amazing solos ever recorded in comfortably  numb and the sonic picutre created in in the flesh  leaves a chill and a vivid mental picture in ones head for quite a while  all in all this record is a must have for anyone who appreciates music in  any context|1
a great pink floyd album with in my opinion their best song comfortably numbthey are probably the 2nd best band of all time behind the doorsso buy the wall and dont listen to retards like fed up|1
i bought this album because it won the 2012 western heritage wrangler award album of the year i wasnt dissapointed at all|1
junque music  sorry i bought it  there are two songs off of the raising arizona tracks that i do like however im really not happy with this one at all  maybe i can go up to a pawn shop and trade it for something listenable  sorry carter|0
i must disagree with most of the reviewers here i found this cd to be filled with lowgrade simple humour about little else than how fat this guy is  its really not that funny its pretty much a continuous sequence of oneliners and scenarios where the punchline of course is about how fat he is  maybe this is niche humour or something that overweight people would find funny but if you want comedy thats both funny and makes you think a little bit too try dennis miller woody allen george carlin steven wright robert klein or eddie izzard there are many others that i cannot think of|0
after producer mike spalla had success with twojingle catschristmas albums it was natural for him to release a third one  but he must have sensed that people might grow tired of jingle cats so for the third album he switched to jingle dogs  its the same concept except with dogs barking instead of cats meowing  it is billed as real doggies sing holiday classics but of course its fake  barking dogs were recorded on a sampler and then played back with a keyboard to bark christmas melodies  by the way the jingle cats appear on most of the songs  the songs include familiar christmas songs and notsofamiliar ones patapan  the last song here is an original silly song which includes actual words sung by the jingle elves sped up human voices  this album is somewhat amusing for a song or two but it gets tiresome after a while|0
i bought this album so i could listen to all of the new songs since i am going to their concert in november lots of great new songs|1
hey you if you have anything negative to say about the wall i suggest you run like hell in the other direction before i have one of my turns|1
if you have heard the lp records of the original cast this performance simply does not match up the music is powerful and the songs are especially evocative but the singers particularly the female singers  simply do not have the vocal intensity to match the music and the  instrumental accompaniment is limited as well all in all it is a pallid  evocation of the original|0
i enjoyed this album a lot i have always been a fan of joe satriani and with him chad smith and sammy hagar i thought how could i go wrong|1
this album grew on me  first time through i connected with maybe one or two songs but by the fourth time i finally arrived at a fuller appreciation of the others  there is so much here it takes time to comprehend it but pace yourself because you dont want to burn out these are extremely experienced rock musicians  id also recommend vapor trails test for echo and counter parts|1
if you wanna know viper stick to their second album theatre of fate this debut here lacks in production and is just a copy of every imaginable heavy metal cliche they could remember to use at the time|0
the 720 of headlong flight is worth the full retail price of the album  the instrumental break with its little vocal intro oh i wish that i could live it all again at 350 gives me chills every time|1
i have waiting for this cd to come out and the 5 years was worth the wait  this cd rocks i have been waiting for rush to go back to their harder music and this cd has done itgeddys voice is as good as everespecially on the track headlong flightwowhis range is still great  keep rocking guysyour a 5 star with me  aloha|1
we recommended this to our actors thinking they could use it as a guide to prepare in private before rehearsals startoopsthis particular show obviously interpreted the original script fairly loosely the arrangements of about a quarter of the songs are so different from the score that they proved unusable for these i either had to buy the original songs and edit them on a computer or played and recorded them on keyboard as per the scorealso some of the singing reinforces my opinion that most singers cant act and most actors cant sing unfortunately our singers have now absorbed the quirks and its proving difficult to unlearn thembut i can well imagine that if you were at this particular show this is a nice memento|0
sadly oh so sadly its all but over for rush the magic is gone and seems never to return when you turn sixty how much more time do you have to make yet another comeback the new album clockwork angles is rough and harsh dim and depressing the songs are atrocious the album has not one melody the lyrics are juvenile and absurd with no memorable or important meaning and it has no guitar work that you will be hearing and remembering for the rest of your life like so much of their earlier work even test for echo which i originally abhorred now sounds operatic compared to this hacking gasping sputtering chainsaw of an albumgeddys voice is gone neils drumming is slow and has lost all crispness watch him live now and his elbows are raised almost as high as his shoulders a sign hes old stiff and struggling just to keep up watch the old stuff elbows low to the sides strikes hard and sharp and precise but their sixty now and in all fairness what can we continue to expect only alex seems to have some of the old magic in the later part of the garden after the nongeddy piano solo to me this is the only part of the entire 67 minute album worth listening to about 45 seconds and thats itthe biggest disappointment with the album which really has more to do with the guys is the choice of producer nick something is a child among legends and this brings me to the point if geddy neil and alex have lost their way so bad lost belief in their own talent to the point where they turn themselves over to a very young very average producer then i suppose they get what they deserve a terrible album at a stage when they should have slowed down to reflect their aging arms fingers voices and hands and gone for melody simplicity and authenticity reflecting who they are in the later half of life to try and recapture youth by being pushed around by a youngster with 150 the talent understanding and experience of these giant musicians is insulting to us the fans rush you are trying way to hard to be hip and cool young and still relevantsadly you are none of these things now please go back to the drawing board start trusting in your own instincts your brilliance once again and find a new producer or preferable the old one terry brown we still want so desperately to believe your next album will be the best yet sadly clockwork angels isnt even close please try again|0
i was first introduced to pink floyd although i had heard some things about them every now and then when i heard about dark side of the moon synching up with the wizard of oz i was immediately interested so i  bought dark side of the moon and since i already had wizard of oz i tried  it out  however as soon as i started playing the cd i didnt even  care about the synchs the music blew me away and thats how i started to  like pink floydanyway i started learning more about pink floyd  im only a teenager how am i supposed to know a lot about pink floyd  including the wall after hearing a lot about it i rented the movie i  loved both the movie and the music accompanying it after that i bought  the albumlet me tell you this album is like no other like dsotm  it just blew me away from the opening chords of in the flesh  to the soft mellow tune of outside the wall i listened to  this album all the way through without even moving except to change cds  when the first disc was over my favorite songs on this album are  comfortably numb part 1 2 and 3 of another brick in the wall happiest  days of our lives i love the ending of that song and the trial of  course every song is goodif youre not a floyd fan yet buy  dsotm but after that go for the wall i guarantee youll like it|1
i have never written a review but you need to be warned  i wasted my money and it has nothing to do with the movie  there are no lyrics just music  i dont know why the actual soundtrack isnt available for purchase  i bought it for my husband and played it as a surprise but i was the one who was surprised i kept waiting for soundtrack based on the moviehe wanted to know what the f i had playing  if you are expecting the songs you heard while watching the movie you will be very disappointed  dont order this|0
i was really disappointed with this cd  i wasnt expecting much  environmental cds tend to be like wine the more you pay the better the quality  i purchased this to stock up on whale song samples long story dont ask but this one i played once and promptly put back into the cd shelf where its been gathering dustive only sold a used cd of mine 3 times many years ago but this one actually has me thinking about dropping by my local used cd store to pick up a buck or two in store credit|0
this came out the same year as roger waterss radio kaos and while this one sold like hotfire rogers album didnt do too well  kaos is definitely better than this one and this album as many have said before amounted to a david gilmour solo album  nick mason is featured as a group member but he didnt write any material and honestly i dont know how much of the drumming is really his  carmine appice one of rocks most underrated drummers and super sessionman jim keltner are featured on drums  richard wright was not an official member of the band he quitgot forced out by roger waters during the wall sessions only to come back for the subsequent tour but then was let go again  he was just a hired musician for this one  the album is not a complete disaster as there are a few decent songs on it just a few though  despite the fact that it sounds like 80s aor material i like learning to fly a bit  the song the dogs of war is really embarrassing as gilmour attempts badly to sing like roger waters and the lyrics come across as some college kid discovering that governments can be corrupt  waters wrote much more eloquently about war and well just about everything  on the turning away sounds like warmed over dire straits which can be ok but id rather really listen to the real thing but the best song on the album is the closer sorrow  it starts with a great killer riff and it has the best lyrics on the albumthe best thing about this album is the cover  i think its the best cover of all pink floyds albums  the title is great too  but its not really a pink floyd album  it doesnt feel like one at all and many have suggested that gilmour and mason threw this album together simply to go on tour which probably has some truth in it  still regardless of the debate is this a floyd album its still not very good|0
harnoncourt did a wonderful job with the orchestra especially the accompanied recitatives but forgot to tell his singers that they should sing rhythmically the voices are wonderful but never really together with the orchestra its very free and unaccurate generally the singing is very fine but has not so much to do with mozarts style there are better recordings|0
descriptionlike clockwork every 60 million years the earths magnetic poles reverse 65 million years ago the earths magnetic poles switched leading to the destruction of the dinosaurs planet earth is 5 million years late for the next reversal by the time the scientific community realizes whats to come it may already be too latea group of  four scientists and medical doctors begin noticing that there are things changing in their areas of study david a geologist realizes that the earth is due for a complete magnetic pole reversal like the event that took out the dinosaurs jillian and jordan work for the cdc and are studying a disease that seems harmless until its victims become comatose and begin to die and becky a biologist discovers sixlegged frog mutants and strange bird migration patterns none of these events seem to have anything in common until the four of them meet and discover that the pole reversal starting and maybe the end of existence as they know itreviewi am a fan of science fiction and endoftheworld theories therefore when i saw the giveaway for this book on librarything i knew i had to enter after the first two chapters i didnt want to put the ebook down what began as a slowpaced introduction to the characters and their strange discoveries turned into a fastpaced pageturner aj scudiere has a way with making the world and characters within this book come to life i felt like i was part of the action trying to figure out why everything was happening and how the pole reversal would effect me i love when a book makes me feel included in some way being a microbiologist i definitely appreciated the science behind the pole reversal and i think the author did a great job setting up the plot and the dialogue especially the scientific parts which were easier to understand than in other books of the genre overall i thought the book was great and it had everything i wanted in an endoftheworld scenario the only thing that bothered me was the snappiness of the ending which seemed a little rushed but all of the loose ends seemed to be tied up and accounted for i recommend this book to science fiction lovers and people who want to read about world ending scenarios that doesnt involve zombies aliens or mayan prophesiesrating on the run 45 i received this ebook from librarything member giveaways griffyn ink in exchange for an honest and unbiased review|1
i loved tinas new meditation cd survive cancer now this relaxing cd can be used for any disease you are wanting to release  each time i listen to tinas soothing voice during this meditation i am able to go deeper  thank you tina for sharing your gifts|1
this is floyds worst album  waters lyrics are great but the music instrumentation is lacking  anyone who thinks this is their best dont like music they only like lyrics  pass on this and just read a book  by the way rogerless floyd is better than this and its a good thing too because if they would have ended when this came out the would have went out with a stinker  any and every other floyd album is much much better musically this is lyrical masterpiece but a musical joke|0
ansermet left the swan lake an orginal and classic perform|0
just now catching up on a lot of the good musicgroups i didnt appreciate in my younger life pink floyd is definitely one ive been missing out on good music crisp clear sound only overshadowed slightly by dark side of the moon|1
its nice to have earlier material from band i only recently purchased this but i think they really hit their stride with hag seed|0
this is mwss first christmas album to clarify confusing comments on another review here  i have it on a cassette which by now has worn out so i purchased the mp3 album to replace it it has been a favorite of mine for at least twenty yearsi enjoy the album because smith is a talented arranger of traditional favorite christmas songs as well as a talented writer of his own original music songs such as all is well have become new classics now covered by others clay aiken for example lux venit an offering that features a boys choir and latin lyrics is another special favorite of mine i find this cd so uplifting and so capable of putting me in a worshipful frame of mind that i enjoy listening to it all year round|1
im sorry i know this is a classic disc and it is scowled upon to defile the sacred ground of classicness with a different view but this album just isnt that good this album sees roger waters getting more controlling and egotistical resulting in a big big flaw his voice roger waters cannot sing wywh and dsotm see gilmore or gilmore and a harmony track doing the lions share if not all of the vocal work waters voice is shrill often times waivers to sour notes and not totally under control by deciding to take the forefront with vocals and total songwriting on this disc he hurts the band by making the music take a back seat to his ego above and beyond vocals musically this album is mediocre at best it lacks the vision and sonic experimentally of wywh and dsotm the album takes far to few chances and is lacking in the pfhallmark harmonies of the aforementioned discs this album all in all ends up being a mediocre classic rock disk with little innovation and nothing ground breaking if you think eric clapton rocks then this disc may be for you but if the same brand that brought you welcome to the machine wafting into quasiblues70sstandardrock sounds a tad bit unapealling go grab something else instead|0
as a fan of 34 years i have always enjoyed every new rush release but have not felt the releases of the past 2530 years have been at the level of their peak period 2112 through moving pictures  with that said i have always felt that eventually rush could make another utterly defining yet forward looking and starkly amazing album as their best work for that 25 years or more i imagined what it might be like many times it might hint at specifics of their greatest works but never sink to aping them  and this would only be because they would finally stop running from their past successes and embrace who they are  they would just be rush so at the same time a single glance backwards would allow several steps forward i also have always preferred neil pearts lyrics when he weaves them through a more literary setting  when telling a tale as opposed to making direct commentary on verious states of human affairs when it is underpinned within a tale it just feels so much more interesting and they would open it up and really cut loose with the playing stretch the songs a bit not wanking just to show off but rather playing aggressively more frequently to elevate the song even morewell guess what clockwork angels is that album it fills in all the pieces of the puzzle that shaped what i could only vaguely imagine but always felt like it could happenthere are always great driving songs on a rush album whether its far cry one little victory or driven on clockwork angels there are so many  caravan headlong flight bu2b the anarchist seven cities of gold carnies there are no weak songs here and the individual songs are never weighed down by the concept strip any one song and it stands on its own like the songwriting of the keyboardera in the late 80s  the wreckers you want a huge proggy concept piece  the title track clockwork angels you want a down and dirty gutwrenching track  carnies an utterly beautiful and poignant song  the garden celebratory  wish them well musically and sonically aggressive almost the whole album but especially headlong flight and caravancollectively and individually even more than they always do rush have hit a high point all at once geddy lee has one of his best vocal performances  hes not shrieking but hes certainly moved into the higher range of his vocals quite a bit more often than on many recent releases this time hes sitting in a sweet spot that is less likely to sound shrill to the more casual less appreciative listener but still a welcome relief to old school fans who yearn for the classic syrinx likewise alex lifeson turns in plenty of soloing carefully measured not to run on for too long yet still completely in the moment highlights the aggression in the headlong flight solo and the split second at the end that evokes only an ever so brief hint of working man in the final split second the beautiful lyricism of both the clockwork angels solo and the solo from the garden there are many more excellent solo moments as well my pick for top solo clockwork angels it is genius and of course neil pearts drumming the everrehearsed drum master always up for a new challenge took a new approach that allowed him to play more freely and create his parts very much in the moment for this album it affects the albums feel in a fantastic and amazing way and the playing is as dexterous and complex as any of his storied career it is both cohesive and urgent as a bass player this is easily one of geddy lees most impressive and aggressive works  his lines weave in and out of the song melodically in all of their fleetfingered glory through the most aggressive of tones both huge and grinding and totally inyourface lifesons rhythm guitar work is far less layered and far more direct and focused on the main part at hand  which really highlights his inummerable strengths as one of the most brilliant and completely underrated guitarists of our time and there are more riffs enough said on that matter neils lyrics are brilliant  it brings together the literary the topical tells a story and each chapter stands on its ownthis album is everything rush  everything they ever were everything they are and everything they ever will be every man stands out and they all stand out how they are able to sound collectively brilliant and individually brilliant at the same time is something they are so amazingly good at it it boggles the mind yet its so sweet to behold ever so sweetfinal note kudos to producer nick raskulinecz for helping to facilitate this brilliance that was brewing close to the surface waiting to explode into this fantastic new album to rush fans the role hes played since first producing the band on snakes and arrows is well known and well documented i sensed the greater possibility for this moment with every new piece of information that surfaced between these two albums his contribution is immeasurable also thanks to nick and to richard chycki for helping to once again achieve a sonically amazing albumclockwork angels is a masterpiece|1
my 2 12 year old granddaughter loves  music and listens to raffi in the car and at home mellow music and lively at the same time|1
for reasons unknown to me i am just now becoming a huge fan of this bands music  this cd without a doubt will go down as one of the greatest|1
sorry if that offends but it was the image that immediately sprang to mind when i heard gary morris what one looks for in a new recording for a show is the new artists interpretation of the work what gary morris provides is a bad carbon copy of colm wilkinsons performance right down to vocal inflection and pronunciation i really have no issue with the rest of the casts vocal performance because they are at times so very different from the approach of the broadway and london recordings i really dont know why i subconciously chose patton oswalt as the face for the voice i was hearing but its the one that stuck perhaps because i find it so ridiculously amusing that someone with a broadway caliber voice would go to that much trouble to sound like someone else|0
it was scratched and it skips now i wish i could really listen to it congratulations you managed to make even the beatles sound bad|0
had i received the proper cd  even though the shrink wrap around the cd said christmas with the chipmunks a totally different cd was shipped to me  amazon made good on the mistake but i cant find the chipmunk cd i want anywhere|0
easy to read enjoyable  somewhat like a fairy tale  could use a little more depth but fairy tale level is what this isas a companion to the album its fun  the book is based off the album somewhat an independent work so not necessary to read to enjoy the albumi actually miss reading it may check out some more of his books|1
this is my alltime favorite cd of african popular music  the tracks are alternately infectious and uptempo and deeply moody and sorrowful  apparently informed by mr oryemas heartsickness over the political turmoil in his homeland  the result is a consistently tasteful and affecting blend of cultural influences that has remained a top fave on my cd rack for many years  i actually played it for my boyfriend a musician on our first date and weve been together almost ten years  he found it to be a revelation as well i havent felt quite the same connection with mr oryemas later work but exile is a gem|1
loved the entire cd it brought back memories of family gatherings and the music i was raised with music that my parents loved and instilled in us|1
is an exclent disc contents beautiful songs they sing very very good|0
i bought this a few years back  it has no material of interest and is almost unlistenable  it sounds like it was recorded inside a washing machine  avoid this one at all costs|0
i rarely take a record off before i have heard it in its entirety but i must say i was totally turned off by tan duns pretentious unmelodic score as well as by the incomprehensible libretto this composer should stick to movie music for which he is so much better suited  the one opera in my collection i am sure never to play again|0
ive read tons of reviews saying how heavy this album is and how its easily the best album of the tony martin era of sabbath for beginnerswhat a load of crapthe album suffers from several factors first of all its keyboarddrenched 80s production thin guitar tone and overly prominent vocals kill any chance the songs had of displaying any kind of heaviness or atmosphere tony martin is certainly a capable vocalist falling somewhere between ronnie james dio and fates warning singer ray alder in terms of vocal range and tone however previous sabbath vocalists were unique stood out and had a part in making the music unique and vibrant martin does none of this he just belts out high note after high note of pseudosatanic imagery over campy pseudohair metalgone are the memorable riffs of songs like sweet leaf symptom of the universe heaven and hell and zero the hero iommi seems content to churn out generic guitar lines over boring overproduced drum beats and tonally thin bass lines this is black sabbath only in name it fails to capture the spirit of excitement and dread that the best sabbath recordings conjure uphowever i will say that iommis lead playing has improved by leaps and bounds and his solos as always are a treat to listen to|0
what can i say another solid effort by the one and only great band and good classic rock sound good drinking music|1
i was encouraged by the previous review to pop this cd in my player and give it a listen  i like world jazz if its good  this stuff  itselevator music  or sitting in the dentists chair music  but it is not music you should go out of your way to buy|0
unfortunately this version is predictably disappointed as freni and domingo bear no any comparison with los angeles and gedda no french style no enough understanding no normal french language certainly both of them freni and domingo are great singers i like them but they are not up to the mark of this music product at all if you start singing in french your listener is not interested of you dont know it and of you dont understand what you are singingbut if you fan of freni or domingo  just enjoy|0
i really enjoyed feedback by polar and im a tough reviewer  so i gambled on living incinerator and lost  not a single good song  sound and vocals very different from feedback  save yourself some |0
ive been listening to clockwork angels almost nonstop for 3 days now and i still cant get enough of it it really is a complete piece and in my opinion their best album since counterparts and maybe even better than that one of the things i like most about it is that they seem to borrow a little bit here and there from throughout their entire catalogue the solo in headlong flight for example sounds like something straight off one of their 70s albums while tracks like the wreckers have the even tempered melody youd expect from a signals or moving pictures songevery rush album is a unique and experimental endeavor and so its hard to compare clockwork angels to any of their previous work but on its own id say this album has a little bit of everything for a rush fan to like it has some of the heaviest songs on it that ive heard from the band in a long time and the mastering is really well done you can really feel the bass and drums booming at you on this albumill admit i was a little disappointed by vapor trails and snakes and arrows but if this is the new direction the band is going im definitely on board for the ride and cant wait to hear whats next|1
sutherlands performance in the first act was shockingly inept it was painful to listen to her struggle vainly to reach the notes to pronounce the text her desperate ineffectual efforts to sing the role brought tears to my eyes could not her husband have set down his baton given back their fees and refused to go on could noone have squelched this release out of respect for her caballeacute and pavarotti are in good voice and caballeacute makes the wimpy adelgesa a suddenly compelling role however sutherland deserves not to have been disrespected in this way  it made me furious for her the masters should have been burned|0
my three year old and her 1 12 year old brother love this collection  with three cds we have one in the car one in her room and one in the family room  the songs are memorable and fun  both kids are starting to sing along even when we arent listening to the cds|1
the wall might not be the perfect album it is a bit too long the narrative doesnt completely hold up it can be gimmicky etc  but it is also a triumph of ambitious songwriting  roger watters by this time  floyds creative driving force was trying to articulate his feelings  regarding his fathers wartime death bandmate syd barrets druginduced  madness and his alienation from his own audience  on all three points he  succeeds brilliantly  another brick in the wall part two  pink floyds only charttopping song is one of the most misunderstood hits  of all time  not perfect but a masterpiece nonetheless|1
the people that are willing to pay 50 for this cd would be wise to spend it on professional help instead i had this cd once i listened to it a couple of times ut nothing in it made me think id ever want to hear it again los tres is a truly boring band its even more boring on this cd as they attempt to tackle boleros rockabilly and cuecas to boot on the last 3 or 4 tracks there are 2 guests on this cd unknown to all but a small part of the chilean population and no chile is not in mexico you ignorant gringoupdate  this cd is thankfully out of print hopefully forever but if you still want it it is available through bit torrent downloads for free not apenny should reach these roto chilenos for this piece of garbage|0
when you think of pantera you most likely think of the pantera we know and love with phil anselmo vinnie paul abbott etc but somehow somewhere this strange yet eerie album crept into the search results for pantera very creepy music indeed especially track 4listen if you dare|0
if youre a fan of the original aeon flux animation by peter cheung then buy this album by drew neumann its all the original music from the show great arrangements with punchy rhythms and cool melodies sinister and fun|1
this recording is a work that i can listen to several times a day without  getting tired of it  i hear the music with my ears but i feel it in my  hear as im reminded how true god is to us and how much he loves  uskathy troccolis devotional book my life is in your hands  is also a tremenduous work  anyone who is having a hard time or just needs  to be reminded of the faithfulness of god needs to get this book|1
sorry but i hated this cd  while its true that i have a large cd collection still theres only room in it for one version of each work  this should not be your first or your only version of the brandenburgs  if you want to study bach and are interested in every possible permutation of his compositions then fine buy this disc  for the ordinary collector it is not suitable  i feel cheated because when i bought this cd there was certainly no indication on the packaging that this is a variant version of the concertos  had i had the information contained in the liner notes when i was trying to decide whether to purchase it i would not have  i have no problem with the use of authentic instruments and i ordinarily enjoy hogwoods and the aams recordings but this is not the normal traditional version of the brandenburg concertos the sound quality was not good the playing is abrasive and i frankly think that anyone who like me loves classical music but is no expert will just find listening to this cd an ordeal  dont buy it if you are really intrigued at least try listening to it before you plunk down your cash|0
i heard a cut from this album on sirius satellite radio and immediately went out and bought the album from itunes  i really did not know what to expect but i have been listening nonstop for the past three days at workthe music is very hard and driving but still very easy to listen to over and over  the vocals are amazing and the music is incredible as well  i cannot find anything that i really dislike about this album and i like every single track which is a pretty rare find latelyi think that the comparisons to evanescense are way off mark  there is nothing alike between the two save the fact that they both have female lead vocalists but in my opinion lacey blows amy out of the water in all resepects  i really hope that there is going to be more to come from this band as they are one of the really great ones out there currentlymany people may be put off by the fact that they are a christian metal band but they are on tour with korn and i am making the journey to see them just to see flyleaf although i do like korngive this one a chance and i suspect that you will not be dissapointed|1
i have listened to this album before there were cds and i will forever continue to listen to whatever form of disk or whatever you put music onto into the next millenium  this has to be one of the most comforting  recordings to me that there was ever printed  it soothes the soul in times  of confusion and doubt simply put in the words of someone very wise to  meoutstanding  thank you david gilmour and roger waters|1
one of the best recordings put out by the best canadian power rock trio ever thank you rush for consistently producing great music|1
michael has captured the true atmosphere of christmas in this album an atmosphere that stays throughout the album  he cleverly mixes classical choral and orchestral pieces with more contempory work to create a seamless  movement that seems to take you through the story of christs birth and the  wonder of it whether smitty was trying to acheive this or not i am not  sure but it is truely wonderful you need to listen to this album over and  over to really get into the depths of whats going on here  all i can  say is that it truely touches me each time i listen to it i mean  god  with us emmanuel our redeemer comes this album is far greater than the  sum of its parts and as a complete work it stands unique and is my 1 all  time favourite album for christmas  if you dont have it get it god bless  you|1
the vinyl pressing is defective and of a very poor quality there are too many scuffs scratches clicks and pops its really sad when you consider there are pressing plants in the world today devoted to producing superior quality vinyl records clearly emiapple for reasons unknown to me have chosen a pressing plant with quality control issues  i am very disappointed with the overall quality of the vinyl i can only hope emiapple may produce a second run of pressings and team up with a pressing plant devoted to quality control maybe someone like rti or mobile fidelity sound labs could take control of the pressingsin the world of beatles box sets many editions andor pressings have been produced down thru the years in my collection i happen to own 1 the 1978 parlophone beatles bc 13 blue box set and 2 the 1982 mobile fidelityemi  box set pressed by the victor company  in japan on virgin vinyl  if i were to put aside all questions comments criticisms andor debates regarding the mastering of the recordings and merely focus on the quality of the vinyl  well its easy  the 1982 vinyl pressings are clearly the gold standard  the 1978 pressings come in at second place and the new 2012 pressings are dead last again i can only hope emi apple might consider a second run of pressings with a manufacturer  devoted to superior audiophile quality|0
i played this disc factory new on a brand new cd player and it would not play without skips and stops and starts on each song  i returned the disc thinking it was defective and the replacement copy did the same thing  since the earlier release of this cd in the jewel case plays fine it has to be something about this remastered version that my player doesnt like  if i were you id try one out before you buy the whole collection in remastered form|0
i notice there seems to still be this competition with some vh fans that wont die and never will so i thought i would put my two cents worth in herei love the new van halen record adkot but that does not mean i am suppose to dislike this record like some people have decided they are both great i do favor the new vh more but thats not to say this is not an excellent record it is i was and still am a fan of vh with dlr and hagar and now chickenfoot as well its nice to have this much good rnr these days we should all feel blessed we do by the way for young ones still learning sammys music check out his fantastic solo record standing hampton|1
i love brian regan but i believe you need to see him to totally enjoy him  i made the mistake of ordering a cd rather than a dvd didnt enjoy it very much  as for the dvds i loved them  he is the greatest|0
the rating should really be 45 starsi started to get into pink floyd about a year and a half ago and since then i have bought four of their albums  meddle atom heart mother that littleknown one with the prism on the cover and the wall while i dont think that the wall is the best of them it is nonetheless a great albumtelling the story of a rock stars complete and total breakdown the wall put out what is probably pink floyds bestknown song  another brick in the wall pt 2 its a pretty good song but not near the best on the album i couldnt possibly name one definitive best track on this album but there are plenty of great ones  comfortably numb the trial hey you young lust and more however if you want to listen to this album do not skip around and only listen to a few tracks this is one of those alubms that needs to be listened to in its entirety whether its your first or twentieth time listening to itthe lyrics on this album are great and tell a very interesting story but the instrumental work is also topnotch the perfect example of this is david gilmours solo in comfortably numb also when listening to this album you wont only hear vocals and instruments  there are plenty of other sounds and even a hidden message which is infinitely cooler than any other hidden messages such as satanic worship in stairway to heaven the sounds arent completely random nor do they lower the quality of the albumi cant bring myself to give this album a perfect 5star rating but its very close overall the wall is well worth your hardearned dough a mustbuy for any fan of classic rock|1
hellraiser i and ii still stand today as some of the greatest horror movies ever made from the surreal atmosphere to the makeup to the music to the disturbing characterization theres a reason that pinhead the chatterer and all of the other cenobites have become cinematic iconshellraiser iii on the other hand has almost nothing in common with its predecessorshellraiser iii essentially ignores the movies that came before it ripping out the fantastic atmosphere of the first two films and replacing with a pathetic runofthemill slasher movie  pinhead previously depicted as leviathans aweinspiring instrument of torture is here transformed into another wisecracking freddy krueger ripoff  the fact that this obnoxious freddypinhead has such an enormous presence throughout the film is a major flaw  until this film hellraiser was never about pinhead  it was about the connection between pleasure and pain it was about the puzzle box it was about frank and julias sick relationship  and pinhead in his limited role as the lead cenobite was a hell of a lot more interesting than the freddyclone depicted in this filmeverything in this movie is for lack of a better term hellraiserlite the eerily disfigured cenobites of the previous films are replaced with gimmicky imitations  the sadism gore and general offensiveness of the movie is turned up a notch as if the movie is aware of how sickeningly weak it is and is relentlessly trying to shock the audience into submissionmany people are quick to forgive some of hellraiser iiis flaws due to how unbelievably terrible the later hellraiser films were  but im not one of those people  as far as im concerned hellraiser iii is an insult to clive barkers the hellbound heart an insult to the first two hellraiser films and an insult to horror movies in general|0
like many horror films and nearly all horror sequals this was a bad movie with some very cool scenes  buy it used enjoy them and lament what could have been|0
how can anyone consider this album to be dark and depressing and not that good the wall is a great album which i believe is not dark and depressing at all it actually makes me happy every time i listen to it and just gets me in a good mood unfortunately the only songs ive ever heard from it on the radio are comfortably numb i believe two times and young lust hey you and another brick in the wall part 2 one time each in fact besides those songs the only floyd songs ive ever heard on the radio are time at least 6 or 7 times wish you were here twice us and them twice and brain damage and eclipse once thats it i just dont understand why people keep on saying floyd songs are being constantly played on the radio because i for one have been hearing them a lot more often lately but still do not hear them as often as people have said i dont believe any pink floyd song has been played to death anyway the wall truly is one of the best albums ever made but please take the time to only listen to it in its entirety this is the definitive concept album and tells such a remarkable story that songs out of the concept just do not sound good without the other songs to back them up long live the wall|1
the full length album is a tiny bit less raw than the ep but i say thats a good thing lacey has a great voice and though she doesnt do it very often she can scream its amazing the song cassie is a superpowerful one about the girl in the columbine shooting who was shot because she said she believed in god a very hardcore rock album i recommend it if you like project 86 thousand foot krutch andor blindside|1
track 1 is the best on the cd lively good flute good travelin music  need more stuff like this  cd is faily short as well probably 30 minutes|0
this album is really good it has a clear rush vibe combined with a modern sound it has moments it reminds me of the parts of presto i liked without the cheesy 90s pop and a bit of their attempt to reconnect with rocking roots named counterparts  but more sophisticated there are parts of this that remind me of primus and tool as well  both of whom were clearly influenced by rushone of the last times i saw rush liveniel pert couldnt do his drum solo it looked like they had to bring him oxygen and the performance fell short then later the snakes and ladders album fell completely flat for me so  i wrote off rush as an old man band and hoped they wouldnt fade ungracefully into the night like the rolling stones or more embarrassingly zz top and aerosmithi am happy to say  this is not the case they are back in a big way with this album and man am i happy i inherited early rush albums on vinyl and cassette ranging from fly by night to grace under pressure and rush was one of the first bands i saw live permanent waves and moving pictures are still two of my favorite albums  and its a pleasure to hear solid new material from the same team of musicians that made that magicthe emotions and nostalgia of youth tend to cement favorite albums in a position that simply cannot be replaced once one is older  no matter how good the new material is so  while this will never hit the sweet spot of those early albums in my early life  if one were a teen again  and this is the first musical manna from the trio one experiences  would rank up there with their bestin the end i dont think this stands out as much in terms of music and lyrical innovation as the late 70s80s era rush i would give this 45exceptanything this good from guys this old who have made 20 albums  you just have to give 55 to step back and applaud|1
this is pink floyd on the brink  of madness of splitting up of civil war of literary profundity or as near as rock music gets to it its almost a roger waters solo project and occasionally has that feel about it but the other three quarters of the band always add something extra which elevates above anything remotely normalthe album is a precarious balancing act between roger waters sortof life story and a generalised ode to the evil of human existence rogerpink is gradually screwed up by anyone who cares to know him  a father killed in the war daddy what you leave behind for me an overbearing mother of course mamas gonna help build the wall teachers from hell pouring their derision on anything we did wives doctors fellow rock musicians and various addictive substances brick by brick the wall is built completing rogerpinks alienation from society until he becomes a lonely isolated wornout scarred broken man its a sad story of rocking excess parental mistreatment and psychological damage rogerpink eventually falls back into a form of protofascism as he forgets the words to his songs and the worms of madness enter his headthis is a highly ambitious project and sometimes is doesnt quite come off all pf albums were marked by some light touches but its a fine line between light touches and pathos which the wall sometimes falls into but the album is carried by brilliance in almost every department there are lyrics that stay with you forever and even phrases are laced with genius hey you comfortably numb is there anybody out there we dont need no education the music is incredible and some guitar riffs rock you like you aint never been rocked before hey you comfortably numb in the flesh the instruments and voices are all in fine form particularly the hilarious trial and the sound effects are as superb as everlisten to this album its important a it says something about life art and the dangers of both b the music and lyrics are both amazing the wall is not just about rogerpink but about us all  we can all decline get screwed up and act like this hey you  watch out   |1
what are the other songs not on the soundtrack especiallysomething like everyone gets lonely sometime anyoneknow title and artist|0
i could listen to this music for hours slashs playing is so awesome to listen to lots of solos myles kennedy is an awesome vocalist|1
such happy fun bouncy sing along songsfor kids of all agesi remember singing them to kids i babysat when i was 13and now im singing them to my babyjust plain fun|1
i love this comedian hes so funny and clean too thats hard to find ill put this in while im driving and be laughing so hard and have tears running down my face i know i look like a fool but its funny its really cool though when you find out your friends like him too and randomly say his lines around you my friends young son does that and it throws me off and makes me laugh every time|1
if wooly wolstenholmes hauntingly beautiful keys and vocals were your favorite bjh component forget this album wooly was long gone and the remaining band members were only trying to please their record label with short unsatisfying pop dribble i was disappointed john lennons guitar a great live tune was absolutely terrible and far shorter as a studio cut on this cd run dont walk from this one bjh is capable of good short pop songs try face to face not here though yuck|0
some one lifted my old anthony newley cd  i decided to try this one and am disappointed  the recording doesnt quite right|0
always innovative rush takes the concept album to new heights a challenge to any other band why this was not a grammy winner well well never understand the entire collection is incredible as is any track taken individually anyone sick of 3040 year old bands who ride the coattails of their old favorites rejoice that is not rush and never has been and probably never will be when they can no longer innovate im sure they will find something even more fascinating to do|1
i dont even like this type of music i like techno but this album is amazing its almost ambient i wish i had it on vinyl so much   it contains so much emotion its more a work of art then an album each song  seems carefully arranged to give the right effectohh its great|1
it seems that anything sammy hagar is involved with has an energy and vibe that just makes you want to party  i mean come on the guy is going to be 63  thats why hes called the red rocker  this album is no exception  it has that same energy and coupled with other band members of their own stature  its a no brainer this is a superband of rock great album its a must haveandy5150  cincinnati|1
all of the songs here are goodhowever  some of michael w smiths best songs came from 1985 and earlier but he very conspicuously ignores those songs which i think is rather odd  and the friends version is a remake from many many years later not the original amy grantmws version from this time periodjust off the top of my head he left off wiredforsound rocketown hosanna i am sure im up restless heart could he be all major hits on the 198385 charts  perhaps he should have used two discs instead of just one disc to cover his first decade so that he could more accurately represent his discography  as it stands now a proper title would be 198793 since the early years are so poorly representeddisappointing|0
just for information the vinyl version is a totally different recording than the cd version which is a new recording made a number of years later the vinyl version is not inferior at all it was just an artists decision to rerecord the songs digitally so for a collector this is important|1
i have nothing else much to add except it reminds me a bit of presto which is a good thingi was not a fan of sa and i feared rush would continue in that directionim so glad they didnt|1
yes i recall hearing a version of this as a kid this version with patrick stewart brings back the memory and then some|0
a great commedy routine  funny for all he relates to things from all walks of life  i would recommend to anyone|1
i was most disappointed in this item it was a christmas present when the cd arrived i was frustrated to see it was not in the original case rather it was in a homemade case further the cd wouldnt play after trying on a number of cd players cd was sold for likd new but that was false representation thia is the only negative experience with an amazon purchase|0
the sound quality was not crisp and it sounded like a poor transfer of music it sounds okay on my computer sound system but on my high quality audio system the sound lacks clarity|0
if you can get past perlmans swooning vibratoimmersed violin playing the rather thin sound of this live recording which by the way is noted nowhere in the liner notes on the cd or on the back of the jewel box and the intrusive applause then well you might enjoy these performances perhaps not of course since these are live performances a certain latitude must be given however that said i still find this brahms wanting too often if anything barenboim pulls more interesting detail from this music than does perlman whose closelymiked violin tends to constantly overshadow his partners piano these artists try admirably but there are simply too many moments of sloppy stilted ensemble work too much pointing and an overall sense that an imbalance exists in more than just the recording itselfrunning time  6550|0
i am unemployed just layed off cannot sleep for days suffering from ptsd and ordered this cd because of the recommendations this was the biggest waste of moneythe music is like scratching a chalk board and there are no subliminal messages in it at all do not buy this|0
a a former professional musician i did not care for some of the solos performed sounded like they were self taught|0
i gave this set only one star due to heavy static on disc two not the performances themselves  as you may already know other reviews here report this problem  i purchased this set hoping that my copy would be fine but this was not to be  there is a singledisc dgg set that contains all of these performances except for the 27th and no reviews of that set report sound problemsdisc one contains the performances of the 8th and 23rd  let me comment on the 8th  i am no authority on mozarts piano concertos but i listen to them almost every day and happen to favor the early ones over the later  i have had two versions of the 8th  by ashkenazy and perahia  and the kempff version has become my favorite  for all the lovers of mozart it is a shame that there are so few recordings of his piano concertos by this exquisite interpreter|0
one of the things i liked best about this cd is that it teaches you how to meditate in just a few minutes a day i have a full time job and am a full time student both of which cause a lot of stress in my daily life but with this method i learned how to take just a few minutes out of my busy day and calm my mind so that i can complete my activities with a clear mental state the introduction is very helpful because it reassures the listener that they dont need to make a big production about meditation and that they can do it wherever they are most comfortable i would reccomend this product to anyone who needs a little assistance getting the clutter out of their minds so that they can work play or even sleep more easily|1
my kids grew up on raffi and now the grandkids are fans  loaded these songs onto my itunes and iphone we have them wherever we go  the actual cds sit in the car cd player for easy listening the minute the key turns in the ignition very pleased|1
i purchased this album during a severe attack of nostalgia and regretted it immediately every songs is performed the same way starts out nice and quiet and then builds to a screaming cacophony of noise it might help if you understand french which i dont you can buy my copy for very little|0
my first reviewumm this cd is awsome the girl that sings in the band has an awsome voice with some small screaming parts that are great its not like most chick screamers all high piched and stuff i really enjoy it|1
sunny boy williamsons bluebird recordings 1938 is a terrific cd  and it is definitely worth owning if you already have his bluebird recordings 19371938 or his bluebird recordings 19391940 because it is really volume ii of those fine recordings however as ive painfully found out twice while the 1938 bluebird recordings are listed used on amazon at reasonable prices  what two sellers actually wound up sending me was the 19371938 bluebird recordings cd why most likely they were confused because unfortunately amazon is showing the incorrect picture under this listing while the heading says bluebird recordings 1938 and track listings are indeed from bluebird recordings 1938 starting with the song honey bee blues the picture is of bluebird recordings 19371938 which starts with the song good morning little schoolgirl further confusing things is the fact that the 19371938 bluebird recordings cd appears no where else on the site if youre scratching your head join the club both recordings are out of print but as ive found out twice the 19371938 recordings are a lot easier to come by  and a fine place to start if you have neither come to think of it both cds are worth having and i should know i now have three but not for someone who already has one or the other whats the solution amazon should of course list both cds with the correct pictures and playlists to make it easy for sellers to figure out which one they have but until they update the listing sellers should take the initiative and include years and play lists in their product description so buyers can tell if they are selling the 1938 recordings or 19371938 recordings or even the 3940 recordings whew who said buying used cds had to be easy|0
are you seriously kidding me this is like 3000 for one cd i mean it is just a load of crap i will never buy this unless they lower the price majorly|0
this is a release by rhino and its all authentic perry but these same songs are available on many other releases and are of much better quality|0
greetings to everyone at amazoncomi received the album pink floyd the wall a while ago and listened to it immediately when i got it and saw a big error that probably came from the cd printing company there are 2 cds the first one is good nothing wrong with it exeptthe second one its a beatles cd like the beatles movie soundtrackso i figured it must have been a misprint of some sort and probably those 2 bands are with the same label so they mixed it up when printing there must be many more of the same kind in wich you are selling and probably other customers had had the same experience as me so maybe check that outps i guess its to late to get a refund for that double disc and i respect that its my fault but check that out carefullycheerschad|0
chickenfoot proves once again you dont have to be young to be at the top of your game great catchy hardrockin songs here all killer no filler it amazes me how prolific satriani is these days always writing new material either for his solo work and now chickenfoot very inspiring love hagars no bs attitude on these songs just belting away putting any singer around his age to shame or really half his age as well the record gets better and better each listen although it only takes one listen to get into this stuff that always means you got something great on your hands favorite tracks are last temptation up next come closer lighten up big foot and no change no change is badass i love that satriani once again reminds everyone whos the boss on guitar|1
i always thought that canaries werent supposed to sing norma  that is until i heard edita gruberova in vienna  beautiful voice  beautiful sound  very good interpretation with high notes reminiscing young joan sutherland but only better  sadly i cannot say that about joan sutherland  as always she sings wihout passion  garbled pronunciation of italian words horrendous state of her middle voice undesirable mezza voce it puzzles me why many people would run after these divas who sing norma with a ton of hot airand thats it  puzzles me a lot really  i mean how on earth can people sing norma without emoting their voice in singing  its atrocious  youd think that a few years later sutherlands dramatic insight would improve but no  and they caught her voice at a very bad time too  callas as always will be the sublime definitive norma even until the end of her career where her voice had begun to fade  at least she still conveyed the needed emotions for this role  caballe could do norma well too and recently miricioiu and gruberova  if renee fleming will do norma then well have another great druid priestess on record  not la stupenda  it was a good thing that only very few records of her were preserved on tape  otherwise i would have recommended her live norma from san francisco  that at least is dramatically right  in this record caballe can of course sing the role of adalgisa but i think she was better suited as the priestess  i cant say the same about pavarotti  i still think corelli is the best pollione ever  avoid sutherlands studio normas  sure there is good singing but you dont get to hear what norma is supposed to sound like  besides bonynge always conducts sloppily unlike serafin who is the singers conductor and possibly the greatest conductor of all time|0
the 2 star rating has nothing to do with the music its self the quality of the recording is excellent as is the music perfectly good to listen tomy complaint is i bought this cd under the impression that the songs were a certain length 5 6 minute long each instead there are three very different songs all crammed onto one track i host actual english country balls where i teach the dances and i need music that is at least four minute long  for each dance i believed the three names on the track were just some of the dances this song could be used forthe three names on each track are three very different both in speed and the use if instruments songs so each song winds up being only about one and a half minutes long instead of the five and six minutes i thought they were and because they are all different tempos you cannot just dance through all three songsso if you just want some great music to listen to then this will be perfect but if you are looking for music you can actually dance english country dancing to then i would suggest you find something else|0
in typical rush form the songs are well structured and rhythmical and it is clear that all members take advantage of rocking out with their instruments the arrangements are great as are the songs nick r brings out some cool things but i think a lot of fans have become accustomed to the mode terry brown operated in and what he brought out of rush as geddy himself said rush is about moving forward and exploring new heights and new waysrush is one of the greatest rock bands of all time period|1
i recently reviewed the wall live in berlin and would be  remiss if i didnt review the original albumthis was definately rogers  best work and told a gripping story of a man who lost his father to a  horrid war had an overprotective mother and became an international rock  starwannabe hitlerthis is taken from a lot of reallife experiences  from roger and you can tell by listening to this that the pain was  realbottom line  if you never buy a pink floyd album or the live  recording of the wall get this album|1
the many beatles songs presented on this cd are first rate and about half are classics most people should really enjoy them  the remastered sound quality is very good for a cd  one should be aware before purchasing this cd its not the help movie soundtrack which is not clarified by the amazon editorial review written by jim emerson located below the cd this cd  fails to capture the essence of the movie and does not include the instrumental beatles music performed by an orchestra unlike the real help soundtrack and issued usa only as a soundtrack this is stated in the cd booklet back in 65 on vinyl for some reason now out of print includes seven beatles songs performed by the beatles along with orchestra instrumentals as  follows side one orchestra of 007  leading  into the song  help the night before orchestra of an accumulation of beatles songs youve got to hid your love away i need you orchestra of some zany moments in the move side two another girl instrumental using the sitar of hard days night ticket to ride orchestra your goanna lose that girl instrumental using the sitar thats the original motion picture soundtrack as stated on the front cover of the capitol vinyl album the sound quality of this vinyl album in full dimensional stereo is outstanding after looking closely at the cd nowhere does it state motion picture soundtrack|0
brian regan is one of the funniest comedians ive heard  his material covers circumstances most of us have encountered in our lives such as take luck and you too  ive heard this album before and it still cracks me up every time|1
this was an easy way to the the latest rush album fast and easy and has its own cloud  i was able to bring the files into itunes no problem|1
ive been a rush fan for 7 years now and own all their albums on cd i loved this album the entire story being told has a sense of wonder and discovery about it there arent and bad songs on here none that i will skip on impulse all the songs are fun and the guys are still playing as strong as ever a must buy for rock fans|1
it is a fun journey through a lifelong tale in the fashion of the fountain of lamneth the music is definitely superior to their last few studio releases not that i would ever bash a rush release but songs like bu2b and headlong flight really kick it up a notch it is a completely different style from caress of steel and 2112 which is what a lot of people compare it to because it is modern heavy progressive and has none of the classic shrill vocal and gutteral crunch i am also all for less midi crap and more just playing the 3 instruments |1
thank you all for the reviews  good and bad  on the new rush album clockwork angels i have read all the reviews here and i must say i was a little suprised at some of the more negative comments about the cd must admit that when i first listened to ca i thought that it was ok after reading some comments here i started to listen to it over and over and over again and boom i get it i think now that this album is one of their best in a very long time i love the early stuff  my personal favs are 2112farewell to kingshemispheres  and the latter but this album is great i wont go into the track listings bc others have already done so i just wanted to give this album a little time to grow on me and it has im over 50 and have seen rush live since 1975 all i can say is for 3 men who can continue to write and record great music at their age more power to them what an album|1
i have only heard  her music through the radio because i would never waste my money on her cd  what ive heard from her tells me that she shouldnt have tried to make it in the music world  i wouldnt recommend this cd to  anyone because like i said its just a waste of money and time that you  spend listening to her cd|0
its good but mellow not as heavy as i like  if you like acoustical more than heavy give it a shot|1
well i bought this cd to play for my babys party but honestly some of the songs was kind of irritating the sing a long songs cd is the best|0
i do appreciate these works on the cd by a good technical player however the inconsistant pitch and tone quality were a disappointment|0
lyrics music guitar bass drums etc is welded together to make the best rock album of the yearevery song is ipod worthy|1
bernstein achieved what i hope to if my ambitions to become a conductor are fullfilledhe was an american icon  this recording is a wonderful example of much of an icon he wasthis recording stands as an example of american freedom  a symbol of our hopes in the modern ageartisically its wondeful  the accoustics are not the greatest nor the orchestra  you can tell they were thrown together and are not a tight groupas far as their skill as an orchestra and their ability to tackle the challenging depths of this symphony goesthey are fine  i think bernstein in typical fashion over exaggerates the dynamics  he overplays it as though berlioz wrote this  however i could barely hear the basses my instrument  introduce the joy theme  they played good but not loud enoughso i think overall its greattempos are all a little slow but is otherwise fine here|0
wow this is the best album since clockwork angelsseriously though i like it and i think thats what counts makes me wonder if theyll ever make a 2113 or a farewell to queens maybe something like counterpointsif twisted sister came out with an album today i would suspect it would sound likewelltwisted sister from the 80sthis band moves forward and have persevered thoughout their career this album proves thatits good i like it|1
this album is just as great as i remember it in high school|1
ive seen rush 23 times in concert and own every album is it even possible that they are still somehow getting more mature and just better  the fact that that is the case astounds me i am going to say that this is the best and most dynamic album theyve ever put forth but then realize that will probably only last until the next album  i have no idea how 12 people could give this album 1 star but those are usually the same people who go the concert and say i just came to hear tom sawyer and spirit of radio  the last song the garden is one of my all time favorite rush songs already its simply haunting the wreckers 7 cities of gold etcthere is no bad song on this album like there ever is do not contemplate getting this albumsimply purchase it and see for yourself  i cant wait to see them on the opening night of the tour in manchester nh awesome album|1
this was the worst album the floyd ever made in his egomania waters had a stipulation that included the proviso on the original album music by rogerwaters played by pink floyd wow if it hadnt been for gilmour the floyd would have died after barrett left this galaxy this album is concerned primarily with rogers obsession about his fathers death in wwiino one actually blamed him for this it is an earth shaking trauma but waters infinite whining and bitterness just kept getting harder to endurei had been following pink floyd since their first tour in the us i saw them in concert first at an abandoned tire factory in philadelphia back in the early 70s or late 60s and then every subsequent concert they played in the us waters basically just started to go crazy around animals and in this album he became unendurable this was the last album before the breakup and thank god gilmour wright and masonendured in the lawsuit roger brought on to dissolve the band btw the album the band released after the breakup became their biggest selling album this album is hard to take even for a pink floyd fanatic|0
if you happen to be one of the few who understand the meaning of the wall and dont think of it as some kind of dope music then you will know what im talking about here most people think of us as a very drug oriented group of course were not david gilmour or all that media stuff is all very irrelevant really and if the music doesnt move you then whats the point roger waters so what im getting at is this if you will listen to the following albums you find themes in each one which are one part of the walls main theme  for example from meddles echoes so i throw the windows wide and call to you across the skies a lost love and from dark side of the moon any song desperation insanity and death and from animals all tracks the evils of government and politics and from the final cut all tracks the death of his father in wwii also make note that all themes are in reverse order and well ill leave the rest to anyones open mind also make note that there are three main themes involved enter the triangleprism on dark side i shall also leave the white light converted to color to your own interpretations nevertheless what we have here is a very extensive epic saga told through brilliant music and lyrics it seems so sad that so many people dont get it at all|1
i believe this remaster will be considered one of the great sonic blunders of the cd age there is too much compression on this thing it doesnt breathe it doesnt feel in any way like a true performance they were tempted by the sirens of compression and they could not resist|0
i return this cd to the store really disgusted i dont find in it the theme of melrose place television series when is supposed to be there i know that many people suffer thatsame bad experience but the worst thing iswhere i can find it i apreciate the information like many others i am a fan of melrose place series and i hope that somebody can tell me at least which is the group that plays on it in that way i wil try to find something about their musici will appreciatethanks|0
i would recommend this product to all those who already know and love thich nhat hahn and for those who are unfamiliar and are seeking ways to peace comfort and joy|1
one extremely important detail one should notice before watching the thorn birds 2  the missing years 96 is that richard chamberlain is the only member of the original thorn birds cast to return for this revisioning of the classic miniseries from 83that one simple fact says volumes about what lies ahead for the unfortunate viewer no matter how much one may like richard chamberlain this is not a onemanshow and the supporting cast of fillins do little to make this one believable or acceptabletouted as an inbetweener rather than a sequel the storyline looks backward to explore events left out of the first miniseries new situations and encounters between the two forlorn lovers are concocted and the plot strives to add depth and meaning to the film by presenting earlier events intentionally designed to serve as foreshadows of what took place in the 83 production their ploy is unsuccessful and comes across as pretentious rather than thought provokingif you really love the original youre better off not watching this one it offers nothing to help you further appreciate this classic love story between father ralph de bricassart and meggie cleary the thorn birds 2  the missing years simply doesnt work on any level i can perceive however having offered my warning i know youre going to watch it anyway|0
ive been a rush fan for 30 years now ive always thought of them as that somewhat different friend whom your other friends dont quite get they do things you like and love hemispheres and moving pictures they do things that leave you scratching your head presto and they sometimes do things that leave you plain disappointed a show of hands and perhaps a little sheepish however they are so earnest they work so hard they are so honest and they follow a course of their own  so you respect them and remain friends through thick and thin ups and downsthe classic albums will forever be  remember that time when you   and the occasional lows still fondly get remembered with an i still cant believe you plain and simple this album is one of those classic remember that time when you  momentsi truly believe it is one of their strongest albums ever it is tight conceptually instrumentally and sonically it flows from beginning to end as the album has been well dissected here track by track i wont do a deep dive however i do have a couple of recommendations 1  read the protagonists story noted before each songs lyrics before listening it greatly adds to understanding the work and enjoyment of the album2  listen to it loud or through headphones ear buds or some other device that puts the music right into your ears on the first listen i didnt really have any volume behind it and i just didnt get it then i turned it up and it all made perfect sense3  go to a rush concert if you havent before okay thats not related to this album but if you havent gone to see them yet you should  oh and plan a bathroom break during red sector a i could never warm to that live|1
read the track listing young lust has been removed from the album by the chinese government which makes this version the worst ever maybe living in the usa isnt so bad after all|0
i tried this cd after reading its wonderful reviews but get very disappointed the rhythm of all the songs in the cd is truly slow and drowsy even for songs that should bring out passion i feel weary when i listened to the music i dont know why they choose this way to play classical hymns i would prefer to listen to hymns sang by ordinary choir in the church than this one|0
how do i know i have the original on vinyl  there are a lot more songs on that double disc set then there are here  so this is the original but not quite the original  very disappointing|0
expected a higher quality sound but its still flat and one dimensional time for better vm speakers in the mixing room|0
its a great experience the musical biography of two great musicians roger waters and syd barret people just like you and me who built their own wall day by day and in some way or another could brake it down|1
how awesome this cd is i wasnt sure what to expect because i just took a flyer on it after reading some good reviews it took about 20 seconds of im so sick to realize i had made the right call even though thats the song they made a video for its far from the best on the disc so i thought is my personal favorite and one of the beautiful songs ive ever heard cassie is musically and emotionally powerful and my 2 sorrow is the other song that stood out from the pack for me and any of these three songs are worth the price on their own and ohdid i mention that laceys voice is absolutely incrediblei wholeheartedly recommend this to any rock fan i cant seem to stop listening to it and even when i do i cant get the songs out of my head ive heard a lot of music in my time but i can count on one hand the number of albums that have made such an impression on me if you dont buy it youre missing out on something special and another benefit ive discovered is that if you have this you simply dont need any other cds because you can listen to it over and over again and not care if you listen to anything else|1
the technicians  i use that term very loosely that created the cd version should have been fired  sent back to working as shelf stackers at the local supermarket this album has been ruined by technology what more can i saywellhere we go the jewel in the crown has been desiccated by some bozo who has never listened to the original album on record or tape most of the songs on this album must run together without a break in between or it ruins the whole effect its like cutting the mona lisa into 5x3inch glossies to fit into your mums brag book photo album you just wouldnt do it why well for one thing it would be extremely foolish  secondly you cant appreciate the whole picture when looking at tiny pieces of it shame on the morons who were in control  chopped this magnificent album into bits thank heavens i still have the original record  tape so i can hear it as it was meant to be albeit without good sound quality it is sad that in this day  age we do not have the intelligence or ability to faithfully replicate a piece of music they could do it in the sixties  the seventies with their technology but since the eighties to the present day humans have become incapable of such a simple taskto anyone who has heard this album in its original form you will be hugely disappointed by the cd versionfor those who are listening to it for the first time you dont know how much youre missing outits clear that big business really couldnt give a damn about any of us  its clear to see they dont consider themselves professionals when it comes to producing a cd maybe they should let some kid hack it back together for them  should take no more than ten minutesmessage to paul mccartney  ringo starr  how could you let this happen are you so embarrassed by this album or so obscenely rich you dont care how it soundsabbey road|0
i thought when they said the final cut that this would be their last alas unfortunately it wasntfloyd was a bad band in their day but this cd tops it all off in terms of awfulplease people im begging you do not even take a chance on this oneverrry bad verrry verrry bad|0
wow what an album best in years i love the fact that mr peart has laid back and got comfortable the recording is ok a bit muddled i think the garden is the shocker on the whole album rush a ballad fantastic even the wife loved it way to go boys see you in brooklyn and jersey in october|1
short and informative narritive between songs which is neither overly long nor sickenly sweet  the numbers all tend to be plain in the style of the day  the vocal arrangement could use a little more variety  but while the  voices are not louis armstrong and ella fitzgerald they are certainly  adequate and pleasant to listen to  it is well worth the price|1
this book is amazing the concept is great it really makes you wonder if well see something like this in our lifetime the way the author writes is so natural and easy to read the characters speak the way you think so it doesnt seem fake or artificial you will finish this book really quick because there is never a dull moment|1
rush is by far the greatest band i have ever heard  the concerts are incredible and each has proven himself as a worthy musician and songwriter|1
mick jaggers first solo outing is now a very dated 80s relic not without its charms but difficult to take seriouslyi sort of like just another night and lucky in love but the production is so miami vice  pastel  cheery  reaganesque that it is virtually unlistenable now i can just see keith and ronnie giggling over this one and jeff beck playing guitar why i wonder if he was snickering as he picked up his paycheckthis record has its moments and in no way is it as bad as the follow up primitive cool that stinker killed any momentum and goodwill mick had built for a solo career|0
flyleaf is going to take over the metal scene with their heart pounding guitar riffs and emotionally raw lyrical style it looks as though evanescence has some competition  the front woman lacey mosely voice sounds a little like avril but dont be mistaken by this comparison lori mosely can sound like an angelbut can scream as if she were courtney love this band may be metal but surprisingly has a spiritual message hidden behind those loud guitars and that piercing roar of the vocalist that could make ones ears bleedthe breakdown of the songs will be given a rating of 1 to 5 1 being the worst and 5 being the best1im so sick this is the best song on the album lori sounds almost angelic as she sings i will break into your thoughts with whats written on my heart suddenly the singer rips out a powerful roar when she screams i will break break that could break the windows in a house l mosely screeching scream demands attention and will not be ignored 5 great lyrics2fully alive this song is very positive and hopeful the chorus is fueled by l moselys passionate voice that hits every note the lyrics are very original and to the point this song displays the singers powerful pipes 53perfect this song has a spiritual vibe if you listen closely the refrain is quite catchy with energetic melodies the singer admits to her insecurities by singinghow can you look at me when i cant stand myself 54cassie this song is about faith and if you believe  l mosely whispersin the air which sounds haunting this song stands out on the album due to the subject matter55sorrow this song starts out slow but becomes explosive towards the end the lyrics are sung with such passion for just one second i felt whole as you flew right through me represents flyleafs intense lyrical style 56im sorry  i love this song due to the melody and refrain l moselys voice fits this track perfectly the refrain makes you want to jump around the guitars and bass sound refreshingthis song showcases the singers range vocally 57 all around me this song is soft and sweet the best part of the song is when l mosely singsim alive im alive her voice sounds very innocent and beautiful 58 red sam is another amazing song the lyrics are spiritual and hopeful this song annouces the singers strong faith and i worship l mosely repeats 2 more times 59 there for you this song is more about forgiveness and admitting to your flaws it isnt one of my favorites but the melody is catchy along with l moselys heartaching lyrics 310 breathe today the hook is as explosive as a volcano the lyrics are about finding out who you are 511 so i thought could bring your eyes to tears very spiritual and memorable very intense 5buy it now and sprread the word key tracks are im so sick breathe today fully alive so i thought|1
this is quite possibly the best album ever recorded or concieved a long long story of a boy named pink who faces the death of his father an overprotective mother his wife leaving and the pressures of stardom and  due to all of this he secludes himself from the world behind a wall in  the end his punishment is to have this wall torn down there is no hint as  to what happens after the wall is torn down  while i admit some of the  songs seem dull and they seem to drag on the overall theme holds  everything together and songs like in the flesh  mother hey you comfortably numb  run like hell and many others are amazing overall this is  the ultimate story be sure to check out the movie too it clears up some  of the confusion you may have after listening to the album as well as  confuses you with some other things|1
isolated scientific researchers are working their projects separately at the same time but each draws similar concerned conclusions on the phenomena they study  geologist david carter finds an anomaly that frightens him as his research affirms an isolated reverse polarity that he believes is the part of the natural magnetic polar shift that occurs every 65 million years or so  biologist becky sorensen finds a strange frog species that has two extra hind legs in what the scientist wonders might be an abrupt evolutionary change and acts radically different than other amphibians as if they prepare for a radical shift that is scary but it is her aviary and insect findings of changing migratory patterns in terms of direction and time that makes the scientist wonder if the planets magnetic poles are reversing  cdc medical researchers jordan abellard and jillian brookwood are looking into several similar but localized epidemics of sudden death syndrome amongst people of all ages they so far have failed to find the hotspot link that ties the locations together and somehow not spread beyond a particular radius as if being at the wrong place at the wrong time literally means deathsoon each of them and others will understand the greatest crisis to hit humanity has begun  the poles are switching magnetism and none know how to stop  time is running out on what may prove a natural disaster of dinosaur proportionsthis is an exciting science fiction thriller that for about three fourths of the story line sets up the magnetic shift catastrophic disaster  the four lead characters rotate perspective as each with their differing scientific expertise draw the same conclusions  the last part of the novel takes an odd spin pun intended with the description of the shifted earth feeling more metaphysical fantasy than post apocalyptic physical sci fi  still with a strong science base that is not dumped down aj scudieres well written thriller will resonate with the readers as the earth no longer spins on its axis like it has for the last 65 million yearsharriet klausner|1
although i am a big fan of horner this is one of the few scores he has written that i was absolutely dissapointed in it sounds so electronic and has no trace of the orchestral sound the horner is famous for even the  voice choir often heard is enough to drive you crazy and if you ask me it  would have sounded excellent had horner used an actual orchestra and voice  choir this is merely my opinion but horner strayed way to far from his  excellent orchestra style he used in the rocketeer and  willow dont get it|0
i like the music of charlotte church and enya as another reviewer commented i fail to find a comparison between those artists and cecilia she lacks range and i find her intonations rather monotonous save your money and go for charlotte church|0
lacey mosley has an amazing voice  a powerful combination of melody and rage all mixed together after hearing i am so sick and fully alive i got a new energy to burn my calories at the gym check them out its sad most of us dont know about them instead we see all those stupid videos all the time on mtv|1
i give it 2 stars because the berlin phil play desent but rostopovish is just plain awful iv never thought he was even remotly good as a conductor as a cellist i think he is one of the bestskip this one  i cant figure out why so many people and music critics like this recording so muchthe genius tchaikovsky deserves alot betteralso get ernest ansermets versions|0
i bought this for my 4 month old granddaughter the first disc is for the youngest kids she loved the music would laugh and coo especially with peanut butter sandwich and brush your teeth kids are never too young to start listening to wonderful music as she gets older i know shell appreciate some of the other songs raffi was huge in our house when our kids were little and im thrilled that the next generation will enjoy him as well a must have for any kid|1
this is a pathetic attempt for the roger watersless pink floyd to carry on without their heart and soul roger was selfcentered sure but his lyrics and bass were both key parts of the floyd sound that this album horribly misses basically its useless nostalgiac about the early 70s back when they would make ungodly amounts of money off of dark side of the moon and such threequarters floyd decided theyd try to recreate that sound using lots of synthesizers female backing vocals saxes and studio effects the resulting album is far and away pink floyds nadirits hard for me to tell what the albums lowest low is i know i hate the mechanical hit learning to fly but thats not all the dogs of war was voted as pink floyds worst song ever and i must say i agree basically its a pathetic attempt to rewrite the classic dogs  even the titles are similar give me a break here guys arguably even worse than that is signs of life which could very well win the joe strummer most ironic title ever award the rather awkward on the turning way and the a new machineterminal frosta new machine suite i guess the closing sorrow is okay  good guitar part processed and mid80s as it is and i like the lyrics just fine but no way its a nineminute song you know and is that a drum machine i hearmomentary lapse hasnt aged very well and like the following division bell it was a very bad idea thankfully pink floyds 70s output was so good that this will never tarnish their deserved reputation as rock legends but that doesnt keep it from being arguably pfs worst|0
i disagree with the above reviewdont waste your hard earned cash on this as its tigertailz at their very worsti was so excited when it came out but alas the excitment turned to disapointment when i finally heard itif ya want decent tailz stuff get bezerk or young and crazy|0
alright sammy the red rocker is backkind of a super group from the 70s and 80s good music for good times|1
this album was long awaited not actually too long and it is really good i cannot say wow but the job done really on high professional level the level which makes chickenfoot supergroup all parts of music performance fits perfect together i am so glad that guys play together and that i am able to order this kind of music from amazonpackaging is fun as previous album it is creative interactive and personal great job|1
i cannot listen to this album in bits for me the album has no meaning unless you listen to the harrowing semibiographical rock epic from start to finish disc one to disc twothis album has ingrained itself in me the story wraps itself around me and by the time outside the wall comes on i am quite drained it is a very strenous album i will not say anything about how good and bad some songs are because that does not do roger waters justice please look at the album as a whole and be amazed by easily one of the greatest rock albums of all timeby the way to hear a sound bit of roger waters screaming and spitting at a fan in montrealforcing him to be disgusted by his actions and write the wall|1
these cds are great as your kids listen you find you are singing too i bought them for my great great nephew he loves them|1
please  give the price of the cd how can i pay for it when itll camethanks  heacutercules|0
can pink floyd be without roger waters and still make aweinspiring albums  apparently not  im a huge pink floyd fan but this is the lamest excuse for a progressive rock album since yes in the middle 70s  the lyrics are inane the songs drag and david gilmours voice gets on my nerves after 15 minutes into the album  the final cut is not inspired either but this one has even less to offer|0
gregorian is just awesome  combines ancient gregorian chant with modern songs and this set contains their first 4 cds with an awesome book with some beutiful pictures  cant even buy the cds alone for this price|1
whether you call it hair metal glam metal or by some other name the hollywood rock sound in the 1980s was the decades most vibrant and exciting musical scene motley crue great white poison guns n roses and la guns were just a few of the bands from this scene to dominate the charts and their history and that of dozens of lesserknown acts are documented visually in hollywood rocksthe book is a wonderfully compiled visual history of the bands that put the sunset strip hard rock sound on the map there are tons of publicity photos flyers ticket stubs and other great images on just about every band to play the strip i thought i had a pretty good handle on that scenes bands but there are so many bands in this book that i had never even heard of its really a treasure trove of hair metal historyhollywood rocks is a nearperfect visual history of the hair metal era and one that belongs on the bookshelf or coffee table of any diehard fan of that kind of music between this book and thehollywood rocks audio companionbox set youll be reliving the 80s glory days in no time|1
another mainstream dj mix catering to the tastes of the party rather than providing its own flavor if you enjoy other talentless djs like bad boy bill or richard humpty vission youre sure to love this if you appreciate  more involved and affective tunes from real djs like cajmere we still  love you green  roy davis jr or paul johnson then skip this and every  other webster hall dancefloor hitif i could have given it  no stars i would have|0
my wife and i had the opportunity to see brian regan live and it was just an amazing show  the audience was on its feet the moment he came on stage standing ovation  and he delivered for it  we bought the cd immediately afterwards  some comedians hit a good joke here and there then pass the time with unfunny filler  not brian  this man hits it every time  its impossible for him not to be hilarious  regans show moves if that makes any sense  the pace is right  he doesnt limit himself to just a handful of subjects hes all over the board  its his style its perfect  buy the cd  go see him live  be a fanhes got a dvd coming out soon  i check his website  every day|1
the fact that rush can produce vapor trails snakes and arrows and now clockwork angels thirty plus years into their career is outrageous production problems aside vp was outstanding sa even better and now the latest clockwork angels a masterpiece the opening salvo of caravan and bu2b even though they were released earlier for the time machine tour are stronger versions here the title song is my favorite so far headlong flight and seven cities of gold are epic rush the wreckers has a chorus that will stay in your head all day fm radio will crave it wish them well is a positive uplifting precursor to the finalethe most unexpected rush song perhaps ever the garden this album being a concept of a lifelong journey ending it with bombast would not have fit it should end with reflection peace perhaps solace in your place of comfortyour garden i hope they play the album in its entirety for the upcoming tour clockwork angels deserves to be heard as youll hear it herepsas for those ridiculous calls for rush in the rrhof who cares i think the band actually wears the snub like a badge of honor anywayand who gets into rock and roll to be in any hall of fame|1
dear potential buyers of this recording jussi bjoerling operatic duets with robert merrill  either the list of musical numbers is not fully visible or this is a ridiculous false reproduction of a pretty great album the song list has been rearranged and the musical selections incomplete from the original recording i have one of the original vinyl albums issued in 1964 by rca and what you are seeing now isnt correct the songs were rearranged in order and one operatic scene completely ommited  the most notable omission being  verdis rigoletto act iii scene bella figlia dell amore one of the most incredible recordings of bjoerling robert merrill and roberta peters and anna maria rota  it is a shame if the original recording has been replaced with this current cd  it does a disservice to the artists and fans of these wonderful voices|0
the band was in shambles after test for echo due to neils losses their followup vapor trails showed a band struggling to remain a band vapor trails was a tremendous letdown for a lot of fans myself included not to mention holding the award for probably one of the worst sounding albums ever released by a major label but it contains a lot of passion snakes and arrows has some great moments and a few decent tracks overall but it falls flat as whole with clockwork angels we see rush back in full swing they want it again and theyre pushing themselves to be as good as they know they can solid playing at a very high level complex and intricate arrangements that keep your attention and a passion that shows they really want to make something greatwe thank you cant wait to see it live|1
the wall inspired by the experiences of roger waters is truly a dark masterpiece of rock musicthis albums storyline about a troubled rock star whos scarred psyche finally gets the best of him the death of his  father overbearing mother opressive schoolteachers fractured marriage  alienation from his music and his fans combined with drug usage leads him  into a dark journey through his isolation and the numerous demons that  continue to haunt himthe wall is truly a musical masterpiece filled  with explosive and subtle songs that tell the story of pink  floyd and his descent into a madness that only he can climb out from  roger waters who developed the story which stemmed from his alienated  experience of floyds overwhelming stadium tour of 1977waters with  david gilmour and producer bob ezrin create a unforgettable musical journey  that is searingly dark yet filled with universal human emotions another  brick in the wall pt 2 mother goodbye blue sky young lust hey you  comfortably numb run like hell and the trial are the standout songs that  make up the ambitious storythe accompanying film does a excellenct job  in capturing the nightmarish journey that pink floyd puts  himself through however bleak and depressing the story may be there is  powerful message of fighting through ones pain and not giving in to the  demons that will lead one on to better days ahead|1
my friend melissa got me into flyleaf just recently man have i been missing outi absolutly love all around me and sorrow but the rest of the cd is worth a listen too i also like there for you and fully alive very powerful songs with lyrics that arent just any old lyrics you actually feel the emotions in these songs plus there are acoustic versions a definete mustthe dvd includes footage of the performances as well as the videos for im so sickfully alive and all around me the videos are awesome you like flyleaf get this|1
this cd produced and arranged by mike spalla features real kittens singing 20 holiday classics  that is to say the lyrics of christmas songs are meowed by cats  its fake though  cats meows were recorded with a sampler and played back on a keyboard  there are also a few dog barks thrown in here and there  all the songs are old public domain songs so mike spalla doesnt have to pay royalties to the songwriters  it is somewhat amusing for one or two songs but it gets pretty tedious after 50 minutes  angels we have heard on high is the most amusing song here in my opinion|0
after loads of scathing remarks that followed my first review i decided to take that one down listen to the album for a couple weeks straight and come back with something that was hopefully more balanced  here it isyou would think rush would be the natural candidate for creating a concept album right  i mean they had 2112 and hemispheres that were almost there  the concepts on each of those albums were vivid the lyrics pointed and musical and the playing was out of this world  take the first side of hemispheres for instance  that is how you do a concept album  the entire thing tells a story from start to finish  there are themes variations on themes returns to those themes memorable lyrics and melodies signature guitar riffs solos that add to the song and are memorable rhythm grooves and well placed drum fills  you dont need to refer to liner notes or worse a novelization to grasp the story  on clockwork angels you have almost none of these elements  each song is an island and yet they are supposed to be part of a bigger story  they just dont tie together to paint a musical picture of this steampunk universe that peart has createdthe lyrics might be okay as prose but for song  on some songs it would seem that geddy was handed a lyric sheet right before he went into the vocal booth and told to just wing it with the melodybecause many times there just isnt one  one also gets the sense that a lot of the songs are in the same key  either because it was done purposely to give a sense of the mood of the characters in the story because they ran out of ideas because alex loves playing open strings or because geddys vocal range is shot  might be a little of eachdrum work was directed by the producer by waving a drum stick like a baton to conduct peart through the parts  peart actually praised this method of drum composition on the fly because it freed him from repetition ahemgrooves and having to think about the parts  this just tells me that peart is bored with playing drums altogether  hes obviously one of the best players on the planet and hes run out of influences  so he lets himself become a marionette of some young producer who obviously really digs tribal rhythms on the toms  on the rare song on the record that has some kind of extended groove it soon breaks down into yet another tribal rhythm  neil or nick obviously love that  compare and contrast the drum work on ca to that of hemispheres  random tribal nonsense with an occasional groove or tight grooves with amazing wellplaced fillsthe guitar work which i was very much looking forward to hearing is just okay  well played for sure and good tone but hardly a memorable riff to be found  the closest we get to rifforiented guitar rock is seven cities of gold and even then its not some inspired riffing  it is forgettable  the solos  too few too far between and too forgettable  they dont serve the song arent melodic you cant sing them in your head  alex has cut some very memorable solos in this time  even the nonmelodic ones are still quite memorable  nothing on this record thoughit was suggested by many that i go back and listen to the album over and over and that eventually id come to appreciate it  i even set aside time to listen to it with headphones and no distractions  dedicated listening time on good equipment  does listening over and over until i like it just mean that im such a big fan that i am forcing myself to like the record  yep probably  would i have done this for any other band  nope  repeated listening only served to strengthen my original opinions  this is a highly forgettable album from rush and it pains me to say that  i really like terry brown era rush up to and including most of signals  but i also do like their stuff from the mid 80s the 90s return to roots and even the stuff from the 2000s  but this nick raskulinecz guyhe has got to go  hes an admitted fan and far too attached to the band to say no to them  thats not what they need in a producer  they need terry brown or someone like himthe composition mixing and mastering i lay at the feet of nick  he owns that disaster  there is no light and dark save on the garden no open spaces  it is a constant heavily compressed overly loudness mastered sonic assault on the eardrums that leaves one fatigued after a short time of listening  he really needed to arrange these songs to let them breath  silence is golden in the right places  nick is of the school of modern rock and metal though and he obviously enjoys overly compressed loud musicbottom line  forgettable  like two songs better than the others bu2b and seven cities of gold  the rest i wouldnt care if i ever heard them again|0
the cd stopped playing the first time i played it i threw away the shipping papers and could not send it back i will know better next time to save the shipping papers before playing the cd the fist time my fault for thinking the new cd would play the first time that i try to use it|0

i love ron wagner but not this album  he added discoahem i mean club beatsto the music on this cd  totally took away from his talent and it sounds just like all the other trendy stuff that is out there  go back to what you use to do|0
let me first say that i love pink floyd but i have tried and tried and tried to listen to this album and i can never make it all the way through every song sounds like sorry half baked discards off of the wall there is no cohesive melody in any of the songs final cut just meanders along in drowning waters at this point it almost sounds like floyd parodying themselves with floydian gimmicks and lyrics there is very little of the usual musical inventiveness going on here this album is in pure cookie cutter mode|0
rushs new album clockwork angels isnt heaven sent its a foul piece of baboon rectum from the fiery pits of hell  i dont know where to begin but ill first critique the performances of the three monkeys on this drivel  first up is neil peart the old fart needs to give up playing the drums and spend his remaining days riding his motorcycle and write a coffee table book chronicling his travels across the wasteland know as canada  his timing is slightly off on the track caravan which could be due to old age  he simply doesnt havent anymore and if you listen closely youll notice how sloppy his drumming has become i sometimes wonder if his afrocentric hat distracts his playing  whether in the studio or on stage i cant help but wonder if he thinks about that colorful contraption that sits atop of his dome  either way neil peart has lost a step and people need to accept it  it just happens when you become a geezernext up is geddy lee usually your voice will deepen when you grow older but not mr lee  no way  geddy sounds like his bits got caught in his zipper which has resulted in his voice going up an octave  for a man approaching 60 he sure does sound like justin beiber singing baby baby  just listen to the track headlong flight and youll notice how awful mr lees vocals have become  the man who sang on classic tracks such as tom sawyer and limelight is a shell of his former self and his bass playing has started to suffer as well  heres some advice for geddy playing the bass might be easier if you remove two of the strings another complaint that i have is the lack of keyboards on this album  mr lee is the elton john of the progressive rock scene and he really needs to treat the world to his fantastic keyboard skillsthe third member is alex lifeson  i dont know where to begin  first his guitar playing isnt clean at all  bu2b2 is chock full of sloppy guitar playing that it makes kurt cobain sound like a virtuoso  as of right now because of lifesons regrettable performance on this album i have more respect for cobain as a guitarist  at least cobain didnt try to portray himself as a guitar god who thinks hes a stand up comedian  at this point in his life and after hearing some of the disastrous string picking maybe alex needs to find a new day job and hit the nightclub circuit and make people laugh because hes so hilarious  really if you watch his interviews hell make you tinkle a little bit in your pantsone word can sum up the songwriting on this album pretentious  its as if they are screaming for attentionhey look at us were progressive  were feeling the 70s vibe again but were going to make it modern  woohoo checkout the complex arrangements of our songs  were so cool because we try to write complex stuff  hey at least the production is better than vapor trails|0
sorry but a singer generally makes a group and this guy sounds the same on every song making all the songs sound the same  i wish slash could team up with ozzy  that could be interesting ill pass on this mess|0
i debated between 3 and 4 stars and ended up giving it 4 because i think myles kennedy and slash are two great musicians i think this is a good cd but imo not as good as the first i think i had my hopes set way too high and i was slightly disappointed myles can sing the phone book and i would listen the guy is brilliant and slash is amazing as well i like the fact that myles did all the vocals on this album vs the many singers on the first cd but the songs overall on the first album just grabbed my attention better it could be just me you know some albums just draw you in and some dont you cant really help it after listening to the entire cd 34 times i was just left with a feeling that the cd was rushed andor written quickly just to get something out there that was my impression and i cant really explain it any better than that they are great however and if you ever have a chance to see them live dont pass it up they will blow you away|1
i bought this terrific cd at the civil war museum in bardstown kentucky this is an excellent museum adjacent to a pioneer village a museum of natural history an american war history museum and the museum of women in the civil war the cd was only 20 plus tax so i feel like i got a bargain i already own several civil war music cds but this one is unique in that i appreciate the historical narrations among my cd treasures is the music cd of the ken burns civil war miniseries|1
dont be fooled by the star ratingthis cd is completely way out of the  supposedly true instrumental contextyeah i can still recommend it but  play it with volume control level 1hear it before you buy it|0
a christmas gift for my grandchildren i hope they liked it it had some really cute songs to sing along with|1
i agree the selections are iffy and there are better versions but my main complaint is much like the old where is the beef adjust where is the organminimal is the answer i bght this to hear mostly heavy duty organ this did not even begin to satisfy that yen|0
how this ever got commited to vinyl is beyond me it sounds like a bunch or drunken andor stoned morons who can barely carry a tune having a great time butchering the beatles greatest album incredibly bad left me dumbfounded and nauseated|0
now onto the albumi gotta say this is one of the best albums i have heard in my life pink floyd has moved from a band i didnt know to one of my top 5 favorite groups just from listening to this album i have viewed the movie right after i listened to this and the album makes much more sense from watching that i recommend picking that up right with this what i love about this album is that every song is linked kind of like combined into one big song that gos on for 80 minutes and if they can make a great movie with all the wall songs on it and have so much success with the movie it has to be great right i usually like cds with awesome guitar solos and drum solos and all that but this one had hardly any and i think i enjoyed it even more without solos the vocals are the main thing that brings the 26 songs togetherroger waters is great singing and really can show us what hes feeling in each song the vocals are sad depressing sometimes funny and also interesting how are they interesting because i have never heard what i did on this cd its so well put together the lyrics actually make up a plot and that made the cd great david gilmour actually does have some guitar solos but not as many as in the other cds the best song he is featured on with guitar solo is comfortably numb which is one of my favorite pink floyd songs i found the drumming to be great in this cd it was deep and i really loved it in hey yousong ratingsdisc 11 in the flesh31910102 the thin ice22910103 another brick in the wall pt130910104 the happiest days of our lives15110105 another brick in the wall pt235910106 mother53610107 goodbye blue sky24810108 empty spaces20810109 young lust330101010 one of my turns337101011 dont leave me now417101012 another brick in the wall pt3114101013 goodbye cruel world1171010disc 21 hey you44210102 is there anybody out there24010103 nobody home32410104 vera13310105 bring the boys back home12710106 comfortably numb62410107 the show must go on13510108 in the flesh41710109 run like hell424101010 waiting for the worms358101011 stop30101012 the trial520101013 outside the wall1441010all 1010 for this cd the best cd i listened to a must for any rock fan|1
treat her right was one of those bands that should have been heard live  they brought a twist to the chicago blues sound  a bostonized blues that hits the mark  their two studio recordings did not capture the essence of their sound  raw gutteral bluesy live  whats good for you fixes what a studio tends destroy for earlier thr records  a live studio albumthe album was recorded by the band in a single session  using the approach that so many great chess blues albums were recorded  this approach makes the album feel more like a set than an album  finding a groove that is carried from the first cut  the classic buck owens tune rhythm and booze   all the way through to the last track come back  the album is mostly covers of songs by the stones dylan johnny lee hooker and willie dixon  all to great effectthe disc is well worth the investment but  dont forget to grab a beer or two for the full effect|1
rush has deliveredi am trying to find the right combination of words to describe this album but it is difficultfirst and foremost it is a bloody beautiful albumthe music the lyrics the arrangements everything flows so perfectly smoothlyit is beautifulthere is a huge amount of maturity yet it is also very powerful and fresh at the same timethe music is so enthusiastic it is impossible to believe that it is the 38th year these guys are making musici am listening to the album while writing this review and i am smilingneil geddy alex i salute yourush is certainly not losing it|1
let it be at one time was greatbut grow up people it is 2005 this album is a relic not a classic|0
i love the cd it was great quality and i enjoy listening to the music its well worth buying if you like slash and myles kennedy|1
this is so satisfying and the songs have substance i was hooked on the rush sound since high school and these hard working guys are masters of the art not one bad track on this cd|1
like most american composers howard hanson is a little on the bland side  his 2nd symphony has some admirers although im not sure why  at least the cd isnt expensive so you can be bored cheaply|0
some of my alltime favorite guitar solos comfortably numb another brick ii and mother are to be found here as well as one of my favorite songs the aforementioned comfortably numb but the percentage of good listenable music on this large collection is quite low in my opinion in other words this isnt an album that you can put on and listen to all the way through if youre in the mood for pure music whereas previous albums would feature long somewhat ethereal musical interludes between and within songs here we have a few good songs tied together by relatively short strange snippets of lyrics masquerading as songs mostly sung by roger waters who is simply not in the same league as david gilmour as a vocalist in fact all the best songs here are predominantly sung by gilmourthe story being told here is ok but dark side of the moon wish you were here and animals all accomplished similar goals with much more subletly and far fewer words the music did most of the talking and thats what made them great albumsany fan of pink floyd should have this album in their collection there are some classic songs here but it is certainly not one of their best works taken as a whole|1
when i got this cd i thought it was the music from the first version and that is the main reason i bought it its an ok cd just not my taste in music|0
the sound is just terrible if you want a good bob marley concert get the japan one|0
like many we still have our vinyl stashed or stored away whatever happen to the days when it was front and center in our dwellings if youre like me i guess im keeping them just to retain a bit of my youth i have a vinyl copy of this album with the original plastic which i purchased at a discount store in the early 1970s for the sum of 199 it along with all my other beatle albums make for a nice display in the guest room of our home as well as an interesting conversation piecei really enjoyed hearing some for the more obscure beatle songs recorded on the pleaseplease me album hearing the fab four performing and recording material not written by lennon  mccartney takes these songs and transform them into the beatlesque style that the group was so famous for it also demostrates that good pop songs need not be over 3 minutes longif you enjoy the beatles music i recommed purchasing this album it really shows their musical tallent and professional approach to pop music besides i dont even own a turtable anymore so how am i going to make use of my 199 bargin|0
clint and martina are wonderfully talented singers their voices go together well but the problem as with many other duets is the song itself ordinary clicheacuted lyrics and melody quite radiofriendly and hooky but unmemorable|0
clearly the onestar rating im assigning this product is not for the musical content which is superb nor for its documentationtexts  i bought a new copy of this release from the metronome label through amazon marketplace seller avatar and the sealed copy was a burntoorder cdr not a redbookstandard compact disc  cdrs are not the same as cds and often they are not as durable the quality of the product is not necessarily the same the standards and means of production are not the same  customers should know what they are buying and in this case avatar the amazon product page and the actual jewelcase in which the disc camenone of these sources was forthcoming diligent honest about the nature of the disc containedi should also mention that ive had several problems with a few independent labels that practice this dishonesty nimbuswyastone danacord and now apparently metronome  new albion does this as well but i notice that at least amazon itself states that the disc is a cdr on the product page this at least is a reasonable caveatsell us cdrs if youd like but let us know what were getting instead of passively lying to us  its dishonest|0
i liked the soundtrack in the moviea loti thought the sacd would be a complete remix of the original soundtrack mastersi was ready for the stunning quality that some of the early classical recordings have been transformed into for example the george szell sacd recordings available here at amazoni was vastly wrongthe sound quality reminds me of early 45s if anybody remembers just without clicksa real waste of an sacd or even a cdi still like the music enough to not throw it away ill just never select it as an example of the sacd technology art|0
so emboldened by the diamond in the rough that was hellraiser 5 inferno i sat down to watch hellraiser 3 hell on earth with high hopes and rampant optimism well this was more like a turd splattered on a smooth lightly colored surface not completely without some amusement value but overall just general crap it was directed by the always game anthony hickock so it wasnt a complete waste ashley laurence shows up for a literal minute there is some good gore divine thing by the soup dragons is playing in one scene thats it but mostly it was pinhead was comically and ultimately rendered benign by thistalkative the lead performers were plucky but still unconvincing and people get turned into cenobites left and right ridiculous stupid comical silly awful inane asinine cenobites one had a video camera in his head that shoots lasers stupid another ejects razor keen cds out of various slots on his face also stupid the others are even worsefinally this 1992 flick features way too many optical effects some like the floating chains with blood thirsty hooks on the ends that crackled with blue electricity were pretty cool others all the others suckedi dont really care that the heart of darkness that characterizes hellraiser 1 2 and even 5 is totally absent here and the cenobites are reduced to lumbering jokes rather than the darkest inner demons of the most depraved minds and flesh that they otherwise are im flexible and have no fixed notions about what anything needs to be like i really wanted to like this movie and i was vibing with it for the first half an hour but it falls apart really fast and really bad blah|0
this is the beatles most overrated album i never understood why its often praised so often i mean sone songs on side 1 are meaningless and silly the second side definitly saved this album from total catostrophyi dont recommend this albumlisten to it before you buy and judge yourself|0
for anyone who has grown up listening to all the different guys in chickenfoot at one time or another for those who dont know thats sammy hagar joe satriani michael anthony and chad smith its very difficult to not like what they put out since you basically know what youre getting but this album is one of the best of the year so far imo big foot is a great first single from it and songs like alright alright and three and a half letters are just killer tracks as well that should be released imo check out chickenfoot if you havent already folks this is great stuff here and shouldnt be missed by anyone who is into classic hard rock|1
this is another great album in a string of consistent efforts its been a lot of years since i wondered if rush was still good at this pace it sounds like they could go for another 20 years|1
i found this cd really annoying it actually keeps me awake when its supposed to help me sleep the track all sound the same cheesy|0
yeah if there happens to be one other person besides my friends and the other guy who wrote a review on barry g who knows who he is i would be very surprised  this is quite possibly the worst cd ever made i hate to admit that i do still own it  but i only bust it out on special ocassions like when im depressed and want to laugh or when i want to make other people laugh  i bought the cd at a youth camp that he was performing at  i met barry and he signed my cd cover and everything  i cant believe that me and my friends used to think he was good  anyways barry g if youre out there reading this by some huge chance no offense bro i got nothing but love for you baby|0
great cd i play it when i am practicing reiki or pranic healing on a clientmy clients have also commented on how relaxing and soothing the music is its a must have for anyone doing healing work|1
i had this on 8 track when i was in the sixth grade  the vinyl is awesome with great space  it sounds like the helicopter is landing on your head|1
this is one of the best cds ive ever bought  it hooks you the first time you listen to it the result of the great guitar riffs vocals and occasionally beautiful melodies  after that you begin to hear the creative side of the band  every time i listen to this cd i hear something new hidden in a different songtime signature changes a dissonant chord here or there a series of guitars hitting on the upbeat when theyve been hitting on the downbeat throughout the song a new meaningful lyric uncoveredthis cd never gets old  listen to a sample of im so sick before you buy  if it doesnt smack you in the mouth too hard youll love this cd no matter what you normally listen to|1
this soundtrack is no goodcelines song my heart will go on  was overplayed on mtvvh1and radioits went on and on and very shuted  upthe other songs are just orchesta junkdont invest your money it this  cdits no good|0
i like his comedy because its not degrading to anyone except himself he is hilarious i love the peanut butter bit and laugh so hard at the spider web onehe is awesome and everyone i know who listens to the cd loves it and laughs|1
this is not the cd that i wanted  i cannot rate it fairly because of the fact that i made the mistake of ordering the incorrect cd  some may enjoy it but it is not my type of christmas music|0
no the wall is not some putasmileonyourfacemakeyoufeelallwarmandfuzzyinside kind of an album  if you solely listen to music to feel good or if you are of the opinion that all things artistic must have a happy ending then this work of pink floyd is not for youhowever if you have a real appreciation for reality  life is not fair the good guys dont always win and happiness is only one of the many emotions that humans experience  then you will appreciate roger waters exploration and expression of the more somber human emotionsartistically the wall ranks solidly with other pink floyd works such as dark side of the moon and wish you were here  the operatic style of the album is fitting for both the lyrical content and the many musical layers and transitions  while the wall is often referred to as a rock opera it is very different from other socalled rock operas such as the whos tommy  it is probably more precise to refer to the wall as a rock requiem rather than simply as a rock operaif you like the music of pink floyd and dont feel as if you have to listen to the likes of tony robbins 24x7 in order to keep from going off the deep end then you will love the artistic genius that is the wall|1
i am not a big fan of traditional country music so this isnt among my favorite garth cds however it is a very good debut album overall includes the only song garth ever wrote alone not counting you also includes the classics if tomorrow never comes the dance and much too young to feel this damn old very good|0
we came in are the first words you hear on the epic double album theyre spoken over some quiet music that suddenly turns into the first loud chords of in the flesh that introduces to pink floyd both the band and the fictional rock star that goes insane over the course of the record building an imaginary wall that shuts him off from the rest of the world the relaxed rocker is one of the real songs found on the album not just short snippets of filler used to illustrate the point of the story as the chords of flesh fade away in comes the short piano ballad the thin ice which flows into the clasic another brick in the wall part one the radio one is part two after a bizarre guitar solo these three tracks represent the wall no pauses in between songs and blending loud rock with soft ballads seemlessly rather than describe all 26 songs ill just mention some of the highlights of the real songs all another brick in the wall parts  mother a woonded accoustic goodbye blue sky a dark ballad with a cheery melody for the title line young lust a rocker hey you a slow accoustic song comfortably numb an amazing ballad in the flesh run like hell a song youll swear youve heard before with its jangly guitars and rock beat and the trial a crepy song where pink prosocutes himself within his distured mind while chanting eerily crazy i am crazy another thing about this album is it seems like one well two long songs proof of that is a guitar riff that constantly appears out of nowhere especially on disc two buy this album ignore the high price and enjoy|1
i have been a fan of alan munde since his days with the progressive bluegrass band country gazettein fact munde was the bands only constant during its nearly 20year history in the early eighties he released a series of instrumental albums entitled festival favorites on the ridge runner label now anthologized on rounder this is a broad look at the talents of one of the bluegrass worlds top banjo pickers among other musicians munde is joined by country gazette alumni joe carr guitar and roland white mandolin on many of these tracks running time  5146 very highly recommended|1
my sister got this back in 1980 and i played it more than she did  it was the last time the vintage pink floyd were all together  rick wright was fired during the final cut and roger waters himself split on a momentary lapse of reason  in addition this is one of the last big time concept albums pete townshend would write more concept albums as would roger watersyou have to hear it all to fully appreciate it  the story is a little obscure to many and it was to me until reading interviews and commentaries about this album  our hero pink uses bricks to build a wall to shelter himself from the many mishaps in his life another brick in the wall part 1 his father leaves while serving in war based on roger waters real father who was killed in wwii the happiest daysanother brick part 2 mistreatment in school and rebellion to follow mother deals with his overprotective mother pink grows up in young lust faces unrequited love dont leave me nowanother brick part 3 shuts himself off from society goodbye cruel worldhey youanybody out there and finally faces his personal demons stopthe trial  theres more to the story than that and this is just my own interpretation  youll have to listen for yourselfroger waters outdid himself with this story and he had some help from wright nick mason and especially david gilmour who never got the respect he deserved from waters  also bob ezrins orchestrations are great  other guests include the islington school whose payback was free time in the studio and toni tenille yes from the captain and tenille what a fabulous room|1
i still cant believe people like diamond dean see his review are still trying to compare everything sammy does to van halen  this album rocks  chickenfoot has their own sound and that is what makes them great  there is a so much diversity on the album  no remakes of cover songs from other bandssomething vh was famous for this is true rock and roll not songs like jump or dance the night away  van halens first album was great  after that they sold out until sammy got there  if you want to listen to true rock and roll this is the album  thank you chickenfoot|1
was nice to get some great music for a toddler to hear that is not all about killings and murders|1
this is a good cd the music is well rocking if  u dont like it dont buy it then complain because u bought it u should know what u are gettin before u buy it read reviews listen to samples youtube investigate there should be no bad reviews if u bought it u wanted it its good by the way well worth buying|1
heywhomever is writing these kids reviews can go jump off a bridge stop spamming this review board with your stupid and completely pointless messages pink floyd have been and always will be the greatest rock band ever shine on guys|1
this is a decent album but by no means his best songs are slower than is to be expected if youve some of smittys later work includes the hit song friends which in my opinion is nothing special the best song is you need a savior id get this if youre an avid fan of smitty but if this is the first album of his that youre going to purchase dont get it try the big picture or ill lead you home his two best works i believe this is still pretty good though and has blatent christcentered themes|1
shipper sent the cd through mail and it was shatttered into pieces by the time i got it  not impressed with the service|0
i loved slashs 1st solo album but i was glad to see that myles kennedy sang lead for the entire album this time these guys have obviously grown together musically after a few years on the roadalmost every song on apocalyptic love grabs hold of you forcing you to stomp your rightfoot  nod your headbuy buy buy|1
listen folksthis is not pretty music  its not necessarily pleasant either but that doesnt stop me from listening to it the honesty that mr waters writes with is sometimes difficult to face and the music sometimes disturbing  yet i suppose this is what sets this album apart from most any other popular music yet produced  gone are the trippy dippy days of yesterdays pink floyd music only to replaced by the harshes realities of living in this world i guess this goes to show that we all face hardships in life whether its the man in the ghetto or the one on the stadium stage  yes it is a story a story of a man who almost completely forgot what it was to be a child  a man who became more and more a part of the world which he saw through and despised as a youth  one day looking in the mirror to discover that he himself was as guilty as those he derided  yet theres hope here within his mirror he sees the twisted image of himself and his world  how many never glimpse that truth at all  how many are willing to spill their insides so that others might be moved or learn from the experience  perhaps he is a bleeding heart and an artistthe world needs their voice peace|1
pink floyd is one of those groups that  actually no more words need to be said  nearly every song theyve ever done has proved classic  due to their great albums such as meddle animals dark side of the moon wish you were here momentary lapse of reason and the division bell its my stance that pink floyd will go down in history as possibly the best rock group that humanity ever formed  and in my opinion their best album is the wall  its the ultimate musical expression concerning the new world madness of the 20th and 21st centuries particularly the madness which one feels in a world where its seemingly only oneself seeing out through a pair of hoffman lens  are you wearing them too  men are acting like compliant service and rank shift and file dumbed down warswine nkvd and women are even a touch shadier activating some kind of bulimic phony insecure actress archetype listening to music suggestive of minnie mouse on speed  thing into oblivion  plus in case some of you havent noticed youve been wallmarted for real but i guess well just chalk it all up to a few more very real bricks in the psychoticallynonexistant wall ie that which actually does seperate and perpetually exists for as long as no one speaks on it  perturbed  its enough to make one mad i tell ya and i believe that roger waters best expressed that sentiment musically  so without any further ado ladies and gentlemen i present to you the wall|1
no really signals was about technology throughout and this one is about lifes journeys signals has always been my favorite album by cohesiveness alone but this one is now second i loved vapor trails for the first few years of it but i finally agreed that it had sound issues snakes and arrows i tried to like it and thought i really did but now clockwork angels has surpassed both by miles the sound is back and the songwriting and the essence of rush is back everything a rush album should be this one takes the cake they even surprised everybody with several great ballads honestly the only ones i skipnot because they are not good songs but because of the soundare caravan and bu2b too harsh sounding imo they corrected that with the balanced sound of clockwork angels the song and the rest of the songs flow perfectly after thatrush has done it right this time again|1
when i buy a movie soundtrack i am usually quite impressed with the ammount of songs that were in the movie but i never noticed  this is far from the case with the replacement killers soundtrack  it has none of the  songs from the movie at all only the background music  i know what you  are saying  it says replacement killers soundtrack on the cd but let me  tell you true believer that all it has is background music  now dont get  me wrong  if you like danny elfmanlike scores to movies this one has it  all  however  i was looking for the songs from the movie and this cd had  none  buyer be warned|0
well thank god for micheal anthony and sammy hager at least those two x van halen members are still making some decent sounding old school rock and roll with chad and joe in the mix as well its gotta kick ass right well im happy to say that it does for the most part you wont find any jaw dropping momemts here but you will find great old school rock tunes a pleasure to listen to and im glad mikey and sammy can still rock even at their age lol well done lads keep it up for as long as you can cause ill keep buying if youre not dying|1
sorry people either you are deaf in the audio range of human sniffles or it does not bother you but this is a noisy terrible annoying mood killing recording along with some obvious slips the cd starts with a strange hum like somehow a 60hz signal got in there then the entire disk 2 is full of nonstop sniffling the sniffling stands out there all by itself because there is nothing to mask it i do not know where the mics were placed but they seem to be right under his nose philips usually does a good job but this one is going back to the reject bin|0
thats how many stars i would give this cd if it were possible six  brian regan has taken the world by storm at least the world that knows about him  tell all of your friends to listen to this cd because it is the most hilarious comedy on the market  brian uses everyday things that most of us dont even think about to propagate the most gut busting laughter that there ever was  if you like good clean jokes and can appretiate some really goofy humor then by all means buy this cd  even after listening to it eleventy billion times i still laugh at ever spin of the shiny disc  so you too should join me and my comedic friend and turn your stereo into the jokester of the night sure to please everyone at the party take luck|1
i own everything by pink floyd so i am ultimately qualified to report that this album sucks harder than a starving calf with a stoppedup mamamusic by which to commit suicide i recently played it again after it had been gathering dust for at least 20 years in my collection and was amazed to find that i liked it even less now than i did upon its release day and that hardly seems possible prior to this monsterous turd about the only thing pink floyd had ever done that i found fairly unlistenable were some of the nonlive portions of ummagumma in comparison to the final cut that was grammyworthy toonage egadsps  dont kid yerselves if you are honest youll fess up that the wall was almost as cringe inducing as this its red headed stepchild roger should have been taken out back and flogged unmercifully for foisting these 2 bombs into the hallowed pink floyd discographyhey its not too late is it|0
this band  is not  the  rock city angels   i  bought this heep  of an album  under  the guise it  was  the long  lost rca  demos  from memphis  when  geffen sent  the angels  to record the first album well  it  has nothing  to do with rca  and  this album is  well  bad|0
i was sent the wrong cd  am still waiting for the corecct cd to be sent 4 weeks later|0
was better than expected  stuart duncan is an amazing musician  do not believe he could make a bad recording  i cannot wait to get more of his recordings|1
not since bill cosbys dentist routine on himself have i laughed so hard  ive been listening to this cd for years and ill easily go out on a limb and say that hes by far the funniest man working the comedy circuit todayone thing ive always admired about him is that he works clean  you might hear a dmn or hll every now and then but compared to most comics these days his act is pristine and works because hes inherently funny  i respect comedians who dont have to fall back on cursing for their acts  he has a unique knack for being able to blend his trademark brand of selfdeprecating observations with his hilarious outbursts and facial and vocal contortionsas a bit of an anecdotal tangent a few weeks ago i was at disneyland waiting to buy one of their gigantic flintstonesstyle turkey legs  as i was standing there a group of high school kids walked behind me and i heard them belting out the followinggerman jermaine  jermaine jackson  jackson five titoany brian regan fan knows that this is from this cd  i was actually pretty surprised to hear a group of young kids all ing it and the entire group was cracking up  i wanted to turn around and as they walked towards the dubious safety of big thunder mountain railroad yell at them take luckit was living proof that his comedy speaks to all agesanother thing that others have observed is that he never makes fun of his audience  he creates jokes that the entire audience can enjoy since theyre all in on the joke too  his stabs are never really about specific individuals and even if they are theyre just his observations  my bet is that anyone with the name aymie sees brians bit about names in a positive and funny way  same with those guys on the fishing show or anyone who gets stuck sitting in the cars back seat middle with their feet on the humpmy one criticism about brian regan is that there just isnt enough of his material available to buy  he has one 8yearold cd and up until december of 2004 that was all he had  the release of the dvd was a big deal to me since id recently seen him perform at the irvine improv where he totally killed the audience with some of his best bitsotherwise ive had to comb the internet for anything reganrelated and aside from a couple lettermanradio appearances and poorly recorded club acts there just isnt all that much out thereid recommend this to anyone who wants to have a great laugh  hes on target for the duration of the cd and your face will have a permanent smile on it for the entire hour youre listening to itand as others have observed youll listen to it again and again until you can e it at will |1
the selections in this classical sampler are a bit cliched item pachelbels canon rossinis william tell overture strausss emperor waltz if i were to give a cd sampler to entice anyone to classical music i definitely would not choose this poor uninspired collection any beginner would immediately come away thinking that the classics are is stale and boring mere accompaniment to bugs bunny cartoons the disc simply does not give an exciting impression id choose a collection that features exciting and shorter compositions perhaps a paganini caprice a chopin etude any mozart sonata or concerto a bach cello suiteanything that rocks furthermore this cd has only ten tracks tsk tsk classical musicwhether performance or compositionis too overwhelming a field of human activity and achievement to be triviliazed by such a tasteless sampler stay away|0
for me this set the standard for what every album release should be not only do we get a full length 5 star album but we get an incredible amount of bonus content as well this makes every other album ive bought this year look cheap and lack luster in juxtaposition a must buy|1
the first brahms piano concerto is one of my favourite pieces and having been without a recording of it for several years i selected this one based on all the rave reviews i read here on amazon however the recording disappointed me it lacks the clarity weve come to expect in the digital age and gilels disappointed me in the first movement this music is very demanding even for a topnotch pianist like gilels and i thought he fell short the fortissimo trills at the top of octavespanning chords demand tremendous strength and stamina in the weakest fingers of the hand and ive heard better for example from emanuel ax and from bruno leonardo gelber in general of course gilels was a better pianist than gelber but those trills need special qualities which gilels hadnt got judging by this recordingill discard these cds and keep looking|0
first the title of the cd is misleading since it is not komitas who sings but a student of his second the music may be celebrated by armenians but is in fact dull and lackluster a mixture of opera and folklore taking the worse sides of both arts the whole experience is not unpleasant but in the end i remained quite alienated from this type of music it rang no bells which was expected i bought the cd so as to hear something new but it did not make me more curious about armenian music either the quality of the first track is so poor that it should have been omitted even gthe greatest admirers of komitas will certainly skip the piece anytime they listen to the other ones|0
there seems to be an amazing amount of film soundrack  recordings done by second rate euro orchestras of late  none of which seem to match the original soundtrack versions this so called epic recording is a prime example quickly and cheaply recordedlacking understanding and soul of the originalsand more important because of time limitationsno rehearsal time with instruments being out of tune   this recording is another attempt to cash in on the nostalgia wave of collectors  it fails miserably  listen to the originals and match them to this out of tune out of phase recording and mourn the loss of any record company doing justice to the originals  this is a cheap cash in on the nostalgia craze and anyone who has a reverence to varese emi chandos southern cross or other labels that might still attempt to preserve original  film musics there are still severalshould try and revert to the originals  this is horrific stuff  order at will|0
i love this cd a lot of good songs on this disc and plays every time in my car i would buy more cds from slash|1
great stuff i got this album a week after i bought dark side of the moon i hated this at first because it was nothing like dark side i gave it a second chance then a third then a fourth now i love it especially best days of our livesanother brick in the wall part 2 and one of my turns if youre someone who only has dark side of the moon i suggest you try animals before this one|1
i ordered and received the glenn miller cd titled in the mood but it had different cover art and a different track list than described for this item  unfortunately it didnt have the song i wanted elmers tuneim going to try to add the front  back image of what i received to the images for this item|0
what a disappointment this album sounds like a bunch of bside cuts that didnt make it on the wall thankfully waters voice sounds tired and the instrumentals are not even close to previous floyd efforts right from the start this album sounds uninspired and even after giving it a chance as some other reviewer suggested and suffering by listening to this aweful lp my opinion didnt changeavoid this album and check out1 the wall  pink floyds best and a true masterpiece in every sense2 wish you were here  great very much like dsotm only better3 dark side of the moon  technically a masterpiece but the wall and wywh have more replay value|0
this is one of the worst environmental cds i have ever heard  the cover art promises the enjoyment of a silvery moon night in a forest  the sounds emitting from this cd are grating irritating and anything but relaxing  i felt like i was in an entire cave of crickets  my recommendation is to skip this one|0
the clarity of this cd is similiar to the hiss of a radio between channelsand you dont have to pay extra for that if youve been to the ocean youll realize that this is not what it sounds like |0
this album rocks simply put they are back on the map the more i listen to it the more i love it|1
when i had my five year old son listen to this cd he said mom is that an angel talking this is one of our favorite cds  we listen to it whenever we need to be rejuvenated and energized  the quality of denises voice with the beautiful soundsmusic in the background is a very meditative experience|1
what a disappointment this was the first simpson cd ive ever purchased and it is terrible i watch the simpsons all the time and i know there are many many great songs on the show but did they pick any of those great songs no it had way too much talking on it and a couple different simpson theme song paradies the songs were short i guess i was hoping they would elaborate on the songs a bit more there were only two songs on it that were fun to sing along with i based my cd choice on the reviews of this product and i dont know where those people were coming from but this cd is not the one with all the good songs on it so pick another one or build your own off itunes|0
i find this record disappointing and considering the final results not a little pretentious you get the usual spiritual name checking in the influences section the tibetan book of the dead the egyptian book of the dead african spirituality etc etc but there isnt much in the music to show where all those influences wentthere are memorable moments dont get me wrong and hence the 2 stars but there just arent enough of them to really make a differencemoods tend to clash against each other preventing the album from really setting an atmosphere or developing and the music goes from the rather beautiful healing song to the plodding pedestrian rb of children hold on the whole thing feels like a jumbled collection of individual pieces rather than a coherent albumget an alice coltrane record instead itll probably be everything this record tries and fails to be|0
when i first bought the wall and listened to the first few songs i was wondering what the big deal was  however the more i listened to songs like comfortably numbyoung lust nobody home and run like hell the more  i liked it  i didnt really get into some of roger waters  songscomfortably numb was a revamp of a david gilmour song which they then  colaborated on and young lust and run like hell were written by gilmour  dont let the sleeve fool you but i think that a lot of people have and  will love his work i love what he did on dark side of the moon and wish  you were here  david gilmours guitar solo on comfortably numb is  possibly his best ever definately his most dramatic and his work on other  songs that i mentioned is great too  so basically i didnt go for the  story but it is still one of my three favorite albums of all time|1
clockwork angelsim no master reviewer and certainly no critic but i have been a long time fan and ive been privately critical but always in an attempt to be constructive  there is a certain recklessness a hey weve been at this for a while and we can do what the hell we want  there is a mature curiosity mixed with a restlessness on this album that is so refreshingive noticed differences vocally and a meanness in the instruments that shows this restlessness yet a sensibility that is expressed in the melodies  keep it up rush  youre are one of the only bands this side of the atlantic that shows this drive and are certainly emulated on the other side of the atlantic for your tenacity|1
this album is a magnificent summation of the rush career so far you can hear splinters and snippets of the past but not in a cameo throwback kind of way but rather as well used tools in the rush toolbox and as this is rush there is huge amount of simply new territory here it hits hard at some places and at some points it feels like youre listening to a metal record then itll switch gears and you travel across jazz blues classical orchestras and even a bit of pop the title track is worthy of its place on the album it being a miniconcept in itselfthere are a few less than marvelous points but these points are still solid and would have been considered strong tracks on albums like snakes and arrowsoverall if youre a rush fan you need this it might be a little much to wade into from people who havent listened to rush however|1
ive been a pink floyd fan for a long time  i had the wall album on vinal back when we used this thing called a turn table  when i wanted to get the cd of the wall i knew the best place to start was amazoncom  for one thing its only half as much the cost as if it were bought in a store like best buy and the second is trying to find it in a store  most stores only stock an older groups greatest hits cds  the wall is one of my favroit pink floyd albums so far ive played parts of it every day since i received it|1

my 17 month old son and i love raffi songs  this collection of cds contains wonderful music for children and anyone who likes raffi  i bought the cds because of the brush your teeth song on the first cd in the set  i needed something to liven up teeth brushing sessions with my toddler  he liked that song as well as all the other songs in the collection  we love it|1
this is the greatest buy in this worldno album or musical entity comes even  close pink floyd rules and wall is the definition of pink floyd of roger waters days in pf a must must must must buy|1
on side 2 of the wall pink is now fully immersed in the wall he has constructed around himself he begins to call for help shouting hey you at everyone who passes by when no one responds he begins to wonder is  there anybody out there when he realizes that no one is there to help him  and when he comes to grips with his fathers death he becomes comfortably  numb in a world of heroin addiction hence the two swollen hand  references on side 2 once he is immersed in drugs and has lost all hope  he contemplates suicide but realizes that he cannot take the easy way out  and that the show must go on the new more fascist pink then emerges he  tells his audience that the old pink isnt well he stayed back at  the hotel this new pink is insistent that his fans be loyal to him  and carry out his desires as this is his only form of attention when his  fans refuse to carry out acts of bigotry for him he tells them theyd  better run like hell to escape his wrath he soon realizes that he is a  fake and begs everything and everyone to stop when his life comes into  full focus he must endure the trial to see if he is responsible for his  fate or if the fault lies with that likes of his schoolmaster his mother  or his wife he is found guilty and sentenced to be exposed before his  peers once he realizes that all if the people who have been torturing him  all his life were really trying to help him all along he manages to make  it outside the wall the wall is a brilliant album|1
in my opinion this was petras best album musically not lyrically but musically their albums from around this period went from a muffled guitar like on back to the streets and this means war to a crunchy in your face metal sound complete with some ripping guitars solos from the annointed psalmeister thats not a real word btw of godmr bob hartman if you like petra hard and raw with an 80s metal vibe then by all meansget this cd you wont be disappointed|1
ordered this one for my family to add something different to the holiday season this year  great album with a nice mix of chanukah music and historical information  if you are a fan of klezmer music and want to liven up your house during the holiday season i recommend downloading this album|1
heh least you can see em coming at rolling stone  and you can immediately dismiss anybody who characterizes iii as confusingly named  thems what dont get the joke likely wont get the album not to discount anyone who digs the party atmosphere or the slightly more varied nature of the hard rockers on the first album but by any measure of cohesion and commitment among the musicians this album simply blows the first out of the water  and for my money a whole lotta 2ndgen van halen tooheres the thing that struck me i started rattling my usual lyrical litany with hagar in spite of myself  about how he immediately squandered a great payoff line in different devil and capped it off with a toofacile lovers under covers rhyme and then heres this same old upinthemorninglateintheevening offthecuffscat on bigfoot alrightalrightalrightalrightalrightalright lasttemptationbh really andandholy crap thats just about it whoever said the lyrics dont get in the way this time was spoton and before anyone lamely attempts to seize this premise and shove it down some highfriction slope of listening for the lyrics just go pound it sideways alright all im asking for are verses that arent so frackin inept they derail my headbanginghagars as blunt a verbal instrument as ever but damned if that dont actually work most of the time for iii the whole notion of cheese is pretty elastic from one listener to the next as i define it it has to do with the eyerolling excess that often comes as a singer aims all trite and hackneyed for some high concept reaching sadly beyond his lyrical grasp  and if it all happens in a lush and sappy bed of keyboards so much the worsewhich is why im flying to a pretty emphatic defense of come closer ain no hallmarkcard mush or alientalk on this one its a very simple and naked display of soul vulnerability and longing right in line with motown soul classics right in ol reds verbal wheelhouse and so much more charismatic as a result now that we see hagar did the lyrics first and satriani composed such a clean and spare piece around it it comes a little clearer why hagars solo work is often a little less fragrant with the fromage  i have to wonder if that wasnt the key development here far as yr obt svt is concerned hagar and present company have finally hit the aesthetic target hes been aiming for all these years in a way he never could manage with all van halens why cant this be when its love comes walking in pap my hats off on this oneand yeah 3 letters works for me too its a tricky concept and were it done exactly the way hagar conceived it there might have been trouble  but satriani came up with just the bluesy sinew needed to hold that piece together from there my friend i guess it depends on how you personally are feeling the zeitgeist i got people close to me who are affected and need a damn job so im fine with the concept fine with smiths studioshattering cannonade and especially fine with the rage hagar bites down on his last wordwhile were all zeitgeisty no change is a nice little slice of atmospheric angst with a tasty little doomsday melody speaking of those more straightahead rockers yeah id say theres a little less variation among em because cf invested the experimentation where it really counted this time dont mean you dont find funk and dropkick beats and spookyfingertipinteraction and background vocals beaming like youve never heard em before last temptation has progressions right as rain dubai blues grooves like freuds worst nightmare and a riot to boot and heres a word to the wise about lighten up a bad day at the office 400 or more horsepower underfoot and this tune are an instant recipe for a second mortgage to your insurance carrierand then theres something going wrong which might just be the best of everything rolled into one the net effect of satrianis atmosphere hagars vocal and lyrical pensiveness smiths minimalism and anthonys top vocal support in forever render this track just exactly as satch and ol red characterize it spooky if this one catches you in just the right space the hairs of your nape will stand straight up  you can take that to the bankthats what we have here that wasnt quite cooked on the first album a clean balance between riffs visible from the surface of mars and honest emotional impact often in the same beatze top four pour moi ascending no change come closer lighten up and somethings going wrongand as we continue waiting for van godot ill still gladly take the rest thanks|1

before leaving floyd in 83 roger waters was able to create his masterpiece with the rest of the band  this semiautobiographical collection takes the listener on a journey through the life of the rocker  pink and in doing so also illustrates the life of our favorite song  writer mr waters himself  highlights include another brick in the wall  ii goodbye blue skies comfortably numb and hey you  this album was an  instant classic and certainly pleased the fans that may have thought that  the floyd could not have topped the dark side of the moon  cyharrhotmailcom|1
i got the flyleaf ep and after hearing that i wanted to get the cd the songs are changed a lot from ep but still good at first they sounded worse since they had lot of added effects or such to the song after getting use to them i ended up preferring the versions on this cd but still would recommend for people who liked this cd i would recommend even more if you sorta liked band to get ep since it has different sound the lyrics change a lot between some ep and normal versions off the songs mainly im so sick the acoustics also change lyrics a bit mainly cassie its a good cd with lot of nice sounds but many have a religious reference some very directly|1
if you are interested in mr oconnors normally fabulous music ie the 30 year retrospective album midnight on the water in full swing you will likely gag at this album dont get me wrong oconnor has no contemporary comparison when it comes to talent and catchy tunes  but this album is snlow and full of synthesizers and reverb like a weird technotrip back to the eighties  its the music you might hear in a soundtrack of a corny after school special  the good stuff is buried too deep to find here|0
ill take the broaway cast album every time julie andrews is simply unbeatable if only we werent stuck with rex harrison in both versions|0
1st time i listened to it i thought it was ok 2nd time ok not a barn burneri set it aside and kind of forgot about it i forced myself to listen to it 3 times in 2 days  after a friend ask me if i heard it and how i liked it  epic every song speaks to me  epic dont listen to the negative reviews buy this cd  great vocalsguitar bass  drums cool lyrics  10x better than rnfr  did i mention epic|1
promontory was cut short and is not as it was in the film  it was the climax of the entire film and this tune made it a complete package  very disappointing  this is the 3rd soundtrackscore that ive purchased in the hopes of having this tune as it was in the movie  it looks like my only option is to somehow have the music ripped from the dvd itself|0
one of the best rush albums since moving pictures and snake  arrows very rich and full sound with the string ensemble i loved it|1
i was looking for a good drummer so that i could buy cds for my grandson who is learning the drums and plays in his school band i found that the drumming is great on this album and i enjoyed the music as well im not normally into rock music but i do enjoy listening to this cd|1
i have seen this recording reviewed positively but i just dont get it  i own the 1990 pressing shown here and its possible that a remastering would help matters  the sound is rough and very present but there are times when it is less than pleasant to listen to  in the high loud passages especially  while the bass is clompingly heavy at the other end of the spectrum  the haydn variations recorded with a different team in a different venue same year 1967 sound a bit better  although szells 1964 variations and even more abbados 1990 recording of them are to be preferred even though abbados sound isnt quite up to the telarc 1990 standardthe concerto is the main work on the disc however and it seems leaden to me  the sound doesnt help but barbirolli is too slow for the maestoso opening or is it just a matter of sluggish lack of crispness on the accents and barenboim recorded up front tends to play too loudly  the upper register of the piano is edgy and clangy and the music proceeds without the readers ear picking up a developing shape  its as if each section is given its moment then on we go without much propulsion or purpose  serkin and szell recorded about the same time are in a different league both sonically and in terms of coherence and orchestrapiano interaction  ive never heard a less magical ending to the slow movement than we get on this disc  the final movement is rambunctious and noisy  maybe thats fine  but the sound is too heavy  i cant recommend this  its the more disappointing because i like barenboims recording of the cello sonatas with dupre and i admire barbirollis mahler and his nuits dete with baker which is magical|0
i have seen rush on nearly every tour since the signals tour and they have been my favorite band since moving pictures ruled aor radio  while most of their albums are still very listenable i just dont see much longevity coming from this album  snakes  arrows stands out as an opus in comparison  where are the melodies  where are any memorable hooks  memorable drum fills  riffs  crickets  also i do believe that neil has gotten his point across the antichristianity thing  we get it neil  if you dont like religion why the focus on angels in your lyricswhen i saw rush on the snakes  arrows tour twice i thought geddys voice had reached a certain level of sophistication like an aged burgundy that he so enjoys  the engineering and production on clockwork angels dont come close to doing it justice  listen to the drum fills on presto such as available light and then listen to this album and youll see exactly what im referring to on the productioni dont know if ultimately this is rushs doing or nick rs or a combination thereof but this combination just isnt working|0
cd by favorite artist good variety of songs and priced was reasonable  will watch for more cds from clay crosse|1
im one of the people out there that actually saw the wall concert in la i still to this day remember everything about it and will forever hold these memories sacred|1
i have been a huge rush fan since i first discovered them at around age eleven in the mid80s and clockwork angels is their best album in thirty years imo of course and the most consistently heavy of all their albums the hard rock edge however does not come at the price of a dazzling amount of intricacy and overall musicianship reminiscent of rush efforts of the early days apparently clockwork is supposed to be a concept album think the first half of 2112 even though i havent figured out exactly what the story is which would suit such a label maybe ive just spent too much time concentrating on the amazing instrumentation tempochanges and geddy lees energetic vocals powered as usual by neil pearts lyrics  a refreshing rarity in hard rock to worry about the collections overall coherence if youre a casual rush fan or one who like me loved their old stuff but gew tired of their releases over the last decade or two this is the album to get and if you love the albums of the last twenty years id be shocked if you didnt put this one right up there with  or even above  their more recent albums in short but it you will not be disappointed|1
flyleaf is so awesome i love this cd lacey is awesome i love the way she screams and sings i got to see them in concert and they were awesome i love all of the songs on here this is a great rock album|1
anything that was made after mark lindsay was no longer with the group is a joke  if it doesnt say featuring mark lindsay dont waste your money  mark left the group in the 70s and for good reason  even when the band first started he was getting half pay because he didnt play an instrument  can you believe that  he taught himself to play the sax  and beautifully i might add as showcased in melody for an unknown girl  he later learned guitar keyboards just about any instrument  indian reservation was supposed to be his first solo but being faithful to the group he did it with them and they called themselves the raiders  when he finally did go solo and did arizona and silver bird he walked in to get his royalty check and was told that the raiders account was in the red so all of that money went to them  that was the last straw  can you blame him  to this day mark gets about a millionth of a penny for any raiders music sold  that makes me so madif you want to enjoy the raiders old classics make sure you get the lps and 45s  or if you get a cd make sure it features mark  there are of course fantastic albums and cds from marks solo careerif you want to prove to yourself that true talent never fades get a copy of marks new cd 2013  he cowrote all of the music with gar francis and all 14 songs are amazing  mark is 71 years old and can still rock it out like he did at 19  he tours with shows like the happy together tour and his new cd is available here at amazon and from other sites  check him out on facebook he has two sites  the man is still singing his heart out and looks fantastic toothe raiders were  and still are  a highly underrated band because of the image that stuck with them after doing shows with dick clark and because of the fun costumes  if you listen to the music marks vocals in particular and consider that mark wrote most of the music after the group had only been together for several years you know who the star of raiders was and is  i cant believe that people go to see paul revere dick and a bunch of strangers doing marks music  its a joke  i got a clue as to how this could happen when i was reading a recent small on line article about pauls recent illness  someone commented that pauls real name was mark lindsay  unreal  how anybody could see this ridiculous group of men and not notice that mark is missing is beyond me  mark was the raiders there would have been no raiders without him  and he is still a star a phenomenal talent and a gentleman  buy marks music and like him at facebook|0
i will add my caveat emptor here along with the others  i bought this cd on the laserlight label my version has a purple featherypaper look cover and a snapshot image of a belly dancer in a red cabaret costume on the front  my cd says copyright 1993 on it and has a note all songs public domain  licensed from tradition records  the title is authentic belly dance music with the romslavicwhatever titles for the tracks however when i fed it into a query of the cddb database the tracks came up with their originallanguage titles taken from the lyrics of the songs  now the legacy cd titled belly dance music art of seduction 1997 has these track titles and appears to be a reissue of the same bootlegquality cd  if you want some nice gypsy music feel free to listen and enjoybut i will agree that the sound quality is poor  im accustomed to this since i listen to a lot of folkloric  ethnic recordings where the recording environment is not necessarily friendly to sound engineering so it really didnt bother me that much  i liked most of the songs and hey if youre into greek style belly dance or eastern european or macedonian folk dance why not  but it definitely isnt your usual belly dancing fare and students of egyptian belly dance would be better served by looking for hossam ramzy omar faruk tekbilek solace or maybe one of the cds produced by daniel der sahakian on the lebanese voice of stars label|0

i have purchasedand been dissapointed byseveral of chuck and suzannes cds this cd features poor sound quality and an almost total lack of animal soundit sounds like wind blowing over a microphone save your money  folks|0
i personnally do not like this recording very much i really think that things like the quite irritating glissandos listen to the first fragment of the cd and you will immediately notice them or at certain moments the lack of spirit dynamics and structural transparency espacially in some of the faster movements really cast a shadow over the beautifull moments that this recording holdsi ve also let some other people listen to this recording  without telling them by whom it was played among them where guitar players people that played other instruments and some that dont play an instrument at all they all agreed that this was not really a top preformance when i told them that it was played by john williams they all where shocked why were they shocked because williams is a great preformer and normally delivers very high quality material this is the only lesser williams recording i know of this could in my opinion unfortunatly also be one of the reasons why many praise itthe guitar recording of this music i personally like the most is the one by paul galbraith|0
i listened to this album fairly frequently and quite liked it when i was about 17 then lost it within a year i bought it again many years later listened to it once and have never played it since its awfulits frankly difficult to imagine a worse example of navelgazing erected into such a pompous selfimpressed musical monument nearly every song on this album expresses bland and unexplained angst as though it were an apocalypse one can see how it appeals to either adolescents or not very bright people who are selfpersuaded that they have problems of some profundity theres even a track entitled goodbye cruel world and a song beginning with the line i wanna go home leaving aside the triteness of the concept of an emotional wall built around the supposedly tortured individual consider how the idea itself is exploredwhen we grew up and went to schoolthere were certain teachers who wouldhurt the children in any way they couldfrom the happiest days of our livesis there anyone who hasnt had that experience its one thing to explore a shallow theme another entirely to do so in bad lyrics then the teenager goes home from school and enters an oedipal world wheremothers gonna make all your nightmares come truemothers gonna put all her fears into youmothers gonna keep you right here under her wingshe wont let you fly but she might let you singfrom motherlyrics that basically punch you in the face with their ideas are not really intended for thinking people a selfpitying thirteenyear old asked to write some doggrell about their own feelings of adolescent angst might for example have scribbled the following lines on the bus to schoolive got wild staring eyesand ive got a strong urge to flybut i got nowhere to fly tofrom nobody homefeeling sorry for yourself as george c scott once remarked is the most popular indoor sport it rarely makes for artistic greatness however and here the listener is being asked to choke on two whole jars of itsome of the songs are of such absurd brevity as to leave the listener with a cheated feeling others are inexplicably bookended by random fragments of dialogue or puzzling sound effects its a mess in short but so myopic and selfimpressed were the floyds that the album underwent the fate of being reworked into a bloviated motion picture and an even more pompous  concert in berlin all of this could have been avoided had the artists had any of the introspection that this album so plainly pretends to wear on its sleeve|0
you gotta love this guy these songs are the best sig along songs for kids my boy will love growing up singing these with mom and me mostly mom because she sings much prettier than i|1
this cd is fun and  happy it makes you want to dance and sing with your little kids  the kids love it and my daughter works with challenged children and they love this cd|1
the bird songs are acceptable however the cd is only a little more that half full  this is not like the birds are demanding  excessive amounts of bird seed in payment i can do much better by simply hanging a microphone in the woods recording in the morning and editing slightly how is that so difficult|0
every so often a brilliant record will be recorded usually a combination of a perfect environment and talented artists convergingthis pushes that beyond any feasible limitthe genius of this record will leave you speechlesspinks descent is even more brilliant than the other masterpiece that springs to mindnine inch nails downward spiralmulti layered and as in depth as could be physically possibleemotion technical perfectionim running out of things to compliment this record withits absolutely timeless and for anybody with a degree of intelligence enough to even begin to understand this piece of art it will grow more brilliant and perplexing throughout each listenso to say id recommend this to any true music loverand i mean music lover hell art lovernot just prog rockthis transcends geniussimply ungodly need i say more and just for the record for the pitiful imbecilic fools mr vicious trying to lower its star countii find it hard to voice the words of contempt and disgust i feel for youyou must be very sad inferior unintelligent inconsequential insects to even let the thought of insulting this album pass through your britney spears comatosed mindset regardless this album is the benchmark buy it personally guarantee you will not be let down|1
i bought this cd almost solely because of the last track its over which is excellent the first track main title is good memorable too otherwise theres nothing outstanding on this thats not to say the music doesnt work well for enhancing the mood of the terminator 2 movie but for standalone listening pleasure only the two aforementioned tracks are any goodsimply put what i got wasnt worth what i paid thus i would not recommend you spend your money on this unless you have a strong penchant for movie soundtracks|0
while the 2009 remasters are as close as we aged original beatle fans will get to our beloved vinyls i recall being disappointed with the muddiness of baby your a rich man on the magical mystery tour lp all you need is love only a northern song all too much and a few other lp tracks way back in the 60s while the 2009 remasters are great the muddiness evident in these select tracks has carried over to the 2009 remasters if you want to hear the lads singing in your living room instead of through a sock may i suggest you pick up songtrack instead of the remastered compilation offered here all six of the lads contributions appearing on this cd are remixed and enhanced with much greater clarity on the yellow submarine songtrack cd including many other remixed tracks from other albums whereby the vocal tracks have finally been properly centered eg nowhere man and think for yourself just listen to baby your a rich man and only a northern song on songtrack and i doubt youll ever go backcompare for yourself i know many pundits for authenticity dont like to mess with the original recordings but nothing is added or taken away from the lads performances in songtrack if anything you can hear them better as for george martins instrumentals theyre great in the context of the movie but since they are mostly reactive to whats going on on the screen and we cant see the screen on an audio cd it just doesnt stand alone as a listening experience here its like watching a road runner cartoon with a burned out projector lamp those opposed to remixing perhaps should take note the same engineers and project coordinator who gave us the 2009 remasters allan rouse paul hicks and steve rooke also gave us songtrack evidently they too knew what needed to be done|0
i watched mad max on saturday and i dont think i have seen it in since it was released this score was so out of place out of context and so 70s moviebadorchestraloverdone i think it might be the worstmatched movie score of all time|0
this band has hung around for 40 years made some great albums in the early 1980s continued from there with repetitive material but great concerts and now suddenly they are better massively better  not only does clockwork angels succinctly present a lifetime of lifes lessons in precise lyrics but these guys really really rock  rather than discuss each track which are all incongruent with top 40 tunes ill just say its their most cohesive album ever  no other band out today can but hide and listen in the force of this material  the last track garden is beyond thorough composition  it can only be compared to the great allegories of literature and classical music  a few great rock bands have survived but rush is the only one i know that still thrives|1
being a longtime fan of rush30 yearsi have followed them through all different phases and i believe this album will go down as one of their best a daring move since albums seem to be a thing of the past but it works the songs are strong on their own but form a cohesive hole that is more than the sum of its parts when all is said and done this should be mentioned in the same breath as 2112 and moving pictures|1
rush is amazing and should be in the rock and roll hall of fame periodthis album is great and everyone should buy it|1
one would think with the recent revival rush have received in terms of popularity and mainstream acceptance that they would be content to rest on their laurels and tour off their greatest hits for the rest of their lives one would be wrong over forty years into their storied career the three men that define rush  vocalistbassist geddy lee guitarist alex lifeson and drummerlyricistphilosopher neil peart  are still going strong sounding every bit as focused and inspired as they did in their halcyon daysrather than pay tribute to a bygone area clockwork angels rushs 20th  studio album take the road less traveled and breaks new ground for the group reconvening with producer nick raskulinecz who helmed 2007s snakes  arrows as well as other recent midcareer revivals from alice in chains and deftones the sound that defines rush on the album is big and bold there isnt a song here that doesnt hit hard whether its through the use of a pulsing bassline courtesy of lee caravan a sweeping orchestral arrangement the garden or an allout guitar solo from lifeson headlong flight rush do their best to create an album that is as dense and expansive as it is heavy and heavy it is clockwork angels is perhaps the heaviest rush album to date which will slap a grin on the face of anyone whos ever been a fan of the band just as heavy as the music are the lyrical passages by peart which ooze of his signature existentialism and enlightenment this combination makes clockwork angels an instant classic and one that will sound every bit as new and fresh to the average fan as it will sound like homethe fact that rush are still going strong and still pushing themselves this late in the game is a testament to their character and their evergrowing reputation as being one of the best bands not only in canada but in the entire world like most of their career clockwork angels transcends generations it is every bit as appealing to the average rush fan whether they be 15 or 50 so whether in mp3 form on compact disc or even vinyl if you are reading this you owe it to yourself to experience clockwork angels if this effort is any indication the band still has a bright and fruitful future ahead of them|1
i listened to this to help me with sleeping a solid eight hours but to me the rain on this cd sounds like static so it didnt really help me to get 8 hours of sleep  i figure i get 6 hours of sleep sometimes 5  the healthy amount of sleep a person should have is 8 hours so in 10 years ive lost 1 year of sleep  with my life the way it is i should be trying to sleep through as much of it as possible ha|0
brian is able to convey the poignancy of life and humor in a wonderful blend i think his jokes about childhood and school go deep into a lot of anxiety that most people had or have as kids such as science fair projects spelling contests and little league practice also for anyone trying to understand the i before e except after c rule there is a great bit on thathe is good at poking at modern absurdities  i saw something in the store the other day that i dont understand that peanut butter and jelly in the same jar is there a point to that brian can point out existential situations in life very well and our fears in a perceptive way with cosmic humor its also kidfriendly without anything vulgardeefamous es ations on life love work truth and motivation with questions to ponder|1
this is an incredible album and i cant imagine that anyone would not enjoy it  the music on it is all from films that won or were nominated for academy awards in music which pretty much guarantees an excellent choice of pieces here  david glen hatch and marden pond have done a fantastic job creating arrangements of some of these most beloved movie music themes  hatchs performing in particular is lush with emotion and energy  he is a fantastic concert pianist and stands among the very best in both the classical and popular fields he has remarkable depth in his playing that allows him to change masterfully from exciting and energetic in the et themes to heartbreakingly passionate in my heart will go on to thoughtful and poetic in dawn etc  the beautiful violin and cello duets with hatch in schindlers list and love letters are also excellent touching performances and complement hatchs playing wonderfully  something also has to be said about marden ponds brilliant orchestrations  they are full of originality and really help to add color to the piano music  i especially love the creativity and magic of the orchestrations in when you wish upon a star  i was trying to think of my favorite tracks on this album but they are all so great that i just cannot choose  this is one of my favorite alltime albums and is a must have for music lovers especially those who love movie themes|1
paulette carlson was the former front woman of the country group highway 101  this solo album released back in 1991 was a huge disappointment for me  some of the songs ill start with you are okay  but most of the songs were too boring  ms carlson never shouldve embarked on a solo career because both have suffered from the parting  highway 101 has never regained their former top ten glory with succeeding lead vocalists and as for ms carlson where is she now|0
rhino vinyl is nothing but junk ive bought albums from many different establishments and 34 of the rhino vinyl albums i buy new do not play in any of our turn tables they skip all over the place and its not listenable nor enjoyable even repurchases of the exact same album from different stores in different months have found to skip in the exact same spot i will not be buying a rhino vinyl product again|0
ive already written a review of this album but i must say over the course of the last few months ive come to appreciate it even more by now i own 4 pink floyd albums dark side of the moon meddle the wall and  wish you were here i actually think the last of these is their best  still the wall stands as probably the best album lyrically of the bunch  the words just grow on you and provide wonderful insight into celebraty and  even simple humanity it honestly gets better after each listen  and  contrary to many critics the album is not a sellout because it is not at  all mainstream the pacing for one is not exactly that of pop music and few  songs are remotely catchy i think there are many other reasons for the  albums success the creativity and originality are hard to ignore the  lyrics spoke and still speak to many people in an incomparably emotional  way thus the mass appeal  i think everyone who reads this has been made  aware of the best tracks on this album so i wont get into that except to  say that many of the somewhat shorter easierto ignore songs are quite  impressive and moving such as goodbye blue sky one of  my turns dont leave me now vera the  show must go on in the flesh and waiting for the  worms and that comfortably numb is one of the best songs  ever  in short i highly recommend listening to the album the entire way  through after purchasing learning the lyrics and eventually getting into  the other recordings|1
michael was at my house the summer before this album was releasedhe was so excited as it was his first christmas album  after all these years its still my favorite of hisi buy copies every year for someone new on my list  he always love old hymns etc and i was really very happy with the way this cd turned out and how he put a new twist on some old favorite christmas music|1
anyone who enjoys pink floyd knows the value of this awesome album i bought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it the delivery went much better than expected which made this purchase a pleasant experience|1
book title resonanceauthor a j scudierepublisher griffyn inkisbn 0979931003reviewed by michele tater for review the booki found this book scientifically fascinating it was divide up into 27chapters which takes the reader through what is called a polar shift i found that the scientific jargon that is found all through resonance to be explained in such a way that most would understand what was happening it also showed that mother earth is an unpredictable and uncontrollable force that we have to respect i do not think the author wrote this to give a explanation of the mayan 2012 doomsday theory if anything it does give another hypothesis on how the dinosaur may have gone extinctsince that was no real main character the reader is given several options to choose from to like dislike and possibly to relate to in the beginning each person in the book is doing research in different scientific fields such as biology geology and disease control sometimes this array of scientists was difficult to keep track of i actually found it helpful to list them on a sheet of paper just in case i forgot who was who i found that i could associate with some personality tract of each character and i became engrossed in the events they all had to experience although the best minds were at work the event was not fully understood or somehow stopped after the polar shift has occurred there are even more questions and events to be analyzed in my opinion one of the most shocking of these questions was why were just a few people seem to be going into a coma like state and then wake up several hours later describing a visit to second earthlike place also later in the book two characters have to make a moral decision which to me was a difficult dilemma but one that had to be donethis book had made science fun and interesting it is a quick read with likable characters i would recommend it to adult and even to younger advanced readers especially for science buffs and doomsday theory enthusiasts|1
i have only resently became a big pink floyd fan i have always liked some of there songs songs but i was not a huge fan until this there are so many good songs on it and the blend together so well i suggest that any music  fan should by this|1
this guy has such a kidfriendly voice and all the songs are just amazing my 3 year old loves his music|1
when you compile the list of the 10 albums you would want if you were stranded on a desert island this one might possibly get the most votes not only is it one of the alltime greats but it is a double album which has to factor into itas far as concept albums go this could be the last truly great one weve experienced and perhaps the greatest concept album ever with apologies to tommy by the who which cant match the power of this album|1
great buy  i would recommend this sellerthe cd played without any problems  i am happy with this purchase  thanks again|1
let me say one thingjoey lawrenceyou cant sing you sound like 8 diff people trying to sing one songyou should really just stick to acting personaly i do not own any of his stuff but i was on amazon and i stumbled upon this and listened to the samples and i must admiti laughed very hard when i heard joey trying to singit was really funny but thats about itif you have a brain in your head you will stay away from the junk if you want to hear some real music you should check out westlifeleave this hasbeen loser alone and i strongly advise you do not even listen to the samples well unless you want a good laugh hahaha|0
i ran an in home daycare for 15 years we played raffi music all the time i found this cd set and now that i have a grandson i wanted to introduce him to the songs as well we have it in the car and we always play it when we are driving even my 14 year old catches himself singing the songs but hed kill me if he knew i told you that|1
lovely collection of raffis top tunes  singable lyrics catchy melodies entirely appropriate subjects  much more kidoriented and less processed sound than disney collections  several creative  twists on the familiar such as the santa version to shell be comin  round the mountain as well as several international favorites|1
despite what mr bitterness said drummer nick mason had a lot of influence over pink floyds music between 6973 here his main contribution was the sound effects and richard wright was in too late to have much of a  contribution its been said before but this is david gilmours third solo  album as such its actually pretty good i would put terminal  frost on the turning away and learning to  fly on a floyd playlist two other tracks sorrow and  one slip show improvement over gilmours last solo endeavours  however if we insist on going by the name on the sleeve this is not up to  pink floyd standards the lyrics are not up to waters level  and while g  roger waters may indeed be the egomaniac his former colleagues brand him  he was and remains a brilliant writer the music is good but not good  enough to be pink floyd i suggest newcomers listen to dsotm and wywh in  particular also meddle and animals before commenting david gilmour has  in fact done better music let me also add that a new machine  beats out anything as the worst moment in floyds songbook this is a nice  record but not a necessary addition to your collection|0
i was given this cd as a gift years ago and still listen to it on every road trip i take  my husband and i e it all the time to each other and i love it so much that i just gave it as a christmas gift to my dad|1
30 years ago raffi set the standard a standard nobody has been able to match since then sure there are choices for childrens music but nobody has made a lifelong career writing and performing the worlds best family friendly music raffi has even written and performed for the dalia lama who in turn has written the forward to raffis child honoring if youre looking to have fun with and enrich your children raffi never fails he is the gold standard and this collection contains the cornerstones to his career a great collection starter|1
though i respect the beatles for their songwrittingsir george martin as a producer this set is very averagethe lyrics are downright badthe music is for the most part uninspiredi dug while my guitar gently  weepsback in the ussrrevolution 1but overall the music seems  formula drivencompared to dylanjames brownmotownhendrixetc  they seem played outthis is one of the most overrated albums ever|0
i was looking for elton johns version of englands rose  this is confusing with one rather nondescript review and no listings of songs or artists i cant tell whether elton is even on this album amazon you can do better|0

i had the great misfortune my first semester of college sharing a room with a dice fan  right before most folks realized just how truly mediocre to put it kindly andrew dice clay islet me clarify one thing first  my problem was not the offensiveness of the diceclown  hes dirty vulgar offensive bla bla bla  yeah lets get past that for a moment thats not what concerns methere are good vulgar comedians  clay is not one of them  clay isnt just bad hes aggressively bad  most of his act is just ramblings of things that sound curiously familiar from the playground at gradeschool  by that i mean its pretty much hey check this out i made another doodie but none of it is really clever  at no point listening to this yoyo did i ever say to myself man where did he ever come up with that one  how did he even think of that  this man is not a slick writer that is the key piece of my problems with him  his is not complex clever material  i dont think hes a good story teller either  and dirty nursary rhymes  who cant come up with those on their own  you take preexisting material that is fundamentally simple in design with already laid out rhyme schemes and simple digestable rhythm structures  make it sexual  it aint that hard  by fifth grade most of us have been able to successfully compose a dirty limmerickclay was a momentary novelty act and yes the fad was big and lucrative for a little while but the star faded  how does george carlin stick around for decades and decades  carlin can write good material and he can still surprise us  after listening for five minutes to the dicechild nothing he says is really ever surprisingam i being unfair  i really dont think so  i admit the guy was good at coming up with some catch phrases for himself which admittedly was tempting to use around the halls of my dorm  he played his character well but when the night is over thats really all it is  a character  a cartoon even like larry the cable guy  and regardless of how well he plays this character at no point do i find myself in awe of the mans mind  guys like izzard i wonder how anyone can keep up with him  guys like clay  i moved way past him  this album was a waste of time im sorrybut like i said im not hating him just cuz were all supposed to hate him ive justified it with reasons|0
its amazing to have a rush album of this quality in the year 2012  they have somehow mixed most of the aspects sans some of the keyboards of the eighties of their long history into one wonderful album  these guys were a positive influence in my life when i was a teenager its awesome to hear them at this high level again geddys bass playing and tone are truly astounding an all time great instudio performance including any genre of music great stuff|1
i was never a huge fan of slash or gnr for that matter  pretty good but not great i always thought slash was overrated and more of an image thing ive heard him outside of gnr on a few oneoff projects hendrix tribute and muddy waters tribute and the solos sounded the same and stalebut i heard standing in the sun on the radio and i liked it enough to try this cd holy crap is it good standing in the sun is the weakest cut on the cdim also a myles kennedy fan his vocals are perfectly suited for this heavy rock but unlike alter bridge these songs are not all power ballads now i like power ballads and alter bridge but they get old same formula etc but these songs are just straightforward heavy rock powerful riffheavy and showoff chops each different and great i am officially a slash fan now|1
pink floyds theatrical rock opera the wall still sounds outstanding nearly 30 years after it was releasedthe album takes you into the mind of a rock star who loses every inch of whatever is left of his sanity secludes himself from all the troubles of his own troubled little world builds an imaginary wall in his mind made of all the people his abusive schoolteachers mother and girlfriend and events in his life his dad dying in the war that have seriously screwed him up and dives head first into a dark world of tv drugs temptation and utter crazinessthe music on the wall is brilliant from the opening track in the flesh passing through the commerically successful another brick in the wall the silent primal screams of mother and goodbye blue sky the elusive nobody home and comfortably numb and the chaotic run like hell all the way to the finale the album sways and streaks to true rock perfectionthe supplementary movie version of the album pink floyds the wall is a must see to truly appreciate and understand the storyline of one of the most remarkable rock albums of recent historyrecommendeda|1
this is a very funny comedy album me and my sister in law loves this album and we have over 100 albums for trips we make this one is a must|1
this album came out the year i was a senior in high school  i also wanted another brick as the senior song but it was turned down  many years later i still listen to this album  its definitely better than most  concept albums though it has its share of weirdness along with stark  beauty  it ranks a notch below dark side of the moon and wish you were  here for me  now if only the liner notes and lyrics were more legible  |1
pink floid is one of the best bands ever there will never be another like it and there will never be any other one to be compared to this great band they were and will allway be one of the best|1
rush has put out another great cd its a concept album and the songs are good and the playing is stellar it is hard to believe that they still have so much energy and creativity the garden is a classic and it ends the cd in fine fashion rush to get this one|1
this is a great album with a hint of the first album high vocals and driving guitars but also with a bit of grunge like their last couple albums i still like the early perreleases of by2b and caravan the best and was somewhat disappointed the other songs didnt quite hold up the quality of these two songs wish them well is probably the next best song with the antichrist coming in fourth this is probably unfair to those of you who like the new rushgrunge experiment but i think rush should stick to what their good at driving hard rock and soft ballads overall i give this album a b on memorability its a good attempt which could have been great if all the songs went back to their rockin roots of working man|1
obviously this album is a classic its my favorite album of all time but the new 2012 vinyl edition sounds like an old record i borrowed from my uncle  i am just getting into vinyl but all my other new vinyl sounds miles above this i dont know whether i got a dud or if theyre all going to be this hissy and pop filled  hopefully they fix the problem before they release a mono set i only bought this because they didnt do it in mono  guess  ill stick with my mono cd set until thenafter a few days i want to update this review  i took the album to a friends house and listened on his 2k vpi turntable with 6k mcintosh tube preamp i have a 600 vintage thorens turntable and a 50 rolls preamp for now and the album sounded a bit better but there was still obvious noisy vinyl under that amazing music  then i cleaned the album with his vpi vacuum record cleaner  listening again at home it is not as bad as it was the first time i listened but there is just a noisy quality to the whole thing especially between songs and at the end of the sides its positively horrible  just think about the end of i want you shes so heavy and how its supposed to go dead silent but instead theres just this noise as the needle goes to the middle and then the same thing in the 10 seconds between the end and her majesty  noise and not just typical vinyl noise  this album is going back to amazon in hopes of getting a better copy the next go round  though from other reviewers i have doubts that it will get better  i have also gone ahead and bought the uk version from amazoncouk  for 10 more you can get the uk issue  not that we should have toone more update i received the eu pressing from amazoncouk and it sounds so much better so much quieter  i actually hear what seems like the master tape instead of the new vinyl in the background  i will probably buy more of the eu pressings and cross my fingers that the problems are fixed before they release the mono set|0
the music is okay but the recording studio was poor  the current generation of vargas musicians is much better prepared from a technical  world exposure perspective|0
we heard carlos reyes this summer at a concert in californias wine country he plays the harp and violin and we were very impressed with his talentspeople were on their feet dancing and yelling for encoresthis cd must be one of his earlier ones and is very tamewould be great for background music i wanted to hear his toetapping heart racing type music that he played amongst the vineyards this isnt it so if you like elevator type harp music this cd is for you|0
this album is right up there with 2112 and moving pictures i love it  the last song on the album the garden just shot to my favorite top 5 favorite rush songs great album guys i am looking forward to seeing them in concert this fall in seattle your opinion of my review will vary|1

buyer beware it is not clearly stated that this will not play on most us players not happy that it ruined my husbands fathers day surprise|0
i bought this cd years ago and still enjoy listening to it a christmas time  it has a number of traditional songs and is very instrumental thoughout dont worry you hear lots of michael too  the only critism i have is that at times the cd can get either really loud or really quiet so i find myself playing with the volume as i listen  its a great cd and i would recommend it to everyone|1
review based on 180 gram lp wow my copy looks just like it does in amazon label  alli bought this years ago when i was collecting 180 gram lps i may of seen the movie twice because i always have been an ingrid bergman fan the mere sight of seeing her in tears on the front cover is enough to buy the album the music of coarse goes with the 1943 film for whom the bells tolls a remake of an ernest hemingways novel which she stars with gary cooper its the spanish civil war before world war 2 with the loyalists against the fascists gary cooper plays robert jordan a dynamite expert not interested in life until he meets ingrid bergman who plays an orphan girl that was mishandled by the fascists they fall in love until an untimely end the music is by victor young  many say this is his finest creation typical 1940ish bombastic semiclassical music intermixed with spanish dancing tunes recording is top notch with wide clean stereo not bad but not as good as those tears|1
i think most people underappreciatespelled righti love this album itss awasome hey thats just my opinion but its better than the sorry excuse for rock we have today i dont see cold play or fat ass joe writing anything better|1
the nadir of pink floyds recorded output the final cut began life as a dumping ground for leftover songs from the wall and soundtrack versions from the film of the same name  in the end the soundtrack songs never made it onto the album  of the leftovers those that were considered not good enough for the wall floyd guitarist dave gilmour said that if they werent good enough to release before what makes them any good nowgilmour is right on the mark the songs on the final cut rank among the worst in the bands history  there is a complete lack of melody on the entire album the songs are slow plodding and limp  one is hard pressed to even consider this a rock album  it is the ultimate spit in the eye of syd barretts pink floyd which was full of fun excitment and musical inventiveness  the waters lead floyd heard here sounds more like a man occasionally waking himself up from a deep sleep by snoring too loudlysince waters completely dominated the band on the final cut all musical considerations are secondary to his halfsung lyrics  and waters is without a doubt one of the worst singers in rock meaning that this is a worst case senario  in fact a case can be made for never listening to the album again|0
this cd has half the songs from the original album it includes songs from several other beatles records shame on me for not reading the fine print|0
i heard the beatles album rubber soul the one with their one hit norwegian wood  that song was good and the other filler songs wereehflipping my hand around like to say ehhhh you knowi always saw these guys as a one hit wonder  but someone said you gotta hear abbey road by them  and i was like  okay apparently this band was an influence for great bands like hermans hermits and new order and stuff so i thought okayif i can find it ill chekc it out  i found it  checked it out  uhever heard of a word called porduction lads  theyi dont know when one song ends and the other stops  they have different lead singers for every song  the songs have no thru line or melody to speak of  i see here that some people gave this thing 5 stars  hello  what  theres a reason you never hear of these guys any more  theyre probably all living in a shack trying to live on their little checks for norwegian wood|0

1980 for james levine with renata scotto then in the 1980s there was the metropolitan opera tv broadcast with hildegard behrens and around the time of this 1990 recording he again appeared in a film shot in rome with catherine malfitano domingo thought of himself as an operatomovie actorcrossover each cavaradossi prior to this one is excellent particularly the 1980 recording but gone is the dark coating in his voice and the brilliant squillo instead here he sings with more dramatic skill and is now so used to singing cavaradossi that it seems he can sing it in his sleep he sings with secure high register and of course he is able to slip into whispers fortissimi and passionate and heroic outbursts but you can tell that this one is his farewell to cavaradossi its still wonderful and everything placido domingo sings is magic he is a dramatic tenor who not only looks good but lives each of his rolesfor mirella freni this tosca found her in her second round she had recorded what some consider a miraculous tosca opposite pavarotti and sherill milnes for decca she is past her prime in this recording and its evident by this point that she had damaged her once beautiful and pure lyric voice so perfect for roles like micaela in carmen mimi violetta susanna in figaro juliette and marguerite in faust she took on heavier lyrico spinto and dramatic repertoire like aida tosca don carlos madame butterfly and manon lescaut she was at least wise enough to sing in her native italian except when she crossed over to french and then russian upon marrying bass nicolai ghiurov when she sang tatiana in eugene onegin her golden instrument was ruined when she took on too many dramatic roles and tosca was one of them this one finds freni at her absolute worst i dont see why so many operaphiles seem to like this one and the reviews here declare her spectacular i didnt like what i heard she sounds tired pushed melodramatic in a less natural and more affected way and in her high notes and fortissimi she has a very wobbly vibrato and sharp unflatering top she sounds very old too her tosca is purely experimental as were here aidas the only successful dramatic role she took on was madame butterfly and fortunately for her fans myself included she sang it three times on record with pavarotti domingo for a film and with jose carreras for deutsche grammophon in one of sinopolis better recordings she also did a marvelous manon lescaut under sinopoli opposite domingo for dg but tosca is way out of her league i wanted to like frenis tosca i really did but she is terrible and didnt satisfy there are moments however which find her doing fantastic things with the voice such as the rapid slides into chest register in act 1 and 2 and her purely lyric moments the best example being the duets with domingos cavaradossi and her vissi darte is very admired but her tosca is shabby and only hardcore fans will enjoy it i am a freni fan but i was not thrilled with her toscassamuel ramey too is out of his league as scarpia no matter how many praises he garnered from critics and opera lovers he did something similar to freni his baritone voice has a rich dark and lyric quality so perfect for bel canto and early verdi opera in which he even had a gift for the baritone version of coloratura he is equally as impressive in the french repertoire like the devil in gounods faust or in berlioz damnation of faust as well as the villains in offenbachs tales of hoffman all of these starring baritone roles he started his career singing small baritone roles in the 1970s in operas like massenets manon and as angelotti in the colin davis tosca with montserrat caballe and jose carreras he then took on the bigger baritone roles like don giovanni and the biggest one of all scarpia unfortunately his scarpia is lackluster he puts no real intensity or evil bite into his performance he sounds the same no matter what he sings and its a pity he cant act ive seen him perform on stage and he just stands there makes faces closes his eyes and sings but doesnt act he became very famous for being an american baritone after the decline of the more famed baritones like lawrence tibbett robert merrill leonard warren and sherill milnes his scarpia is nothing like that of tito gobbi george london giuseppe taddei and many others who produce very monstrous scarpias his scarpia is too refined and lacks passionfinally another flaw in this tosca is conductor sinopoli he has expertly conducted the scores to puccinis madame butterfly and manon lescaut his tosca with domingo and behrens a live broadcast from the met is wonderful but the quality of his conducting for this tosca is lousy admittedly he is an old man by this point and it wasnt long before he died of cancer still the pacing is downright plodding and far too slow to be truly exciting or dramatic its an expansive long and very boring tosca the orchestra is loud and it has an epic sweep but even karajans toscas with price in 62 and ricciarelli in 79 who still maintained an epic score makes it excitingly dramatic and yet lyrical sinopoli seems to involved with his own version of tosca which he seems to make into some longwinded clinical verisimo opera its so slow and it forces his singers to sing purely for the sake of tone and beauty and not drama this is sinopoli at his worst and he makes a tosca that is too boring and too haunting rather than being dynamic and dramaticdont make this your first tosca if you absolutely must buy this do it it for domingos always perfect cavaradossi its really a shameful tosca and i consider it the worst ever made you can never go wrong with maria callas toscas zinka milanov renata tebaldi leontyne prices toscas and caballe scotto galina vishnevskaya ricciarelli carol vaness jane eaglen and angela gheorghiu my favorite is galina vishnevskaya who takes the crown as far as how to sing with intensity and ferociosness and yet feminine beauty|0
simply stated this album is insanely good from beginning to end there are no filler tracks definitely spend the extra money to get the bonus tracks carolina one last thrill anastasia apocalyptic love bad rain hardfast are all tied for first in my bookalso the bonus version comes with a code to redeem for a free tshirt i had to pay 650 for shipping but the 25 shirt was freea true rock album|1
i think this is one of the few sacd albums that sound is the same than the cd version i had great expectations from this sacd since its a classic from the 80s thats why i was willing o pay 50 usd extra for the quality but to my surprise i hear almost no difference in sound quality if you find it 20 usd or below buy it  otherwise dont bother i own mcintosh gear and martin logan speakers i mean its not mbl or goldmund but i believe they are transparent enough to hear differences and they are tiny tiny ones|0
it was difficult to decide just how to rate this item on the one hand toscaninis performance with the nbcso was as usual very impressive although maybe lacking somewhat in understanding of how the symphony should be interpreted  which may account for shostakovichs dismissal of this performance whatever the merits of the performance rcas remaster was terrible i am used to 78 rpm mono remasters and expect some surface noise along with mysterious clicks and rattles but this remaster was so over burdened with extraneous noise and loud repetitive clicks that it is really hard to listen to i am going to get karl ancerls mono recording from the mid 1950s it is almost as good a performance with much better mono sound per multiple reviews|0
it brings back great memories we landed on the moon and then sgt pepper roomers going round that paul was dead that this was there last alblum meanwhile i learned how to the play every beatle song ever written joined a rock band and in 1971 i visited abbey road|0
in true rush fashion they change things up in this new album  this one is a little harder than some of the other albums but the lyrics are still top of the food chain|1
ive got johns dvd im stavin and my wife and i think its great i got his cd instead of the i say nay nay dvd because of the reviews here but i cant see why the reviews are so wonderfula major part of johns routine is how he looks acts and reacts to the stories he tellshard to do in a cdjohn apparently also has enough material for one show and nothing new so whether you get his two dvds or a mixture of dvds and cds most of the bits are the samesave your money unless you are a really big pinette fan|0
the vinyl pressing is defective and of a very poor quality there are too many scuffs scratches clicks and pops its really sad when you consider there are pressing plants in the world today devoted to producing superior quality vinyl records clearly emiapple for reasons unknown to me have chosen a pressing plant with quality control issues  i am very disappointed with the overall quality of the vinyl i can only hope emiapple may produce a second run of pressings and team up with a pressing plant devoted to quality control maybe someone like rti or mobile fidelity sound labs could take control of the pressingsin the world of beatles box sets many editions andor pressings have been produced down thru the years in my collection i happen to own 1 the 1978 parlophone beatles bc 13 blue box set and 2 the 1982 mobile fidelityemi  box set pressed by the victor company  in japan on virgin vinyl  if i were to put aside all questions comments criticisms andor debates regarding the mastering of the recordings and merely focus on the quality of the vinyl  well its easy  the 1982 vinyl pressings are clearly the gold standard  the 1978 pressings come in at second place and the new 2012 pressings are dead last place again i can only hope emi apple might consider a second run of pressings with a manufacturer  devoted to superior audiophile quality|0
this is not even close to the quality that you will hear on volume onestarting with an annoying atonal indulgent piece i was hoping the rest would be goodof course the grieg piece is wonderful but i have other recordings of it just as finei was hoping for beauty in the unknown but the rhapsodies are common sounding andoverall the disc is not what it purports to bequiet or reflective a sad find|0
being a 17 year old in a mainstream rap and techno music world is kind of tough despite that i am a lover of 40s80s music and rush is one of my favorites i personally like every one of their albums with their debut being my favorite clockwork angles was one of my reasons to live two years ago when it was announced when i bought the album vinyl to be exact i put it on my turntable and listened caravan is one of my favorite songs by far the song is heavy and clear after caravan i noticed that geddys voice is much too reverbed and it sometimes becomes unclear what instrument is playing what if you listen to it enough times though you will be able to hear it and it will sound much clearer overall this album is great for the amount of albums rush has released over their 38 years of playing keep rockingalbum 4 out of 5 stars 1 star due to the reverby effects of geddys voice and the sometimes unclear roles of the instruments hard to hear whats playing whatps when these songs are played live it sounds absolutely amazing there is no reverb at all|1
this doubledisc masterpiece is undoubtedly pink floyds greatest album if you can only own one album by this band make it the wall this cd takes listeners into the mind of a madman who is going insane building a wall around himself many of the bands greatest hits though certainly not all are contained on this album i highly recommend this to any true rock and roll fan over here in finland we love pink floyd|1
the wall cannot be fully appreciated on thr speakers oin yiur car the wall cannot be appreciated on the little speakers on your computer the wall cannot be appreciated with the standard cartridge and stylus that comes standard in moist turntables get this 180 gram vinyly copy of the wall get a good cartidge anf stylus for your record player and get some good speakers like bws and be prepared to hear music like its really supposed to be experienced and play loud the wall is great rock and roll but on vinyl its amazing and by upgrading your system speakers and cartridge and styus to 2014 technology the wall is magic|1
the item was damaged when i received it i did not returned it because the freight charge might be almost the same as the product itself|0
i thought i was buying a british product but this is from argentina  has the look of a knockoff  songs sound good but i would prefer a disc without compyright notice in spanish|0
nice album would have been a lot better with the track recorded with the spears why did it end|0
i did not like this soundtrack one bit  first of all i didnt like the movie because it made batman look stupid and dull  batman is a dark detective he scares his opponents  just like the tim burton movies  danny elfman is gone and its nothing  whats with this elliot goldenthal score making it sound some what like a superhero theme  danny elfmans score for the original batman was awesome and i always read the comics while listening to his music  batman returns was even better with the addition of the chorus  you cant read batman vs predator without listening to batman returns just a suggestion to comic bookbatman fans out there  anyway dont buy this batman forever piece|0
yes static didnt sound like any waterfalls i had ever heard was not relaxing at all|0
rush boasts an amazing body of work spanning periods defined by specific musical styles from the longform concept albums of the 70s to the synthladen more radio friendly tracks of the 80s to the grungier more straight ahead rock of the 90s to the power trio rebirth starting with vapor trails  clockwork angels is really all of those periods brilliantly captured and rolled into one masterpiece of an album  thats enough words listen for yourself|1
granted roger has some great ideas and fantastic lyrics througout floyds career but i can do without this depressing grating sonic misadventure  i totally enjoy most that is floyd but this one is the worst  as uneven as momentary lapse of reason is at least there are musical parts on that one which is pleasing to listen to not so on the final cut  i have friends who love this album but it is beyond me as to why if you liked pros and cons of hitchhiking then by all means indulge in cut ill stick with the true floyd albums  funky dung this aint|0
before i flunk this i have an ipod 8g nano thats about 80  full of classical and i am looking all the time for more only i just like this classical that is easy flowing and lots of instruments not solos just all easy flowing and no cut and boom boom this and that in it i am finding this hard to find for sale at a decent price for whatever reason seems everything i find cheap is boom boom booooom boom bang pow dun dun dunnnnnnnnn boom boom boooooooomlameafter hearing about this no 9 for a long time some of the best recorded then why is it selling for 1 centi so dont care for this kind of symphony how can anyone listen to thisthat is what ruins any symphony music so i am a newbie to understanding how to find what i want is there a name for the free flowing stuff vrs this boom boom boooooooooom stuff i want it all to be level same flow all through no suprises as in its flowing along then boom boom boooom duun dunnnnnnnn then back to simple flow yet i do not want reaaaaallll slow stuff either funeral music or whatever its called just free flowing all the same through music is there a name for this or is this to much to ask haha|0
i was a big fan of rush in the late 70s and early 80s and then drifted away recently i bought this album to see where they are today and i am thoroughly humbled by their phenomenal talent the songs are awesome and seem to weave on a few occasions several melodies into one piece something that can only be done after many seasons of musical poetry experimentation and orchestration let this album grow on you and be amazed at where time has brought this band after all these decades|1
smith himself received such rapturous praise in the on the wholevery goodpenguin guide sixth edition that i thought id give this one a try i should have paid more attention to two little facts1they didnt mention this particular recording at all2lotsa copies were available dirt cheap on amazon marketplaceto make a short story even shorter this is an album of absolutely unrelieved triteness and tediousnessas to musical contentit fails to reach the kenny gdavid sanborn level you could probably find two or three kids who could produce this sort of pap at any urban high school as far as the quality of the recordingproduction goesit sounds as though the rhthym section is placed closest to the listener at one end of an airplane hangarwith smith noodling away at the other end for all i knowsmith is as good as they say and this swill was somehow imposed on him by the suits at capitol or some trusted but deeply misguided career advisorperhaps his other cds justify the guides truly extravagant praise this particular onehowever is a stench in the nostrils of jazzif a rating lower than one star were availableit would deserve it|0
a classic case of one good track on the albumthe opening main themeand everything else is filler buy the theme track 1 from itunes forget everything else and i do mean everything|0
the cd was payable but the case was in horrible conditionit looked like it had been ran over by a car ive had numerous cds but never anything like thisdid i mention that it was labeled as very good|0
although i have the remastered cd of abbey road i decided to treat myself and buy the vinyl version  big mistake  commencing on the first side starting with the third song the high ends are distorted  i first thought it was my equipment  however when i played the white album i just received it sounded great  it was clearly the album i am returning it since i know i will never listen to it again  i am dissapointed the beatles are my favorite band and i was looking forward to owning this on vinyl  save your money and buy the remastered cd of this album which sounds amazing|0
a charming and romantic little operetta by noel coward his first postwar work  set in a fictional south pacific outpost of empire in the nineteenth century that has somehow attained the glamour of the indian raj in spite of starring mary martin it had a disappointing run  although it does have some wonderful coward songs uncle harry and i wish i wasnt quite such a big girl in particularalas it was never well recorded a set of 78 rpm discs covered most of the music but they were of unusually poor sonic quality for the 1940s  sounding more like something from the 1920s they were rereleased on an lp that in spite of some cleaning up remained a very poor representation of how the original production must have soundedand sadly this cd release is if anything worse than the lp  there is no discernible trace of any attempt to improve the sound at allonly worth it if you are a very keen noel coward fan and then only because pending a revival or a decent studio recording of the work this is the only recording available|0
ah the sins of youth  i wrote and published this review in march 1999 on amazoncom  i also published the unaltered 1999 review in january 2001 on amazoncouk  i had only been listening to the beatles for a couple of years at that point in 1999 and had heard the majority of their material by that time  by 2000 i had heard all their recordsi stand by my initial assessment this is the beatles worst studio album and mr moonlight is their worst recording commercially released  however time has drastically softened my view of beatles for sale  while still the beatles worst album this is some of the best music from that era undoubtedly the fact this is their worst album really reflects on the quality of the beatles output in general as opposed to a legitimate criticism against beatles for sale in particular for an album from 1964 you dont get much better than beatles for sale  just listen to some of the beach boys early lps and youll see what i meanthe review has apparently struck a chord with some of the readers judging by the comments  first off my writing has drastically improved  i even use spellcheck now  for the reader who suggested i should google franz schubert in 1999 google was not all the rage as it is today  no wikipedia back then either  but no worries ive done some research on schubert since writing this review  consider that riddle solved mike london 1222012first off it should be stated that i am more into the late period beatles than anything well actually mid my favorite beatles material is anything from rubber soul on i have heard some of their early stuff but not a lot unfortunately the only record album cd i own of their early material is their worst beatles for sale all that being said lets get on with the reviewthe beatles revered as the most innovative group ever are nothing save decadent whores on this one and emi is the pimp beatlemania was at the prime and they had to produce product this is all this is even the title states it beatles for sale the beatles knew this was product and that is all economics wouldnt allow them to create a masterpiece with this one they make barely a serviceable album with this one let alone a masterpiecethey also produce some of their most selfloathing material ever almost half the record is dedicated to misery the opening triad aka the triad of misery is indeed one of the most sad and tragic song cycles ever conceived 10 12 and 13 are relationships on the rocks thats almost half the album right there i think that if the beatles really wanted to construct an allout depressing record it would be a masterpiece but this isnt it thats almost half the album right there the other half is illconceived covers andor originals that are little better than average tunes making this by far the weakest of all their albums even weaker than please please me actually please please me isnt that bad especially that twist  shout its rather ironic the greatest songwriters ever rely on cover material to see their way thru on this oneoriginally this was part of a much longer review but because of space i as forced to cut it there was more commentary besides the track review anyway here that is this is my track by track review of this record13 these are good serviceable tracks i call them the triad of misery1 no reply a depressing song about a cheating girlfriend its songs like this and run for yr life that make lennon to be the hypocrite that he is in his songs he bitches about cheating and yet he destroys his family with an adulterous affair with yoko ono he obviously knew neither jesus christ or cared about his family in ways he disgusts me and yet this is not the love of god adultery is a bitter subject for me and i cannot be real objective but i try and i listen2 im a loser self confessional good song3 babys in black another sad mistery song i like it prime stuff the triad and eight days a week is easily the best stuff on this record4 rock and roll music horrible berry cover i dont care i dont like this cover at all its interesting to hear them do a cover of berry and truthfully it fits in right along with this album it helps demonstrate just how bad this record truly is5 ill follow the sun weak track from mcc back when he was like 17 they used it as a last minute resort to take up space on this trashy album6mr moonlight the absolute worst of the worst of the worst of any beatles tracks dont you dare say revolution  9 is worst that is one sound collage that actually works there arent a lot of bad beatles songs but this is definitely one of bad ones often regarded by true fans as a disgrace this is the most notorious track of their career they ever recorded with the possible exception of their sound collage7 medley kansas cityhey hey hey old covers resorted at last resort more like bootleg material than anything8 eight days a week only big hit from this album this is one of the better more serviceable tracks on this record actually its classic early beatles wished i could say the same about the rest of this horrid set9 words of love ill conceived cover although it is one of the better covers on this record10 honey dont now we get to the ringo song on this horrendous record ringo generally has an interesting song or two on the beatles records but unfortunately this one aint it just like the record this simply doesnt cut it11 every little thing decent early beatles song  nothing classic though12 i dont want to spoil the party ditto a little bit more musical variation but still the basic formula13 what yr doing basically a lonely sad song ties in rather nicely with the opening triad of misery i guess so does 1214 everybodys trying to be my baby man i hate that problem such a nuisance   definitely no day in the life closer here or even good night her majesty is a better closer harrison is so buried in echo its patheticconsidering who made this it makes this record even more atrocious and to think this is the same band that made sgt peppers lonely hearts club band in contrast to their other great albums it just magnifies this albums flaws a hundred a thousand a million times over sgt pepperalbum of the millennium it was voted that recently in a british pole well i vote for this to be the worst but it is also a testament  in less than three years they produced sgt pepper after this garbage and this isnt counting the three trend setting ground breaking records they release after this before that watershed recordsomeone said that most people have never heard of this record  there is a reason for this this is a blot on the honour of them as musicians this is by far their worst record give me let it be or even yellow submarine over this damned garbage lib had some serviceable tracks it wasnt a sgt pepper but it was a good record nonetheless yellow submarine is weak because of lack of material the four new songs that are on it are pretty damn good though save for all together which is just a childrenlike sing along but still its fun i think its a good song hey bulldog is the closest to a lost beatles song that is truly classic as yr gonna get on hard days night we come to the only fully written set by lennonmccartney it is revered as a pop classic well old emi comes along and at the height of beatlemania demand they make another record they had too under contract so they turn in this sorry excuse for an album they were exhausted every right to be and this set very clearly shows it granted the original material here is decent with the possible exception of ill follow the sun which is the weakest of the originals its pretty average for early beatles actually its a little below par although the opening triad on this record is one of the most depressing ever pressed on vinyl the rest sadly sags and lags entirely behindin the end we come to what is without a doubt the beatles worst lp there is really atrocious material here and no real high lights like on the other records i honestly believe that had this been any other band it would have been forgotten and rightly so well  even at their worst they outclassed the best i think if this was another artist the original material would be something of minor classics perhaps their best herman the hermits come to mind for some reasonso in the end what do i think they should have done if i were the beatles obviously im not and wasnt under contract i would have scraped this entire album just like they did with the much more worthy let it beget back project the material just isnt up to their usual par of excellence the originals off this should have been released as singles and the covers should have remained unheard until the anthology series of recent years would then have unearth them the originals are alright they might have made a good ep even the ep would be about as long as 1847 the covers could be rare obscure tracks thats all they deserve to be then this blunder from the greatest romance ever if you believe all the anthology hype  oh daddy you mean santa isnt real wah would have been removedanyway  just my opinion you might think its the best thing since schubert who the hell is he i keep hearing references to him especially in the yw submarine liner notes not that it matters but i used to think liner was pronounced just like linear anyway  like the thing have to do with linesthink ill go listen to mmt or rubber soul now|0

im not sure  but i can say this pink floyd the wall is not pink floyds best album  then why five stars you ask  because even mediocre floyd is light years better than anything else out there  the wall is a sad album because it represents for all intensive purposes the end of pink floyd  sure they would release 1981s the final cut under the moniker pink floyd but essentially it was roger waters first solo album  the wall has some mesmerizing moments such as the overlooked one of my turns or the haunting beauty of nobody home  the wall combines a nice mixture of gilmours guitar work and waters paranoid delusions concerning the government and society in general  this is not light listening and i would not recommend it to the clinically depressed  on another level the wall works better than most other double albums released with the exception of the beatles white album  most of the tracks are strong but overall the wall is a little too grim for me to listen to on a regular basis  there is little debate that the wall is a rock masterpiece i just dont think its pink floyds  ps  check out the more soundtrack that just might be the best of the best|1
although it is listed under brian may please note its not the actual brian may of queen fame but rather an australian composer who died a few years ago|0
definitely not worth paying 40 bucks for a used copy  what for considering the bands going to reissue all kmfdm back catalogue and theyre all coming out soon  perhaps this will put an end to these blood suckers who sell theyre old wax trax copies for outrageous prices|0

this is not a music cd but is a mini documentary it is cute to see but not what i wanted|0
the soprano is good enough but the tenor is way over his head its as if mimi left rodolfo and ran off with parpignolwith gigli bjoerling di stefano tagliavini bergonzi pavarotti and domingo to choose from why waste your time with this|0
there is always something familiar about rush to rush fans especially but this time it is very familiarthe idea of a concept album that they said they would not do again  geddys vocals like them or notmore on this in a bitpearts unmistakable percussionalexs timely guitar playingyetas familiar as it is clockwork angels is as fresh as when they began  this is perhaps one of their greatest disks yetfirstoff i need to say geddy lee can sing  and he sings very wellon this disk he does exactly what he wants with his voice exactly when he needs tosome people do not like the tone quallity of his voice and thats finewhateveri dont like opera doesnt mean rene flemming cant sing he just compared geddy lee to rene flemming  oh no he didnt bottom line is the voice is one of geds instruments and as a musician you need to have control of your instrument whatever that isand he doesso all the haters can go homeorin the words of stephen a just stop itback to angelsthe typical rush virtuosity is really restrained throughout most of the album  a lot of it occurs in the 1st piece caravan which by the way is a remix of the one released last year as is bu2b  rush fans already know these are both outstanding piecesso if you bought those last year in the album you arent getting the exact same thingalthough the differences are subtle  bottom line is they are both great additions to the rush repertoire  the title cut follows that and is really what rush has always been aboutlonger pieces that dont seem long and when they are over you want more at this point somethings started to stand out 1 although a concept album its still cut up into individual pieces which is not unlike rush but as the entire album is the story its a bit different 2112 was one side so was hemispheres 2 the song writing is the main focus not necessarily the conceptthere are very few musical themes on the album that popup anywhere else this to me is one thing i would have liked to have seen but it takes nothing away 3 rush is still exploring with sounds and techniquethe use of virbrato in several songs is an example as they use it more on this album that they have in all of their albums put togetherthe next 2 pieces could have been on many of rushs previous albumsanarchist and carnies  show equal quality of songwriting and again rush forgoes vituostic soloing for the sake of the songwriting they could have done morebut they were restraineedand it doesnt hurt the song one bitmostly because everything the do is still virtuostic by most standards  another thing the resist on this album is their tendancy to throw in a midsong solo break in 78 or some other odd time signatures  personally i did miss that part  but again i dont think it hurts the compositions at allin a few places it seemed to make room for david campbells string arrangements which are absolutely brilliant in the way they fit in and put the songs over the top  this also points to perhaps a next direction for rush as david campbell was the arranger of the sydney austrailia symphony orchestra for the outstanding kissymphony concerthow about a rush tour or even one off show with and orchestra  just a thoughtanyway halo effect shows that softer side of rush we dont often see but they can be really great at  7 cities of gold is again a reminder of rush at their best with heavy riffs and wailing vocals the next song starts off with almost 60s sounding guitar chords and a keith moon like beatthen continues in a very melodic way again with a cathchy melody i couldnt stop singingnot what i expected from a song called the wreckersheadlong flight is again rush doing what they do or didit is a very familiar tip of the cap towards themselves in the early daysyou can hear bits of bastille day and working manlisten to this one a high volumeyoull thank me laterbu2b2 is rushs version of a sgt pepper reprise but more like the end of 2112 it sets you up for a sad endinglife goes from bad to worsebut this is rush nowso right away they follow with  all the you can do is wish them wellthis disk could have ended with headlong flightbut the rush philosophical words of wisdom need to be impartedthis of course concludes in totally atypical rush fashion with the beautiful ballad the gardenin which they leave you with the words i hope all of you take to heart  the measure of a life is a measure of love and respect so hard to earn so easily burnedhold onto thatthe one constant thing that always amazes me is how they manage to turn a strange melody with atypical words into a singable catchphrase much like a chorus but calling it that seems to cheapen rushex clockwork angels spread their arms and sing sychronized and graceful they move like living things or a wheel of fate a game of chanceor  i have stoked the fire of the big steel wheels steer the airship right across the skiesreallywho writes stuff like that and makes it so you want to know the words so you can sing along  only rushfantastic piece of work  bravo|1
great for what it is a walk through my pimply teenage years in the late 80swhat can i say i wanted to relive that era of my life for a week then i sold the cd to a resale record storeexcellent just as i remembered but since i overplayed it in my geeky youth i felt no need to keep it around from fear that someone might think me a pothead redneck midwest spazstill if yer into the pink buy it|1
as i listened to this album for the first time i looked around for hidden cameras like i was on candid camera or punked i thought for real this album sucks in a major way at least the first outing had decent guitar work on itlets break it down guitar satch is vais mentor vai wouldnt be caught dead on this album my little sister plays better guitar than youll find on this recordvocally while ive been a hagar fan for a long time i think this is his worst work to date more of a half rapscat thing than singing  michael anthonys harmonies for once arent there to save himlyrics half good but so politically and religiously ladden its hard to stomachid be disapointed if friends in a garage band put this out for world class musicians this is nothing short of mortifying|0
some of the lyrics smacks of guilt from days gone by on tha road but otherwise weve got another excellent record from a supergroup rock on sammy keep it flowin joe whats next|1
errr not really haa i mean these guys are ok i really agree with cemetary e  infernalritual on their bashing reviews i definitely think that nile their name doesnt deserve to be capitolized are  overrated comeon folks theyre not that good gee calm down here will  ya  i know all ov u are going to check no next to me review but i  dont care go ahead u peons  trendies if it makes any ov u feel better  i do think the guitars on here sound quite good be on the look our for  incantations latest monsterpiece hopefully infernal storm argghhh  now go and listen to nile like little boys and grrrlllssslaterz|0
to think that they have two failed lps whcih have since been dubbed birth of a legend and yellow matter custard in their pockets and the only rare stuff we get is the beatles with tony sheridan this album is worth steeringh clear of the beatles only appear properly on two songs the first two songs on the other twelve songs tony sheridan is the lead vocalist and only half fo those song feature the beatles on backing the beat brothers are not the beatles oh by the way birth of a legend is an early 1962 lp that they cut for decca who didnt sign them and the bbc didnt sign them on the strength of yellow matter custard which it wasnt originally called third time lucky i suppose but even if they arent as good as please please me or sergeant pepper they are two lps made up entirely of beatles songs and the public and the fans deserve to have these two albums released|0
another masterpiece from rushstill lean more toward the concept lp 2112 for mebut it grows on you with repeat listening|1
i dont know  maybe its just me  but i find her rubatos very heavy and a bit over the top  its like the way that you were first tempted as a child to play chopin  but if you were lucky your piano teacher discouraged it  and apparently someone forgot to tell okashiro that these are etudes and not nocturnes  her tempos are almost uniformly too slow  however the sound quality of this cd is excellent  the best recording of the complete scriabin etudes in my opinion is the piers lane cd|0
who knew romper room with a splash of petty anger could be so awful  pink floyds wall album reminds us all why were so glad the 20th century is over  mundane and myopic testaments to boredom mix with crappy musicianship to produce this the largest pile of artrock crap ever produced  i dont know about you but color me badd sounds pretty good right now  id rather hear henry kissinger recite the periodic table of elements|0
i listen to this cd all the timeand i came across them by accident  i think i found them online and downloaded a song but i was hookedthe whole cd is awesome and i love female rock singers  this one is upbeat and is surely not going to disappoint those who want a feel for new rock|1
i had a hard time getting into this cd first listens until i turned up the volume and then it hit mewow this sounds just like you would here in concert and it packs a powerful punch after that it all became clearrush created the perfect sound that can be faithfully recreated on the road in fact i consider this a kinda studio live recording despite whatever mastering mumbo jumbo went on they erased that line between studio and live and i think they succeeded with flying colors does that mean muddled i dont know but they consciously engineered ca to sound this way it is no mistake due to the time spent to create an epic composition and product ca starts kinda slow but builds and literally thrashes akin to vapor trails refined in places and is very hard and smokin the band dips into their roots and updates with modern prog rockmetal sensibilities to wonderful effect i love this recording|1
great sound quality i like all the songs but 1 three and a half letters is the only let down for me different than the first cd more polished they have stretched out more musically highlights for me are big foot dubal blues different devil alright and last temptation sammys pipes are in fine shape joe is brilliant as always mike and chad seem to really groove in the pocket mikes background vocals are spot on great cd and a great band if you like hard bluesy rock this is for you|1
i too feel that this recording does not compare with the original i would like to help others as well as myself obtain the original cd in order to do that i will need the upc code from the cd i have the lp but it was  issued before the day of upc barcodes if any of you have the barcode  information please forward it to me at oceanview5aolcom|0
one of my favorite works is almost put to boredom with this extremely weak recording do yourself a favor and spend your money on a much better rendition something like the london symphony or better yet find the los angeles philharmonic conducted by leopold stokowski recording be prepared to turn your volume wayup for this one you really do get what you pay for|0
this is probably rushs best album since moving pictures the band plays this entire album in exact order on their brand new live bluray dtshd live concert titled appropriately clockwork angels tour since rush performed the entire album moving pictures on their previous live bluray dtshd live concert titled rush time machine 2011 live in cleveland i feel this has direct baring on how rush feels about comparing clockwork angels to moving pictures this was an appropriate release timing wise for their induction into the rock and roll hall of fame and very probably pushed voters on the fence to finally vote them in if you are a rush fan but like their early material better than stuff they released in 90s and early 2000s this is definitely a cd you should purchase see also snakes and arrows previous release special edition 51 multichannel version dvd for even more outstanding rush material|1
we had a lot of these raffi songs on a cassette tape when our children were small  we purchased this for our grand daughter  some songs never get old  lots of singable tunes for children|1
pretty good but not as good as the first one and i m not sure why  its kind of like there is a lack of inspiration it feels pretty plain and maybe pushed towards lets make some extra moneytype filled albumeven joe is lacking power as if he would not have a lot left i know he s got a lot more to offersong 10 and 1 to me are more favorable than others|1
i heard the single im so sick on the radio a few weeks ago  i bought the selftitled album  i went to their concert a couple of hours agoand now i cant help but write a reviewflyleaf is young raw still growing and full of energy  on stage they are passionate and fun to watch  in their songs they are honest and searching spiritual and hopeful  are you tired of bands who wallow in despair or rage  flyleaf goes to those places and then comes out on the other side  they show there is a way outmost of the songs on this album are worth repeat spins and two or three are exceptional  laceys voice is able to draw you in with fragile emotion then jar you to life with an unleashed scream  i love that in a female singerand its a rare trait  there is something here on this album for most rockers  i believe in the future well see more and even better things from flyleaf|1
the latest release from chickenfoot iii in my mind is their best effort yet good mix of blues rock and a couple slow groove tunes that are in constant rotation on my ipod get it|1
too obvious that this is a soundtrack background music only as a huge civil war buff i eagerly awaited burns series at the time of its introduction however i could never watch it for any length of time because id fall asleep now i remember why the music is soporific particularly ashokan farewell im still looking for a recording of civil war songs played and sung as they would have been at the time|0
i like classic rock and this is my favorite i have personally owned around 2000 albums of course i have listened to quite a few more i have listened to this album 2 cds lps and cassettes over 200 times yes over two hundred times i love this album just when i hear a contemporary album that sounds good soon after that i usually put this album on and it blows the others away it is a little dark and a little angry but well written played and recorded not much more to ask for|1
star trek iv is among one of the finest star trek movies of them all combining its quirky and somewhat memorable humourhowever trek movies usually provide topnotch scoresand sadly the voyage home falls flat on its back heresome scores for example the motion picture being as old a movie as it isthe score by goldsmith has not ages at all nor has horners the wrath of khan scorethe 1980s is ever present in stiv and while what sounds good in the movie it does not upon listening to it solomusic as heard in movie   music as heard on cd   |0
this collection of raffi songs is wonderful  every child needs to listen to raffi  his music is great and parents will enjoy it as well|1
for a part time band these guys really rock  really works without stepping all over each other  each album seems to get better the more they perform together  rock on dudes|1
this is a collection of fine old german songs cut in midverse sometimes like someone would switch stations on a pushbutton radio  ive heard all the song as a young man stationed in germany during the cold war and bring back memories  i wish the package was more honestly represented|0
there are no words to desrcibe the genius of this record no matter what i say about it i still would not be doing it justice everyone should own and expierence this album you cant just listen to it it wont let you  simply listen to it you expierence the mood and the feeling of the wall  take a trip through a true geniuss mind and buy the wall and if you can  handle it let me also recommend seeing the movie the only other rock  albums you can even compare the wall too are the other pink floyd albums  they are truely the greatest band ever|1
david gilmour and nick mason are the only credited members of pink floyd that appear on this album while rick wright is listed as a session musician  however pf without roger is the least of the problems with thisgilmour was a great frontman for the floyd in the early 1970s who contributed great classics like green is the colour the nile song the narrow way fat old sun and fearless  but on this album he completely caves in to the crappy musical style of the 80s  heavy on synthesizers female backup singers etcin fairness many great 1970s rock groups produced a lot of crap in the next decade as well  and it seems that even the pink floyd werent immune to thisi give this cd 2 stars because i dont see it as a complete failurethe song sorrow is kind of interesting and i could see it as a halfdecent song if it was recorded with that 1970s classic floyd sound|0
i highly admire the work of dr paul lam through tai chi but was extremely disappointed that the review says you can listen to a sample yet no samples are availablewould you be able to correct this error please|0
i have to agree with the other reviewer that this cd was not the best the songs were too slow especially psycho and rear window and really sounded fake there is also not just hitchcock music on here but there is music from other movies that lalo schifrin did  it was a very poorly put together cdthe only reason i kept this cd is because it contains most of the instrumental score from rear window which you cannot find anywhere else  if you want to hear the hitchcock music the way it sounds in the movies i recommend alfred hitchcock presents signatures in suspensethe bottom line is unless you want the score to rear window stay away from this cd|0
as another reviewer said the music in this album is very uncorrelated and the term dissonance quite succinctly and precisely sums up the musical efforts portrayed here  the film itself was moderately lowbudget and trying to cash in on the reawakening of the rings phenomenon occurring in the mid70s  ill leave discussion of the film for another reviewthis music is more ambience filler and mood setter in a substitutional manner where instead of the foley artist generated auditory effects for the scene we have the music masking over a lack of production values  the characters and their actions sound more or less the same from scene to scene with a few cursory effects thrown in for good measure  but the music dominates and in a terrible waystill if youre a tolkien or fantasy fan and have good fond memories of the film then this music should offer some pleasure by helping reconstruct the story for the listeneri personally have a hard time listening to the score all the way through and like another reviewer stated this actually does sound somewhat different from the score heard in the animated film although with no more or less lack of zeal as the score itself characterizes its own musicalityim glad i found it i have the original album and im glad to have it in my collection for the sake of having it but its not an outstanding score by any means whatsoeverif youre a fan of rare film scores then this might prove worth the purchase  but if you actually like film music and have a critical ear in the genre then you might want to pass this one up|0
at times reminiscent of the throwing muses more jagged moments with hints of prog pixies and a milder babes in toyland the album features sparse raw production with disconcerting tempo shifts and loudsoft dynamics the songs are genuinely creative and the lyrics  where decipherable  are intriguing but overall the album suffers from weak vocals unfocused songwriting and a lack of melodies the band improved with later albumsmay be of interest to fans of tsunami helium or early 90s mathrock slint rodan|0
this was one of the first realworld releases i listened to and is also one of my favorites  oryema has a smooth voice that covers a lot of emotion  this recording has a lot of traditional feel to it with the enhancement of peter gabriel and daniel lanois  makes it a little more atmospheric i guess  oryema makes the upbeat songs sound so joyous with the sad songs you can hear his sadness over the turmoil in his homeland  this is a great album to settle into and marinate with awhile|1
slash and myles kennedy are great together this is a must listen to anastasia and u will want this cd|1
finally a decent band with a female lead singer  so much better than evanescence  laceys voice is hauntingly beautiful|1
i listened to this whole album the other day because i read the reviews on amazon  this album is worthless  the only song i appreciated was while my  guitar gently weeps  later i realized why eric clapton helped out with  the guitar  that man has more talent in his pinky than all four beatles  combined  the beatles are the nsync of the 60s  i wish people would  realize this  nsync backstreet boys beatles  whats the difference|0
what a concept writing good songs too bad vh never got that memo before they churned our a different kind of turdchickenfoot got the memo there is killer music here which is not even debatable and satriani sounds just plain cool in most of the parts especially all these chunky keith richards riffs he seems to roll out then he whips into a lead like only satch can do very cool stuffmichael anthony is more out front on this disc and he should be again the vh record suffers without him this one benefits tremendously by having him on ithagars voice is still excellent and he still writes a decent melody unlike mumble with rocks in his mouthrothanyway bigfoot is awesome alright alright dubai blues is cool lighten up up next there is just some well written catchy music being played here by guys that are having fun together and it sounds like it one of the best things you can pick up this year if you want some good rock|1
i have been looking for this record in digital version for a long time  itunes and amazon both have the wrong tracks  it is incredible that neither one of them can get it right  especially since people have been stating it on the reviews for years|0
absolutely awesome  this cd is so awesome i dedicated a fan site to brian regan  honestly  i did  i cant get enough  ive listened to this cd over and over and shared it with friends  ive been to see brian regan at the improv over 15 times and brought friends  its a little nuts how impactful his comedy has been on meanyway if you have time you can see the fan site i built for brian regan at |1
another awesome album from some of the greatest musicians around sammy joe michael and steve are great together and make an awesome team i do think this album has a little more sammy in it then the first loved the way the first one came out too great songs and some with a good hard hitting message about the state of our nation at this time check it out|1
with all due respect to all you people who loved tso i think you should wake up and go straight to the nearest cd store and buy savatage albums and give it a listen because tsosavatage and basically the christmas evesarajevo song is basically a song on the dead winter dead album for savatage even back to a reason ii is the same back to a reason song sung by jon oliva in poets and madmen album for savatage so why does tso get the credit and savatage doesnt is this fair|0
ive had clockwork angels now for a week and if it were possible to wear out a cd my copy might need replacing soonlook im not a music critic and im not going to give an overblown analysis of clockwork angels track by track  its all so subjective anyway  what i cannot believe are the reviews that claim that rush is sloppy phoned this one in or that they have collectively or individually lost the ability or desire to play at the highest levels  all three charges and similar ones are patently and provably false so im left to conclude that those making them are trolls  its one thing to not care for the music but something else entirely to beclown yourself by making obviously false statementsim a long time rush fan who has bought every one of their studio albums since moving pictures as soon as i could get my hands on them  there have been a few disappointments im looking at you hold your fire and vapor trails over the years but even they have their gems  however ive always had to listen at least three or four times to the latest offering before i could get past the differentness and start appreciating what was there  to me this isnt a bug its a feature of rush its what makes being a rush fan a rewarding experience  its also what keeps rush relevant when other bands have long since lapsed into self parody or passed into the dustbin of historyclockwork angels is another stellar release from rush  standout tracks include caravan clockwork angels the anarchist carniesoh heck the only semiweak tracks imo are halo effect and bu2b2 and those are certainly listenable  if pressed i might pick headlong flight as my favorite but thats a really tough callif you have ever been a rush fan do yourself a favor pick up clockwork angels and give it at least four listens all the way through by the third time i think youll agree with me this is an outstanding album|1
they have the song list so screwed up its patheticmost of the songs are good though|1
first of all james horner is talented very talented that isbut titanic is so horribly overrated that it makes you cringe yes the title song is something special wait it was something special before it was played to death in the media james horner uses my heart will go on as the main theme of the score and thats about the only theme there is listen james when a score is this long one theme is just not enough at some points the score lacks musical tension like in an ocean of memoriesalso what bothers me like hell is the overuse of sythesized sounds a movie that big or at least made big screams for a deep orchestral sound i am a defender of the opinion that a sythesized choir always sounds terrible no matter how good it was mixed and horner uses it quite often in this scoreso whatever thousands of thirteen year old girls tell you this score isnt worth all the fuss and definitely not worth the academy award|0
my son loves raffi i did when i was a kid and now my son is hooked too he plays it almost all day and has almost all 3 discs memorized his music is easy listening fun silly and just all around awesome for kids |1
this is my favorite christmas album i have worn out at least 4 cds through the years i love giving it as a gift because the songs are so awesome i was first drawn to michael ws remake of angels we have heard on high titled gloria but the entire album is so full of praise michael w smith is such an awesome christian songwriter and performer love his work|1
slash myles kennedy what more do you need the best hard rock release of 2012 so far  however its strictly for the fans and wont convert anybody  good enough for me|1
i picked this c d up in the used bini put it on and my cat howled at the sound of the voice and keeled over dead enough writteni buried the c d with the cat|0
the number seven and eight wont play all the way through they lock up about half the way through i want to return them|0
im a fan of chanticleer  i like their ability to sing so many styles of music well  i like their musical savvy  this recording just struck me as a knockoff lets do some broadway hits and see how it turns  out  i have no real qualm with falsetto singing or countertenors i  generally like them if they are appropriate for the music  however the  sopranos of broadway are generally female and as such have a totally  different tone than a male falsetto or countertenor  the music that was  written for broadway whether for male or female voicerequires a tone  quality that is fuller and generally more gutsy than a falsetto  or countertenor can provide  i felt the pieces which should have heart and  soul were just insipidsorry guys but it did not work for me  i gave  this recording away  i would never consider doing that with any of my  other chanticleer recordings  the ensemble was up to its usual technical  form however|0
if you want to see the film about alhaji bai konte then look for pevar konte gambia this album is a must for anyone who loves music cares about the roots of jazz and blues and wants to hear the ultimate in african string music|1
as a retired teacher my own children and many of my students are now grown but we all still love raffi his six little ducks and going to the zoo both on the singable songs collection are favorites that still replay themselves in my mind often even though it must be 20 years since i first heard them this is not just kid music but good honest folk music a very pleasant relief from todays overly techno childrens pablum that is so common these tunes would be great for any parent or primary teacher who wants to add music and singing to a part of the day i have used them with the lyrics for a fun reading exercise give raffi a listen you gotta love him|1
lots of great reviews on this so ill be briefthis sounds like rush more so than any release ive heard from them in a long long time great to hear them sounding so familure if your a rush fan from way back youll dig this|1
ill admit it im not a big fan of the late beatles  i think they did theyre best work between the teenybopper early years and sgt pepperwhich is to say rubber soul and revolver  but a few months ago  i was in my brothers room and i said what the hey lets give the great  abbey road a chance  i listened to it twice and honestly i dont get  it come together is a pretty good song but the rest is slow  soulful balladiering slush its just plain boring  i can only listen to  paul sing like choir boy so long before i ache to hear george just pick up  his guitar and give us a blues lick  this is the greatest rock nroll  album of all time  hey folks if you want to hear the beatles play rock n  roll listen to hard days night  thats rock n roll  thisi dont know what this is|0
i bought this thinking it was a redo of the one so long ago  the one i remember only had four songs on it bear necessities trust in me the elephant march and i wanna be like you  bear necessities was an extra long song and trust in me was this nightclubbish jazz piece that was more provocative than done in the movie  basically it was the songs done in a serious manner  or an attempt to do them in a serious manner  the current soundtrack is good and rather informative but i felt cheated and that i had wasted ten bucks|0
meaning they hit all their notes right but have nothing to say in this bland spiritless runthrough of two of prokofievs most colorful works  this sounds like music made by computers or robots  moments that beg for color such as the coda of the first movement of the second sonata or the trio section of the scherzo of the same work are not present  the moody ominous opening strains of the first sonatahere it sounds like a finger exercise  this disc sounds like a halfhearted rehearsal  the sharp accents repetitive rhythms dynamic contasts elongated and asymmetrical lines not to mention that special russian or soviet i should say sardonicismall smoothed over here  someone added a lot of water to this ginand its not that the pair doesnt have technique  its more a matter that they dont have experience  i dont think they understand this music any more than a thousand monkeys at a thousand typewriters can understand the words of shakespeare even if they happen to type them  this trend of promoting younger and younger artists as the real deal in classical music is disturbing  there are a few with apparent wisdom beyond their years hillary hahn comes quickest to mind but plenty more withoutthe reviewer who was so impressed with this pianist should hear a feller named sviatoslav richter|0
i ordered this cd expecting to hear some songs from my favorite scenes but when i heard it all i was deeply disappointed not only was more than half of the movie missing the tracks were not even in chronological order i might as well list the movie moments that had music that arent on the soundtrack1 when stevie gets shotlorenz attacks the police in his apartment2 the girls talk about robbing a bank before they case the federal3 stony meets keith4 cleo triggers the car alarm5 the girls rob the balboa savings  loan6 the girls learn luther took their money7 cleo participates in a lineup8 the girls rob downtown federal the prerobbery the robbery the getaway9 frankie gets shot|0
i was a bit hesitant popping this in the car cd player since it isnt usually my type of music  but both my husband and i were enchanted by the old tunes and turned up the volume until it was being played for everyone on the road  the conjure toolbox just puts the icing on the cake|1
my children enjoyed raffi when they were young my daughter wants good music for her son and i thought of these i hope my grandson will have a much fun listening to these as my children and i did|1
i agree that the wall is a wonderful album  but yet it is not my favorite like that other guy said its hard to make a decision between this and dark side of the moon  but in the end i choose dark side  no offense but the wall is mainly the work of roger waters  yes he did drive the band to stardom and all that great stuff but you have to remember roger waters is not pink floyd so you be the judge  but let me remind you there is some really terrific music on this album  i would say it is definitely worth the money it is sold at  so go buy it  ps read my other floyd reviews|1
so i sprung for the new rush album clockwork angles i listened carefully to the entire cd as pronounced in a jewish stereo type voice while shrugging my shoulders and holding out my hands sideways mehbe ready for some of the sameolesameole as much as neil peart is amazing as always the songs are simply just mediocre at best im not looking for another pop song but clockwork angles provides nothing memorable nothing radio friendly nothing that will survive time no limelight or test for echos or red barchetta just song after song of meh with some special moments in a few songs although its a different concept album it follows in the footsteps of every other song they have done since presto the diehards will likely eat it up as always but the cd will probably collect dust in my over sized collection of music alex lifeson sounds exactly the same on guitar as he has always done on every single song he has ever played since his inception dont look for anything inventive by him here you would think with all the years of experience he may change the sound of his guitar and style of playing on at least one song butnope oh getty lee did discover using a volume horn while singing in certain parts of a song he must have learned that from jd on rock star inxsmore importantly the engineering of this cd is simply horrible clearly mixed for the ipod user nothing but over compressed mushy cymbals over screechy guitars and three note synth playing all in the same frequency range with absolutely no dynamicsdont get me wrong the cd has its moments but moments are far and few between the band hasnt been relevant in over 15 years and this cd is nothing more but the same old recycle material including expressions like machinery spirit synchronized mystery floatingthey seem to use these words like others use the and itnow wheres my porcupine tree cd|0
as usual rush comes through with yet another great musical compilation i have never been let down by the ever talented trio of canada i had waited what seemed like ages of anticipation for this newest album after hearing 2 songs from it at the red rocks denver time machine tour show of 2009 excellent as always|1
this book has so much in it  it makes me feel like im back in that time period again|1
wanted to have a cd that would encompass early to current i felt that the compilation picked mostly secondary hits songs not ones that jogged your memory of that particular musical felt the broadway the american musicals was far better in its selections i mean it went back to al jolson very disappoint in the greatest hits of broadway album|0
the bruckner fifth is an odd choice for ormandy who gives no evidence of being sympathetic to the composers style or even to understand it i believe there are some other stabs at bruckners symphonies by him but nothing induces me to seek them out given how stiff and unnatural this performance is ormandy had a reputation for splendid orchestral execution and bland interpretations here the philadelphians sound nowhere near as good as the berliners and the viennese and ormandy tends to punch out accents as if that alone will solve the tricky problems of tempo relationships and disjointed structure that make the fifth the most difficult of bruckners works to bring off successfully instead he walks straight through the scores sinuous curves and in the process delivers a wooden unthinking account even at bargain price this is a fifth to avoid|0
when this album was released the disagreements in creativity between floyds members seemed to be at its highest bassist roger waters seemed to exert more control over the creativity and as a result shut out many ideas from the other membersthe wall 1979 is a concept album based on a character named pink whose turbulent circumstances are loosely based around events in the lives of former floyd frontman syd barret eg nobody home etc and roger waters roger himself was particularly the one most affected by syd barretts mental decline and its effects can be heard throughout the albumthere are some rather conflicting thoughts regarding this album especially from guitaristvocalist david gilmour he has stated that creating the wall was a painful experience as well as stating that he thought overall the album came out good but it lacked the soul of earlier efforts while this indeed is a brilliant album i cant help but feel just as ambivalent as he does about the albumfirst off its been stated many times that this is largely a roger waters work and the unison of the band cannot be seen on this work there are no lovely ethereal reflective rick wright keyboard tracks or his vocals for that matter none of the masonwrightgilmour contributions  in short not much collectivity in general gilmour wrote roughly two or three tracks on the album but otherwise its mostly the product of waters and as a result its difficult to see this as a floyd album  in a collective sense of the word this may be the main reason why i considered this album strong lyrically but spotty inconsistent and dry on a musical level for many years i realize that anytime a concept album is present the lyrics are usually the focal point and basing a strong opinion on the music shouldnt mean much but unfortunately i have to enjoy both aspects of a concept album strongly for me to consider it an allaround classicover the years my opinions have changed and i enjoy the album much more than i did in the past of course comparisons between this album and floyds earlier albums should probably be avoided but are nearly inevitable since floyd has such a strongly dedicated following and has had so for many years perhaps if there had been no a saucerful of secrets 1968 no meddle 1971 no dark side of the moon 1973 or no wish you were here 1975 this album wouldnt draw so much controversy in both a positive and negative sense on a positive each of these albums didnt have the grandiosity in theme soundscape and didnt have the compelling theme of alienation that many of us humans can relate to with the exception of dsotm this along with most of the fairly accessible tracks i consider this album possibly the most mainstreamfriendly of these may have been the two main contributing factors of this albums overwhelming success however in the negative sense it would seem like a dryingup in creativity when listening to floyds albums in chronological order and this album being their culmination in creativity excluding the final cut its hard not to see floyd slipping quite a bit which is what ive basically witnessed in floyd ever since dsotm came along even though i enjoy each of the albums floyd made between dsotm and this album however as stated above if none of those earlier floyd albums were to exist this album would probably come the closest it can to being unanimous in its classic status not that it already hasntfrom the grandiose megalomaniacal david bowiemeetsqueenmeets film score hard rockmetal strains of the opening in the flesh to the maniacal orchestrated the trial this album is a journey through alienation depression frustration anger and many other dark areas of the human psyche its disturbing poignant and rewarding all at once enjoyalso recommended the wall the film and behind the wall a floyd documentary|1
i was given this album by my uncle in 1980 when i was in the 9th grade  at the time i was listening to country gasp music  needless to say i never looked back  in a time when vinyl was king i played the grooves off two copies  all hail the cd  rip syd barrett|1
slash along with myles kennedy and the conspirators have made an excellent album slashs guitar playing is exceptional and so are myles vocals my favorite track is anastasiacheck out the guitar workit is amazing|1
i listened to this music when i was little and thought my daugther would like it but she doesnt oh well still cute|1
the beatles are famous not for making great music but for being popular there is a difference  they may have made some great songs even on this album here comes the sun and come together but their filler was less than  bearable  rock and roll was all about the evolution of blues to a faster  beat  i hear little blues in the beatles songs in fact most of it  especially sgt peppers was experimental and a type of music that never  caught on  if one wants some good rock and roll try the rolling stones or  jimi hendrix who made the best blues rock and roll ever  abbey road has  some timeless classics and it is an injustice to say that the beatles were  not a good band but they were popular which in some peoples minds made  them great which they were not|0
this review is not like others explaining how pink floyd is the greatest and all others must kneel before them though they are my favorite band instead i bring up a point often overlooked in concern with the wall many fans claim this album is decent with only a few good songs and lots of filler the problem is that thats not filler the wall like many floyd albums is a concept album the entire album tells a story the story of an isolated sad dejected boy who grows up to be a rock star lives fast takes drugs comfortably numb and loses his wife one of my turns dont leave me now and bulids a wall around himself to keep from being hurt or feeling emotions hence the name the wall so while many songs sound like filler try listening to the whole album at once and see if you can understand the subplot or hey if you really want to go see the movie they made about it  aptly tiltled the wall|1
i was deceived into buying something that i did not want at an outrageous price i thought that i was ordering as the advertisement saysoriginal benny goodman trio and quartet sessionsvol 13 what i received was a single used cd for 2900 there is 1 trio piece and 1 quartet piece everything else is for big band with singers that is not what i was ordering and that was not advertised in the listing vol13 led me to think that i was getting 2 cds for 2900 i received 1 cd and it is used as stated i was deceived and paid a ridiculous price for 1 cd i am not at all happy amazon watch who you are dealing with as a sellertom greene|0
i am struck dumb to think his collection was given a fivestar rating the  very reason i bought it it is awful and i remember bob and ray as very droll radio comedians from the 50s the material collected herein is witless boring stupid decidedly unfunny repetitious often with poor sound quality and terrible music  a  complete waste of time and money after being burned by this purchase i am now leery  any fivestar rating may well be bogus this collection was so awful i fail to see how any bob and ray enthusiast could give this collection anything but a raspberry from here on out i am now suspicious of any glowing rating for anything  better to read the negatives is my new philosophy for amazon purchases|0
i now have all the history cds by the mcneils these include songs that have not been heard in a long while|1
i well remember how thrilled i was when rca finally decided to dip into the vaults and reissue some vintage sauterfinegan in the cd era i also remember how horrified i was at the simply ghastly audio quality all the more deplorable since the recordings by this band were stateoftheart high fidelity at the time of their original 19521956 release one track even utilizes a stretched tape i dont know if this was a case of the original master tapes deterioration of if rca used submasters that had been done for reissues at any rate you should avoid this cd like the plague and be happy that collectors choice did a bestof compilation with excellent sound quality|0
definitely not the best version of les mis available that would be the 10th anniversary concert eponine is truly awful the rest of the cast is ok if not the best possible at least theyre not the worst possible  lindsey stafford smith fantine is better than randy graff  john curl valjean is better than garry morris although he also seems to sing stars and is definitely not right for it  it sounds a lot like roger allam with him in confrontation adam pinter enjolras is no andy warlow or michael maguire but still stirring and powerful  christopher smith marius is also actually not bad although we dont get to hear empty chairs and empty tables  in fact there are a lot of great songs missing from this very short version i recommend saving up for one of the 2 or 3disc versions however if you dont pay too much for it you might get a pleasant if unremarkable hour of music|0
it has been well over a decade since my family bought this collection from tower records and i still listen to it from time to time  i even find myself humming the tunes as an adult  the songs are well chosen and performed  nancy cassidys voice is just right for these lullabies  there is nothing offensive or objectionable everything is pleasant catchy and soothing  even the accompanying songbook is a pleasure to look at  it always made me feel better as a child and i am sure it will do the same for your children  highly recommended|1
its not gnr its slash at his best cant wait for his next tour hope his next album is even better|1
i was so elated when i finally received wahoo by duke pearson that i just gloated and bragged for 3three days before playing it as it turned out the main cut amanda consisted of only four barssilent space where the rest of the tune would be then the rest of the lp which played fine guess i gotta keep searchin huh amanda kenneth|0
very disappointed  at least half of songs did not come through completely  typically heard instruments but not words not what i expected|0
this cd really is terrible i bought their second album vegas car chasers and i really enjoyed it it was genuinely good had a really unique sound so i figured maybe their first album was as goodthey sound like a local ska band and nothing is special about it unless you enjoy crappy ska music or you like songs just cause they have funny lyrics meaning they dont actually have to sound good this is the cd for you if you enjoy a cd where they sound like a real band and not like everyone else pick up vegas car chasers|0
the main question you have to ask when buying a cd of a legend such as carlos gardel is what kind of an engineering job was done on transferring the 78rpm recordings  in many ways this cd has the best sound of any carlos gardel ive heard  but it seems to have a fatal flaw of many digital restorations from this period  a flanger distortion of the high frequencies that sounds like you are cupping your ear now and then  something in the music actuates the flange when it occurs  a shame|0
would you expect anything less than perfect from the best rock band ever  one of their best albums ever congrats to rush  rock hall 2013 inductees|1
the case was for rubber soul the cd inside was disc 2 of some random beatles compilation not pleased at all|0
this book is a top notch reference guide to the 80s and early 90s rock scene in los angeles california the amount of research that was done here is very impressive theres a section of the book dedicated to each of the main sunset strip clubs as well as a few clubs that were off the strip such as the troubador and the country club excellent photos as well highly recommended if youre an 80s hard rock fan like i am|1
even taking into account a few moments of incoherence the wall definitely qualifies as a masterpiece of not only its genre but recorded albums in general  the incoherence is this really a flaw or is it essential to the story  a magnificent job is done of really taking listeners into the mind of the tortured soul  that there are pieces that stand alone as great only adds to the brilliance of this album  i dont know what to say to anyone who doesnt get it except that i appreciate the wall a hell of a lot more than i did when i was a teenager|1
i was about 16 when this album was released it became an anthem for me and my friends  the album and then the film transformed our lives and we didnt even know it at the time  all we really knew is that it was very very good and we knew then even as teens that it was a masterpiece  the last great collaboration by the four remaining members postbarrett  the wall wasnt meant to be radiofriendly however the decaying aor stations made many of the individual songs radiofriendly by means of minimal editing  anyone who knows this work can tell you that any one song taken from the album can stand alone but the original color is lost if not consumed as a whole with all the parts intactno need to go onandon about this cornerstone of modern pop music just give it a listen judge for yourself|1
i was looking for a cd that featured not only traditionalmaori songs but also traditional maori instuments  this cd has the songs but the music is played by an electric guitar combo no poi balls |0
as a father of two i try to find educational music with a good beat and ill enjoy too  i couldnt find anything like that until i found crazy curt and the fireballs kidz go crazy my kids really did go crazy when they heard it dont get me wrong this cd is good but i would recomend going with crazy curt|0
it is hard to tell you how good this album isand if you dont know anything about it you have been deprived for too longroger waters is the best writer of all timehis first great album was darkside of the moonand then every album he has written in pink floyd and solo is great alsobut the wall and darkside are the at the top of greatnessif you have never heard any of the music from this album then see a doctor and buy this album and listen to the whole thing straight through many many many timesyou will love itand if you dont then you probably are incapable of liking any good music|1
never never download using amazon could player cant download to itunes going to purchase the cd wont do this again|0
my father loves  it is helping to keep his cancer from spreading  this is one of five cd i purchased for my dad  he enjoys listening to them and they seem to make a big difference in his treatment|1
this is not a cd for bud freeman fans or even tradtional jazz fans these recordings are merely popular numbers recorded for the  public and you can hardly hear freemans sax the five demarco sisters sing on some of these  i want my money back|0
song is fantastic and moving unfortunately i bought 5 of these 45s hoping one would not be warped or have snaps frizz or pops during the music i can only use one of these for a relatively distortion free transfer to cassette and even that one will take lightning cueing speed to avoid sound distortions seems like most apple vinyl that are not 180 grams are always warped or contain unacceptable distortion of some kind snap crackle pop wow and flutter capital emi and parlaphone had much better records warp and noise wise especially capitals purple label beatle releases but only apple sells this song on vinyl|0
rush doing some of the best performances in their careers on this oneif ur a fan dont pass it up|1
the thornbirds is one of my favorite novels and though i liked the movie richard chamberlain mainly i couldnt have been more upset with this movie  its reaching pure and simple  it goes against whole concepts in the book such as luke coming back  the entire point of luke was that he was a dead beat couldnt have cared less and certainly wouldnt have gone so far as to try to get custody  he loved nothing more than himself and the money he made he was more than happy to let meghann have the children he never wanted in the first place and only begat due to his hormones above and beyond all the inaccuracies and reachings another maggie  are you kiddingits just plain rubbish and quite frankly it sullies my love of this epic and adored saga|0
this is by far my favorite pink floyd album this album is more rock than psychadelic like dark side but it still has pink floyds old style with it toojust more harderand its definatly not overrated like some people sayroger waters is a genius|1
if youre expecting earthchanging life defining soul searching restrospectiveetc forget about it this cd like their debut is nothing more than a collection of songs by people who are having a great time making music throw in the extra fun of a 3d experience and you have it allits entertainingits rock n rolland i like it|1
the cd rembetissa by singer roza eskenazi is the real greek blues performed by one of the greatest jewish singers|1
this version of the carl orff masterpiece cruises along acceptably until the tenor solo  i had to take the cd out of the player to see if there was something wrong with it  its just painful to listen to  instead of this version i would suggest either the leonard slatkinst louis symphony or the more recent version with christian thielemannduetsche oper berlin  both treat the piece with the wild abandon and exitement it deserves and more importantly all the soloists give fine performances in both versions|0
ellis is one the countries finest contemporary folk artists of today  carnival of voices once again brings us into the lives of common everyday people that ellis brings to life with his lyrics  paris in a day is a wonderful singalong and the deepness of weightless brought me to tears|1
the big draw on this disc is john krances arrangement for wind band of a 27 minute suite of music from carl orffs carmina burana a version that is instrumental only and without chorus its not the only time thats been done but as rendered by the peabody conservatory wind ensemble under harlan parker this recording is an enjoyable experience filling out the release are two pieces by arthur bird and herbert owen reed bird an american whose dates are 18561923 won the paderewski prize in 1901 for his serenade for wind instruments herbert owen reed born in the us in 1910 and still alive as i write this offers his la fiesta mexicana which depicts a religious festival both of these works are okay in my estimation but i couldnt get terribly enthused about either one to be honest though the playing is once again quite excellent at the time of this review the disc is no longer available through amazon though copies can be had at arkivmusiccom at the bargain naxos price its worth it to get a wellplayed carminawithoutwords and who knows you might cotton on to the other pair of works better than i this is worth a listen|1
as most rush albums for me it takes some listening to before i become a believer when i first listened to this album i felt like this may be a bad album i love rush so much that i really get dissapointed when for even a moment im not feeling their work at all but then it happens i force myself to keep listening and low and behold it becomes clear almost like a miracle this album went from a great dissapointment to my favorite album since signals this album in my opinion is in the top five of all rush albums rush is so dynamic that you cant even compare some albums to the others like their first six albums can be compared amongst each other but not to the rest of their work you cant compare caress of steel to power windowstwo totally different albums yet each album is a five star album clockwork angels is a five star album like vapor trailspower windowssignalspermanent waves different from five star albums like hemispheres  a farewell to kings fly by night 2112 this album after you keep listening and listening reading along with the lyrics will prove itself of greatness in my opinion if you have a 12song album 7 of those songs need to be great in order for the album to be a five star album the great songs are bu2bclockwork angelscarniesthe anarchistseven cities of goldthe wreckers wish them well and the garden which is a top twenty all time rush song maybe top ten manthats eight great songs the other four are very good songs as well not one weak song i love this album i havent been as excited since moving pictures|1
my little girl absolutely loves himthis 3 pack of cds is great the only drawback is baby baluga is not on any of them|1
this is coming from a person that didnt believe that mediation helped anyone i was given this tape from a friend and it took me a week before i even opened it from the very first time i listened to it i was like wow i have lived with anxiety and panics for 20 years and now anytime i need to just calm my mind and be in total relaxation i do the 10 min part of the cd it is truly amazing how it helps me be relaxed confident and in total peace i have been truly blessed by the cd and by the friend that introduced it to me this is one of the greatest life changing gifts i have ever received|1
brian regan is simply a comedic genius  this cd is especially funny after having seen him liveyou can just picture his hilarious gestures and facial expressions  he has managed to create a hysterical routine based on the silly stuff weve all saiddonethought  while i too enjoy comedians who are more cutting edge i dont think a routine has to be peppered with profanity to be funny  this cd is well worth any price check out his dvd and his live show too|1
dont go near this its a thirdrate recording of a fifth rate radio show orchestrations are soupy badly played and terribly mixed  often drowning out the singers its all talk  good but dated talk with jenny sandwiched in if youre expecting to hear show tunes with broadway zip and sparkle  then this aint for you|0
the sudden passion did a great job with this one the lyrics are witty with just the right amount of twang  this is a whiskeysoaked indie rock jam that captures the soul of modern americana|1
im sure that most 5 starts reviews here are from diehard rush fans that would have given 5 starts to any album labeled rush even if it had has sound of their farts i had to be skeptical to them and read low rating reviews first before buying this albumwhere rush found that brilliant sound producer did they listen to the complete result or they became deafquieter moments are passable but as soon as the guys start play heavy metal it turns to the wall of noise drums sound like they were recorded inside of a barrel cymbals almost absent in the record bass guitar parts cannot be heardany garage band that has apple laptop can make better sounding record now this is shame for such a respectful and wealthy band as rush to release music with so terrible sound quality you guys couldnt find or afford better producerim not very picky in the sound quality department but if i cannot hear the music how do i like or dislike iti gave it 2 starts for a couple of quieter songs i could listen and for the brilliant cover and insert designs and naturally for neils lyrics|0
pink floyd the wall pretentious overblown and full of its self yes but is it a good listen and the answer is yes its rich and as it is meant to do take you the listener on a journey into one characters diminishing lunacy the songs are excellent and twenty years after i first listened to this the songs still linger|1
rush what can you say i was extremely excited to see they were making new music  then i listened to it and i was extremely dissapointed  every song sounded the same there was no differentiation  between songs|0
the playlist for this cassette lists 11 songs the tape i received contained only 7 songs and was only about 15 minutes in length i ordered the cassette because it had one song on it i was having trouble finding anywhere else guess which song was not among the 7 on the tape i spent 15 for nothing i could have purchased a good cd for less than that what a rip off|0
the wall is amongst the greatest rock music albums ever madeit contains some of the greatest songs in comfortably numb and another brick in the wallvery highly recommendeda must have|1
i heard this rach 2 on public radio today and was awestruck  i waited for twenty minutes in my driveway to hear who could possibly posses this clumsy sense of rhythm this ability to make even the most graceful transitions sound forced this manor of hammering awkwardly at the most beautiful lefthand runs ever composed and a total  and i mean complete and utter  lack of dramatic sensibility  the local npr station sometimes plays recordings of the local community orchestra perhaps the noname soloist from last season no i would have remembered a performance as bad as thisi suppose only big artists like kissin and gergiev have the wherewithal to partition such a rhapsodic work into such disconnected episodes|0
i have to agree with randolph wagner this cd gets 5 stars for the choral pieces minus 3 stars for the recording quality it sounds like the recording was transferred from an 8track tape this cd should have been sent back and remastered if you have other shaw cds you can hear for yourself the difference this is not a quality recording why did they let this slip out the door|0
giovanni martinelli was supposed to have been the best manrico the samples on this cd support this conclusion unfortunately this cd is filled with many wholes where the music just fades away for seconds the overall result is anger with pearl not to have fixed this problem or at least warned about reiner kollrack|0
this cd rocks but i knew this was going to happenon a side note be sure to watch the song inspiration on the web which explains their process behind every song it really provides insight on the album there isnt a bad song here something gone wrong is my favorite it is an acoustic 12 string piece good lyrics and a classic joe guitar bridge with overall tempo which i prefer i do like the lyrical message on three and half letters i need a job i cant wait until chickenfoot 2  or chickenfoot 6|1
giving it one star because i cant stand the band  bought it for my son for christmas  he didnt inherit my great taste in music  too bad for anyone driving anywhere near his car when they have to listen to this nonsense|0
while not quite as bad as some of the stinkers which were to follow this is another terrible effort by the socalled fab four yesterday is instantly forgettable dizzy miss lizzy sounds like it could have been written in the 50s and ticket to ride is an insult to my ears quite frankly as usual i did enjoy ringos excellent drumming and i liked the song act naturally for shame|0
ive been listening to this for about a week and 12 on about the 4th listeningtrying really hard to like it just cant do it some tracks i cant even make it all the way throughi logged on just to see what others were saying about this album saw nothing but good reviews and i was like whatim a huge fan of satch since surfing with the alien and sammy since early 80sthis band has so much talent i just cant believe cant do a better album than this i was a bit disappointed in the first one but it had a few stand out tracks ie get it up learning to fall but this one i just cant get into maybe im the only one|0
i see here that some people are led to believe this is real vangelis while its not that said as a vangelis fan and notsofan of cover versions that add little or nothing to the original music i have to say that ive heard better ones but again why buying an expensive cover versions album while you can get the original vangelis por much less people get compilation albums like themes  portraits or odyssey and you will get the fresh and unparalleled vangelis in full splendour and cheaper|0
i want to like this album but the sound is muddy and hard to listen to another casualty of the loudness wars|0
when i saw this as being availablecouldnt wait to get my hands on it once i listened to itcompletely let down where are the original versions of iou  i want it to be real thats what i rememberthats what i have on vinyl being a part time dj using only cdsi wanted this as part of my collection turns out the remixes do not have the energy that the originals do the review did not say the original versions were not on it i love a good remix as much as the next personbut the original is what i remeber mixingand what was heard on the radio when it hit sorry johnyif you are going to make a greatest hitskeep it originali played this for other friends  djs and they were also disappointed|0
after listening to this album i can understand now why take that never broke into the american market not funky enough to dance to not soulful  enough to fall in love to take that represents the blandest of elevator  music|0
i have the original cast recording from 66 on vinyleven with all the scratches its easier to listen to than this the offbway show ran foreverthis one would have been lucky to make it a week|0
these quintets are among the most sublime creations that i know of nothing of that beauty is captured however in these recordings the sound and performances are cold harsh mechanical and rushed  exactly the opposite of what these pieces requirei would reccommend the exquisite recordings by the grumiaux ensemble and that of the talich quartetbut it would almost be worth the price of this album to also buy this one so that you could truly appreciate what grumiaux and talich have to offer|0
great bass playerbut lacks identityfirst couple of tracks sound like zawinul solo stufftoo much drum machinecakewalk sequencing that makes it sound sterilebest track is leap a great jam with andy narrel steel drummerniceabout 50 50 split of some very good and others just mediocre|0
i carefully went through the posted reviews before i bought this thinking i would give this cast the benefit of the doubt but honestly its not worth your time trouble or money none of the cast gives a reading even close to the original bway casts i am not wedded to the original cast  neil patrick harris patti lupone et al did a wonderful job with the new york philharmonic a couple years back  i wish somebody would release that recording on cd  but roundabout theatre companys version is washedout at best dont bother|0
i bought this recording based upon another amazon review that was very misleading theres none of the zimmer magic ive since read that almost all of the score was actually penned by gregsonwilliams    and i believe it|0
some of songs skip received no ring took a bit to get here flyleaf packaging was good does play nice besides the few skips i may consider ordering from there again|0
this critique is of the pressing quality control the recording sounds fantastic easily superior to a cnet half speed mastered copy i have the down side is rti they can take a fabulous master and screw it up from scuffs on new vinyl to bubbled and lifting labels i swear do they just ship everything they press does anyone look at the vinyl any time i see the rti pink vinyl sleeve i cringe and expect to find some manufacturing defect they are 6040 return rate in my experienceoh well thanks to amazon i can get another copy|0
yup the first cd is not what is listed on the website which is too bad because some of those songs are great especially schone maid and amboss polka they rock im keeping the cd because they were gonna charge me for the shipping so the heck with it i now have some more background music for working in my shop or at my own little bier fests|0
yawwwwwwwwn i think ill go watch paint dry instead or water boil either one is preferable than going stark raving mad listening to this dreck|0
getting ready for a trip i felt like i had too much to do and too little time to do it in and was afraid i wasnt going to get everything done but i took the time to listen to cloaked in joy by jane simington the night before i left after listening to the cd i felt so much more relaxed and even the next day i felt more peaceful packing and driving to the airport the cd lives up to its name since by releasing my pretrip stress and my fear that i wasnt going to get everything done in time i felt more joyful|1
thought was only going to get 1 or 2 extra songs that i would like on the album  turns out i was wrong  the entire album is awesome|1
as much as i love chickenfoot i must say that the vinyl version of this album sound terrible very loud hiss unlike any other lp i own i own hundreds old and new it really is too bad i love that the band is supporting the vinyl revival but this particular edition fails miserably in the sound department|0
i must say that i was happy to purchase this cd after listening to it on rhapsody and finding that i liked about half the songs on first listen i have been listening to it pretty much constantly since and find the entire cd is actually very very goodpros rock solid instrumental work slashs guitar is on fire great rock sound like you dont hear much anymore which can best be described as virtual energy emanating from the speakerscons the vocals on a few of the songs have to grow on you is the best way to describe it think of it like old gnr or bruce dickinson remember that first time you heard eitherand thought what the well that describes some of the vocals on this cd in that they are unexpected that said though the more i listen the more i likeif there are rock gods up there we will hear this a lot on the radio this summer|1
the wall is as good as music can getrush to your record store and bring it todayone word yesrecommendedfive stars|1
for the life of me i cannot understand why gardiner is the darling of critics making recordings like this people are comparing hogwood to gardiner frequently here and to my senses there is no comparison because gardiners eroica is simply tasteless and way out of bounds the tempo of the first movement is so fast it barely makes sense at all many times parts which should be in the background are firmly in the foreground and it sounds bizarre but im not sure thats the mixing or the orchestra not that it really matters hogwoods is every bit as energetic and intense but hogwoods sense of phrasing timing choice of tempo orchestral balance hell everything  is impeccable hogwoods eroica from 83 or so is one of the greatest in recording history if not the greatest  this is just an experiment|0
im so happy with this new cd from rush is really good music the deliver timing was fine and the cd is new as in a store|1

this is arguably floyds greatest work and is truly a legendary album  rumour has it that roger waters showed this work and the pros and cons of hitchhiking to the boys in floyd at the same time and the floyd members decided to do this one smart move  its an immensely complex work which was probably lost on many who just loved the lyrics of another brick in the wall part 2  its one of rocks most ambitious albums and waters and the band should be congratulated for that  this is pretty much waterss creation with a few credits given to gilmour and one to the producer bob ezrin  many people have trashed waters as an egomaniac but he is a great lyricistsongwriter  his lyrics and songs are vastly superior to gilmours and he came up with the great concepts for all of floyds classic albums  however gilmour mason and wright did contribute greatly to the floyd sound  they may not have gotten credit all the time but pink floyd really interpreted waterss work very well  waterss solo albums arent as good as his floyd work and this may have something to do with it  the tour for this album was one of the most elaborate in rock history  gilmour mason and waters didnt get paid for their work here because they felt it was more important to put the show on in their original concept  ironically richard wright who was fired or left the group during the sessions for the wall was hired as a contract musician for the tour and ended up being the only one of the group who made any money off the tour  this was probably floyds last great album even though the final cut is brilliant in its own right and momentary has its moments i dont have the division bell  there are many great songs here much of them better than another brick in the wall part 2 mother in the flesh i and ii waiting for the worms goodbye blue sky one of my turns  it isnt a happy album despite success waterss songs got even darker as the years went on but its absolutely essential|1
if youre looking for rousing irish bagpipe music this aint it  its more your average irish reel band music  dont care for it|0
this is 7 in the 7cd series televisions greatest hits the original and most complete compilation of tv theme songs  i have 5 of the 7 so far 1 2 3 6 and now 7 i bought 1 as a 2lp set back in the day each album usually contains songs from 65 tv shows from a specific era as usual there is a mix of authentic recordings from the tv shows and some reproductions  i hate it when they do a reproduction this albums songs come mostly from the late 80s and 90s the end of the line for tv theme songs in general my reason for the low rating 1 the music isnt that memorable unless you have nostalgic feelings a lot of these are kinda boring  i had stopped watching sitcoms by the 90s so not much nostalgia for me in contrast i enjoy a lot of the songs from the 50s and 60s even if i had never ever heard of the shows 2 too many of them seem like reproductions best part if you get the original packaging the plastic case is holographic the words televisions greatest hits cable ready appeardisappear as you rotate the case|0
wow  rush  still rockin after all these years  what an incredibly talented trio of musicians  this album shows that theyve still got it|1
if you want to put a cd in your car and laugh and laugh and laugh some more then brian regans live cd is what you need i saw him years ago on hbo and i laughed until i cried i have this cd and his routines his voice and his ability to take the mundane and make it hilarious is pure genius the cd starts off with his take on saying the words you too in conversations and then using it accidentally when someone says something to youits a family friendly cd a couple of hell words but nothing else and when you are down this cd will perk you up and you will laugh despite having heard these skits which range from your school science fair projects playing right field in little league and people who cant buy donutsbuy this cd its some of the best comedy you will ever enjoy|1
im a big john cafferty fan  i saw them live back in 1984 at the height of their fame and was bowled over  it was easily one of the best concerts that ive ever attended  that said this album really leaves me cold as did the entire eddie ii saga  a lukewarm movie and a stillborn soundtrack  how many times have you seen this recipe  its tough to live through one lightning strike  why tempt another|0
in my 10000 system it will not play why i dont know its a real shame but thats how it is|0
cd ended up being scratched and only partially played ended up going to the store and buying a different set for nearly the same price|0
we are a homeschooling family studying american history my kids listened to this cd over and over  what a great way to learn about history the authors do a great job of including the meaning and contexts of the numerous songs in this collection i highly recommend this collection for anyone looking to make history more than simply reading a textbook|1
yes the orchestral playing is quite impressive yes bernstein truly demonstrates his love for this music through this performance yes butafter listening to both works it was like walking onto a train at rush hour expecting the express train yet finding out later to my dismay that it is really a local trainthis is mozart you need more thrust or spontaneity or whatever you want to call it bernteins tempi are too stilted for me especially the beginning of no 40 although he went a little overboard in his diatribe i believe eln was correct in explaining the complete disappearance of emotion and urgency from the first movement of no40 because of its slow pace 8 34 minutessorry all the plusses i mentioned above just pale compared to the unnecessary plodding of some of this cds movementsthis cd just doesnt cut it especially with the huge competition out there re these two symphonies|0
this cd was not worth all the money i paid for it  hampton could have left funkasson out of the title  i was expecting to hear something that sounded at least as good as axiom funk or some of eddies material  i felt like i was robbed  i also lightened my comments in respect of amazons review guidelines|0
raffi still is the most joyous and intelligent musician for very young children he doesnt patronize them with boring tunes but produces music in many genres that stimulates and develops a love for music at the same time he can be goofy and silly in all the ways that little kids lovebut never in that gooey way that makes adults want to run the other way thanks raffi|1
it seems that all of the negative comments are from supposed fans who simply want the same old writing and songs as they already have any band of quality will stretch out a bit in their style and writing and that is exactly what rush has done here and its fresh original and sounds incrediblethe more i listen to this the more i like it that the sign of good writing the material that i like most today all took a while before they impressed me|1
really really good jazzfunk i heard them at the sf jazz fest and picked up the debut cd definitely worth it you can listen to their albums on the bands myspace page worth the buy though|1
there are a few good pieces worth owning but overall the soundtrack is just flat and unmemorable in every aspect many have argued that the music works for the filmand they may be right but sadly the music cannot stand alone it falls apart quickly as uninspired and boring i cant even sit through most of the album anymore it just doesnt go anywhere or capture my imagination as much as it pains me to say it about a star trek moviethis is one that may not have warranted a soundtrack release its filed in my collection for the sake of completion i pulled this disc out earlier this evening realizing i hadnt listened to it in ten years it only took me two minutes to remember why that was and it will be going back in the vault until ive forgotten why i dont listen to it again|0
clockwork angels is one of the finest albums from rush after snakes and arrowsthis album is really good and one of their best after counterparts vapor trails and snakes and arrowseach and every song on this cd is a classic and this album is very highly recommended|1
i like the beatles but im not one who likes everything they did just because they were the beatles  i think at this point they were riding on their past reputationi always liked the album cover on abby rd but was very surprised at the lack of good material on the album when i sampled it for the first time tonight  i would rate this album a notch below the white album which had a few good songs but mostly just weird no catchy tunes and has a depressed or down trodden feelingi would say to stick with earlier material or go to a site like youtube where you can  sample the songs first  there are only a couple songs worth having on this album in which case id say to buy a greatest hits or buy songs individually  for some reason amazon doesnt let you buy mp3s by the beatlesno offense to beatles die hard fans that consume everything they did but quite honestly from an objective point of view they were no longer walking on water at this point in thier career|0
a true classic of american musictoo bad this never came out on cd or digitali have enjoyed this album since it came out in the 70s|1
where to start  producer jackie mills must give an account for this cd disaster  first of all the potential purchaser would be unaware that this cd is incomplete  its missing a key track scout and boo which was present on the original ava album  secondly as one listens to the cd the sound becomes progressively worse  particularly after track 4  obviously the tapes were not preserved very well but there is no mention of this of this in the cd notes thirdly most if not all the tracks are in mono not stereo  the original ava lp was certainly available in full stereo so why were those tapes not used  why was the buyer not informed that they were purchasing a mostly mono cd even more frustrating is the fact the cd is filledout with inconsequential music whilst the previouslymentioned key track is absent   allinall an extremely disappointing cd presentation of the original soundtrack album on cd which features one of the most beautifullywritten film scores of the 20th century|0
first of all the best thing about brian regan is the clean language  he doesnt need to shock you to be funny and our whole family kids included can safely listen to him  secondly he makes you laugh so hard you cry  his material is about everyday things looked at in an unusual way  third if you ever get the chance to see him perform his facial and body expressions make him even more hilarious  i highly recommend brian regan to anyone and everyone|1
though this lady has a beautiful voice it cannot make up for songs that do not do her justice  this album is quite fun but a little repetative in its theme and in my view there are only a couple of good songs  very poppy and of its time but now quite dated|0
the most obvious problem with the score to terminator 2 is that it is redundant  it consists of loud metallic clangs and late 80searly 90s synthezized noises and thats about it  it is without strings percussion or any real noticeable brass instruments  scores can be done well with this sort of style see the thrilling speed score but this one is just boring  it doesnt lend excitement or thrills to the actionall it does is give off a sense of menace about the machines  but the ultimate question is wether or not it serves the movie  well i definately think that if the music had more personality the movies action sequences would have been even more thrilling but thats just me  overall this cd is not worth a purchase by any means|0
first you can never replace the original cast amanda donohoe did not even come close to portraying meggie cleary as we have come to know her in the original series this movie takes a very deviant path from the original series first they didnt mesh the scenes from the original meggie comes down in her ash of rose dress meggie is wearing her hair down in this movie her hair is upplease im not even a movie critic or director but pointed that out with no problems 2nd fey is totally spirited and alive making her opinions known and being cheerful and warm in this movie and we all know that in the original she was a complete pill totally removed from meggie and anyone elseso why change it who knows ralph chamberlain was the only true character in both series as for the children dane having red hair in the missing years then off to black hair in the originaldont think so as for the children or adult children in the original they didnt even know who ralph was remember as they were at the watering hole and jussie was doing an act with dane they had no clue as to who ralph was when he came upon them but in this series they got to know him quite wellagain i think they really should have taken the time to be true to the original series its a shame that rachel ward didnt come back to do meggie it just wasnt the same feelingmore awkward and too mechanical when it came to donohoes performance of meggie i only got this dvd cause it came in the package with the original seriesill stick with the original because its simply the best i had to forward many parts in the missing years since i couldnt bear the bad actingexcept the parts with ralph and even then some were a bore i give chamberlain a for his acting and trying to salvage the movie he of course was the only reason i watched the dvdnow it will just sit collecting dust as i rewatch the original series over and over again|0
i bought this cd because they play im so sick in live free or die hard my other favorite song is cassie if you like christian hard rock youll love flyleaf|1
i love the qualityof the cd and the music is great this cd is a must buy  i love my puerto rican roots andthis cd sure brings that out|1
a guns fan but really just appetite and then some sporadic songs here and there loved velevet revoler too  also really liked the first two alter bridge albums and liked kennedys voice a lot more than stappthis album has real teeth check out the two singles standing in the sun 3 and anastasia 8 and i really like no more heroes 5 if these dont get you going this isnt the album for youdont let anybody tell you there isnt any good rock and roll out there|1
i know who let him conduct it those greedy dg music executives thats who hoping to make a quick killing with the release of this sludge of a performance the fall of the berlin wall was an event of great significance and to commemorate the occasion dg gets the most famous living conductor in the world to conduct one of the greatest and most famous works of music in history beethovens 9th symphony they even changed the word joy to the word freedom in the finale this had the makings of something truly special but unfortunately it falls short of even the most mediocre expectationsherbert von karajan died not too long before the berlin wall fell and if he was still alive it would undoubtedly be karajan conducting on this recording not bernstein karajan became an old man physically in his final years but his musicmaking never surrendered to his age karajans last decade of performances was just as vigorous and intense as in the good old days bernstein on the other hand really did become an old man physically and musically his tempos became messy and lethargic everything was elongated ponderous and many times vapid dont think im wanting in respect to bernstein i think he was great when he was young never on the level of toscanini furtwangler karajan but great nonetheless even in his final years lenny could turn out a gem like shostakovichs leningrad symphony with the chicago symphony orchestra but more and more bernstein became the hack the slow painful hack listen to the infamous tchaikovsky 6th from the final bernstein years its a jokereturning to this beethoven 9th it is just as much of a joke as that tchaikovsky 6th the first movement is nearly 18 minutes long limp and slow without any of the apocalyptic climaxes that you have to deliver if youre going to take such a spacious tempo the scherzo is better one short repeat is skipped and the movement is palatable the adagio is awful 20 minutes long and without any spiritual tension at all furtwanglers famous wartime 9th also has a 20 minute adagio but it is phrased and sculpted so beautifully with such inner intensity that it overwhelms you and tears are not uncommon upon hearing its magnificence bernstein on the other hand puts you to sleep its nap timethe finale can bernstein pull it off did he ever this might come as a shock to some but as great a conductor as bernstein was he never recorded a great version of the 9th symphony i repeat never not with the nypo not in vienna and certainly not here in berlin with this hastily put together concoction of musicians from various orchestras bernstein could succeed with the initial three movements back in ny and in vienna with the vpo but the finale always eluded him he schmaltzed it up every up he made it disjointed episodic and nearly incoherent as on this ode to freedom cd it becomes not joy not freedom but instead a hapless lethargic mess the whole thing seems like a funeral and proceeds for nearly 29 minutes karl bohms final digital version on dg was also that slow but felt somewhat more alive what with the great orchestra and chorus bernstein doesnt even have thatplease whatever you do dont listen to this nightmare and conclude that this is beethovens 9th its not if you want to hear the 9th there is furtwangler karajan toscanini solti wand whomever but not this bernstein its possibly the worst ever im not exaggerating its just as egregious as roger norringtons infamous london classical players recording except for totally different reasons norrington is the worst of the periodinstrument fast paced clipped readings and this bernstein is the worst of the traditional big orchestra versionsif you just love bernstein and want to hear him in beethovens 9th symphony go buy his earlier versions one from the late 1970s with the vienna philharmonic and one with the new york philharmonic from the 1960s those versions are average but even average is far superior to this epic mess called ode to freedom please free yourself from this recording its only good as a bad joke|0
i remember being 13 years old unwrapping my moving pictures cassette and putting it into my walkman  track 4 anarchist immediately returned me to the early 80sthese guys are in their early 60s and belting out some of their best bass and drum driven material evergeddys vocals on track 5 carnies not quite the shrill caress of steel stuff it is a throwback from his vocals pastheadlong flight anarchist caravan and possibly bu2b would have all been in heavy rotation on aor radioyeah headlong flight is a ripoff of bastille day totally rehashed it and made it a lot of fun great trackgreat disc strongly reccomend it for all who havent indulged in rush since presto counterparts etc  cant wait to see rush on the road this fall|1
this is not a very good cd worth buying it is worth buying for 10 or 15 dollors but not too expensive if you are a weird al yankovic fan this is a good rare item al plays accordian in some songs and one of the first things in his work|0
this is a very short cd  obviously recorded at a club  the audio quality is not very good that could be forgiven if the cd were packed with several live shows  excerpts from two shows is not enoughadditionally there is no information booklet so i have no idea where and when these sets were recordedlook for a better collection of rustys remarkable performances|0
this soundtrack is pretty bad it really pales in comparison to the batman forver soundtrack i gave this two stars solely for the two really good songs on it the bug by soul coughing and moaner by underworld im a fan of rem and smashing pumpkins but i just really dont like their songs on here the bone thugsnharmony song is really good but edited on this cd blechso overall if you can find it for really cheap you might want to pick it up but it really only has a couple good songs|0
i really liked the song somewhere in the night ever since i saw the episode where it was featured the way it was played with scott solo at the piano was haunting  powerfuljust a great song when i saw that there was a cd of it i considered getting it and finally did unfortunately i didnt do my homework and was very disappointed to find that the cd version takes a sweet piano performance and turns it into a less touching and more forgettable easy listening rock song that doesnt do his onscreen performance of the song justice and apparently the only place to get the pianoonly version is on the episode the rest of the cd is a mixed bag scott bakula is definitely multitalented and it is enjoyable and fun to hear him play some of the different songs from the showbut nothing fantastic the only standout vocal song on the disc would have been somewhereand that was ruined for me by the easy listening chorus the instrumental tracks are okayim admittedly not a big fan of instrumental music so take my review with that grain of salt includedas opposed to many reviewers i quite enjoyed the interview clip it was fun to hear some of scotts background and what he enjoyed about working on the show and how great is it to hear straight from the stars mouth that he would love to take the role up again in the future as a fan thats really nice to hearso my take isif youre a ql fan and you can get it used for a decent price its fun for a listen nonfans should probably look elsewhere|0
i remember where i was when man walked on moon i remember where i was when i heard the news about jfk  i remember where i was when i heard my first rush song called in the end from the just released album called fly by night after being exposed to the noise pollution of katy perry and justin beiber for the last six months i feel i was cleansed of that filth by clockwork angels the title track is the best song on this cd in my opinion this album has a different sound when compared to previous rush albums violins and piano is not the usual rush i am used to but the more i play this cd the more i accept it i guess the farewell to kings thru hold your fire sound couldnt last forever|1
being a fan of the 80s music scene i read a lot of positive feedback on the band go west and decided to take a chance on buying their greatest hits in a used bin  only being familiar with king of wishful thinking when looking at the track listing i figured that they might be one of those bands that had hits on the radio and you just didnt know it was them  in this case we close our eyes and faithful are two such songs that were played adnauseum on the most commercial of radio stations and certainly didnt help to impress me with the rest of the best  the overproduced oversynthesized sound that plagues the overall sound of this band makes bands like omd and erasure sound 21st century by comparison  on top of that i felt like i was listening to a rick astley album the whole time and in my opinion that is not a good compliment  if you are a fan of music that is played by radio stations that are home to artists like michael bolton celine dion and other soft rock favorites you may very well enjoy this album thoroughly  but by being mislead into thinking that this band had the potential to be in the class of other underrated 80s bands such as crowded house dream academy and talk talk i am left feeling insulted that they fall under the same class of lackluster bands such as the fine young cannibals and simply red  instantly forgettablego somewhere else to find better music|0
just got mine and threw it into the player  but i have to turn it up all the way even to hear it  obviously something went wrong in production or somewhere  sounds like it might be a good version otherwise  oh well ill just call it a loss and get another version  dont know if this is a common problem with chandos or just with this cd|0
when i first heard this in an earlier centuty i had no idea what was coming  this has been one of my very favorite recordings since then  amazing depth of talent and musical emotion|1
richard strauss is territory barenboim should have stayed away from when we already have astoundingly marvellous versions of alpine symphony available elsewhere  karajan with the virtuosic berlin philharmonic kempe and the inspired dedicatees of the work itself the incandescent dresden staatskapelle and blomstedts stupendous san francisco recording  barenboim and the sadly unrecognizable cso are roundly outclassed in this repertoire one is amazed that this is the same orchestra who worked musical miracles under reiner and solti the playing throughout is bland limp and uninspired and the recording is amazing  muffled distant and murky|0
everything on this cd can be found in magazine interviews posted on one of the rollins fan websites save your money|0
this is probably the quintesenstial pink floyd album  it is also probably the reason why the band ended up breaking up  it is heavily dominated by roger waters and is probably somewhat of an autobiography of his life as his life seems to mirror pinks  it is a very well written album  the vocals and guitars are top notch  definately one of the top albums in rock|1
not a shock comic  funny without being vulgar  made me laugh didnt make me ashamed|1
this is the only place in the world where a fatugly drug dealer can become a starhis voice is mediocre and he wouldnt of got anywhere without poop diddythe beats to the songs on this album are okay but are nothing specialoverall this album lacks substance and creativitytoo many sampled parts in the music and poop diddys voice is annoyinghe glorified violence and ignorance so thats what led to his demisehe is way overrated like 50 cent and eminemdo not buy this garbage|0
he cant sing he barks he has little breath control and cannot sustain long notes and there is no inflection to his performance marking different emotional states or the different points in hoffmanns development so its  a failure of voice as well as actingi wouldnt be surprised if naganos very rapid pacing was to hide alagnas flaws i like a faster paced hoffmann and with the added material its not only preferable but maybe necessary but this is ridiculous with no consideration for which passages should be slower which should pick up the pace its as if an lp is being played halfway between the right and wrong speed  certainly van dam sings in better voice on the shicoff recording i wonder if conductor and cast are doing their best to hide alagnas weaknesseseverything else about the recording is fine i agree that sound effects should have been included im not sorry about the loss of scintille diamant and think the sextet should have been cut as well not because there is a thing wrong with them they are both beautiful but the former is an interpolation offenbach never intended for this opera and the latter is a variation on the barcarolle created years after offenbachs  death they simply dont belongbut its all futile because alagna spoils everything|0
i have had the chance to hear quite a few cuts from this before buying this album mostly via radio dont i love the fact that you can listen to radio stations all over the world after waiting 5 years a new album from the holy triumvirate all loose ends from singles releases tied up we had in 2010 the release of caravan and bu2b both of which are on this album but have been remixed a little but dont stray from the basic idea just to wet the appetites of the fans headlong flight was released ahead of the album as a single which had the touches of some of bastille day and anthem sort of tying in the 70s rush that some have been dying to hear the garden actually was released in some markets just on radio and it shows a softer side to this band written beautifully musically with the addition of stringed instrumentsif you were looking for the 2112 form of rush it isnt here musically but it is in a sense conceptually all of the songs tie together in some form of telling a story which is the exact reason these guys are tops on my list as far as talent goes you might if you are a fan sit there listening saying no these guys havent blown me away listen to this in headphones with a rock equalizer setting and stereo headphones that will blow you away i can say that my favourite cut from this is one that i had to wait to hear until after the album was released which was the anarchist it kind of fits me since i dont always follow rules but get this album if for nothing else to add to your collection it isnt presto which i think was probably one of the worst albums put out there by them but it definitely isnt 2112 or hemispheres the latter of which is my favourite but it does equal their time before going into concept albums with complexed music and themes to tunes example fly by night though that does have one concept tune of bytor and the snow dog|1
perhaps this might have been considered good when it came out and when most of these reviews were written about 11 years ago  however this is nothing compared to the later work of simon posford the force behind hallucinogen younger brother and shpongle  this one and the lone deranger are quite repetitive one dance beat repeats all the way through most of the songs simon is just getting the knack of his synthesizers on these early works i only kept one song from these 2 albums on my music player and even it isnt a standout in dub by hallucinogen on the other hand is much much better as it was produced years later and is slower paced trippier dub  in fact in dub ranks very high on simons discography imo afficionados of simons later work can forget about the two sophomoric hallucinogens|0
cd arrived quickly in likenew condition as advertised plays perfectly i love this cd i had a cassette of this years ago and did not realize it was on cd this was on of my favorite blues albums i listened to when first learning about the blues genre you have to have big ones to claim youre the legendary blues band and these guys deliver former muddy waters bandsmen|1
1979 i bought this on cassette back then and it immediately became my favorite album and still is dangalmost 30 years where has the time gone|1
if you like 1 sammy haggar 2 joe satriani 3 van halen or most any other 80s rockhard rock band you will like this sophomore effort by chickenfoot as well as their first one  these are rock legends just having fun making music the way they like to make rock music and so the way i like to hear rock music each musician is great at what he does and they come together as a group to record an equally great record ok no trackbytrack commentary etc just go buy this and play the heck out of it loud|1
these are clearly fine players who have captured the nuances of these fine works however i found the recording to be boomysounds like it was recorded in a barn and at times the intonation is a little off nothing is too bad but it sounds like they didnt get too many takes to create the perfect recording which is the standard nowadays|0
many maiden fans remember the original maiden japan ep from back in the early 80s  even then it was hard to come by  the ep only had five tracks running in this order1 running free2 remember tomorrow3 wrathchild4 killers5 innocent exilethe cd issue is very nice  remastered and expanded to 17 tracks1 wrathchild2 purgatory3 sanctuary4 remember tomorrow5 another life w drum solo6 genghis khan7 killers8 innocent exile9 twilight zone10 strange world11 murders in the rue morgue12 phantom of the opera13 iron maiden14 running free15 transylvania w guitar solo16 drifter17 ive got the firewow what a collection of early maidenall performed by the original band  i still prefer the beast over hammersmith set  but only because i lean towards bruce  but maiden japan is totally worthwhile  even if it costs too much|0
there is a lot about the movie that i just dont really care for the characters being probably the biggest problem of hell on earth terry farrell was annoying as the lead and the slime ball club owner who you are supposed to hate just wasnt that interesting if anything he was just as annoying as terry the story itself isnt that memorable either out of the four theatrical hellraiser movies this is my least favorite|0
the first time i heard of flyleaf they opend up for breaking benjamin the had an awsome amount of energy and sound so i bought thier ep and they sound just the same as they did live i look to see them be a big name in rock soon|1
mermaids was a great film and had great music in it but the soundtrack neglects to include almost all of the best songs eydie gormes blame it on the bossa nova rosemary clooneys mambo italiano peggy lees fever marvin gayes stubborn kind of fellow jimmy gilmer  the fireballs sugar shack betty everettes the shoop shoop song sure we get chers version but its not the same then there are songs that i have only ever seen in this film and only know lines from in the film as being the titles of these songs lets walk some more who does that i dont know and dominique which i think was a 1963 hit for the singing nun and the trumpet song that lou played in his shop when he first met rachel mrs flaxand the girlsone reviewer said that this soundtrack brings the film to life through music  have you seen the film the songs i have mentioned here are the songs that bring it to life and are the most memorable  but they are not on the soundtrackif you have ever seen mermaids you will be disappointed with this soundtrack while there are some great songs on it the best songs are missing which brings down the whole collection perhaps the people who compiled this cd should have compiled the soundtrack in two parts like with the big chill in order to include the films most memorable tunes and some all time classicsone star  dont waste you money|0
actually the problem is not really the picture but the bar code numbers that amazon uses for this product sellers must enter the bar code numbers and they automatically end up in with amazons listing that they associate with this bar code yes the picture is incorrect and can cause problems with the buyers but the reason sellers items get listed here is because the identification numbers they use are incorrect on amazon clear as mud right|0
i get sound but no picture not quite what i paid for this was the only time ive had any problem so far|0
this woman cant sing its the adult bubble gum pop whoever compared and stated celine dion and laura pausini as similar go check yourselfi could give less stars but the minimum is one and besides i woke up in a good mood|0
nothing to say really it is the beatles rubber soul unless they remastered it and ruined it well i will have to listen to know if that happenedhowever no jewel case on a beatles cd what an insultreally we are getting nickled and dimed to deathbut to cheap out on the beatles|0
i have read all previous reviews thats why i bought this cd and id like to add my opinion toothis cd is a very good collection of folk and soviet favourites those who would like to refresh lyrics will find it very useful but the performancevoice for me personally were rather disappointing those who expect anything like shulzhenko ili zykina style can skip this disk the performance is on the level of a friend singing in a small company in the second part of the evening for a singing friend the voice is beautiful and interpretation is very interesting but for a wider audience  i couldnt help thinking that this is not an appropriate level|0
abbey road does not contain a single track that is as good as i feel fine  there i said it  for all its heaviosity from lennons belabored come together to mccartneys suite of snippets abbey road reveals a group of artists finally without a healthy vision  one might as well say without a viable vision as they then decided to call it quits  on abbey road the boys left well behind the glad exuberance of the early works beatles for sale and the edgy romanticism of the midworks rubber soul to end up with songs that are spiritless and overwrought  come together and shes so heavy are loud complaints that sounded a lot better when i was much younger  oh darling is derivative and also loud  maxwells silver hammer is absolute slumming  something is drossa dreary sentimental lyricism that makes my teeth hurt  the secondside suite has some nicer moments yet it maintains a thinness throughout  its strungtogether passages of energy and harmony exist as testaments to individual longer works that might have been  the lyrics too fail coming up short of the humor and insight of earlier beatle works  mean mister mustard  sorry|0
i gotta admit im a bit surprised at how generously people are rating this album  i bought it because people raved about it so much  my wife and i listened to it on our drive to indianapolis this weekend and  we found it very lackluster  im not saying all other reviews here are wrong im glad they enjoyed it  however this album pales in comparison to other works out there  it simply doesnt measure up to the likes of todd barry or mitch hedburg  not even closeit is an uncommonly clean album which is nice to see once in a while but i still just cant ignore that it didnt make me laugh much  it went beyond being clean into just plain nonthreatening and i wonder if thats what some like about it  i would love to see more comedians out there who can do clean material that still sets people on edgeas for this album i simply cant recommend it  it feels very dated even though its only from 1997  carlin has stuff from the 70s that feel timeless  that will never be the case with regans album  he is not the skilled writer or performer on par with other guys out there  but thats my experience with the album  if it absolutely makes someone elses day brighter thats great|0
i ordered it for my son  he is a big  rush fan and has all of their recordings  hes the one who rated it he just loves it|1
i am a huge fan of chopin  honestly i would have enjoyed this a lot better if there was not a distracting static or scratching noise in the background  i found myself paying more attention to that than the music  but i gave it two stars because the music is lovely  i guess i should have read the reviews before selecting it|0
hahaha what a joke who all likes awful bands in the beatles pink floyd rolling stones steve miller boston queen and acdc so much they all suck and the beatles white album has to be one of the stupidest dumbest cds on the planet contains awful jokes in while my guitar gently weeps each and every songespecially that one is awful stay far away from this and go download songs from foreigner dire straits green day gnr and nirvana insted im glad you cant download the beatles as they suck|0
i have heard great and i mean great music  led zeppelin is considered to be the greatest band  i disagree  they are one of the greatest bands or come in a very close second  pink floyd is the greatest band  i know several people will disagree with me but thats okay  i am just stating my musical opinion  this album is greati grew up listening to my dads dark side of the moon  when i was younger i couldnt appreciate the music that i now know is some of the greates music in existence  i was finally able to acquire this album after listening to the vinyl version which is unbelievable  i have to say i love this album  i listen to it all the time while im cooking or doing homework  its incredibly soothing  its the beginnings of progressive rock that this band started  the style of music is incredible not always favored by everyone  some may call it an acquired taste  from songs like young lust to comfortably numb never does it get old  with lyrics that sometimes seem to make no sense they are filled with deep symbolism  though this is only my musical opinion i urge you to stop listening to all the crap played today such as yellowcard and kanye west and please dont be like all the kids in my school  this is not to say there isnt good music in the present but branch out from the pop and rap fad it will only lead to bad and worse music|1
i would give this no stars but theyre making me give at least 1i remember when my mom bought this for me at the time i thought it was cool but now ive realized how lame it actually is seriously its a rapping cat if youre going to make your kid listen to christian music i suggest relient k switchfoot anberlin five iron frenzy things like that you really cant even call it music|0
ive been a fan of this cd since it originally came out still one of the best from this group although lacey is gone i believe i will always be a fan of this band cant wait to hear their new sound|1
i am one of those listeners who is not didactic about historically informed performance practice versus modern approaches i have heard performances from both schools that were moving and performances from both that were disappointing  for me unfortunately this was one of the latterkarajans style whether conducting bach or stravinsky was distinctively karajan  there was an emphasis on smooth sonics  this is very very smooth bach which seems questionably apt given the subject matter  there is little drama here  the opening movement is a case in point  it has neither the sheer monumentality of klemperer nor the urgency of gardinerbecause reactions to solo voices are so subjective i wont spend a great deal of time on them  for me janowitz and ludwig are an acquired taste that i have not acquiredat least not in this music  but whatever your opinion of the soloists a high quality choir is critical because the chorus is so important to this work  unfortunately i must say that the vienna singverein did not do well  the tenor sound tends to jump out of the choir which does not blend well as a whole  and there are also places where the sopranos do not make the loveliest of soundsbecause this work is so powerful and has such profound spiritual depths karajans eyes needed to be elsewhere than on his own reflection|0
i have never understood all the fuss over the beatles they couldnt sing werent good looking and played the same guitar music over and over that you cant even dance to britney spears has much more talent and is alot cuter than they ever were one more time is the greatest pop album of alltimenot any overatted beatles album|0
this review was used for the full recording and can be applied absolutely to the highlights errr low lightsyou know 1995 was a bad bad year for this musical all of the recordings i have heard form this year are bad rotten junk garbage etc this is no exception judas needs have passion and range and this judas has wailing and a tons of missed high notes what confuses me is how do these studio albums make it out of the studio one of these musicians or technicians has to have perfect pitch heck normal pitch and anyone listening to this in the first minute is going to realize that this studio recording missed wide not to mention the stylings of rowe are abysmalugggg again|0
i am very tired of reviewers comparing agnetha to frida and viceversai am interested in what reviewers thing of the cd not who likes one better than the other combining their voices made the abba soundi have heard many of their cds and frankly i guess i just miss how theysounded with the group when singing solo i long for the tempo and subjectmatter of the abba songs i really havent found what im looking for withtheir individual albums|0
like the title says this cd is a masterpiece its without question rushs best material since presto 1989 power windows 1985 and moving pictures 1981 everything that made rush great is heavily featured here cryptic scifi lyrics weird ass high vocals insane musicianship complex compositions totally unpredictable arrangements and tons of fast and furious playing with guitar bass and drum breakdowns all over the placeits the rush we all love and strong as evernow while the majority of rush fans are in agreement that this is their most inspired record in years there is a minority of fans that dont like this album the main complaint is the sound now whats wrong with the sound its sound like a modern record thats it now theres absolutely nothing wrong with that but when a large portion of rush fans are in their late 40s  its a problem you see rush sounds as modern and contemporary as mars volta muse coheed and cambria avenged sevenfold foo fighters stone sour deftones etc and whats wrong with that well those are the type of bands that a lot 40 olds run away from as a result they dont understand the sound and feel like the album is mixed too loud messy without sonic clarity etc let me tell you something this album sounds absolutely excellent it sounds like a loud kick ass modern rock album because thats exactly what it isnick rasckulinecz foo fighters produced the album btwin conclusion if you are a young rush fan or an old rush fan that is open minded to a modern rock sound then you will love this album however if you are a fan that never gave alternative bands a chance in the 90s and continued ignoring modern rock bands in the 00s then you will have a problem with this album because rush sounds so modern in other words if you like modern music this is a bonafide 5 stars album if you dont listen to anything modern and spend all day listening to 70s and 80s records then this will be about 3 stars for you cuz it will sound too weird and alien for you|1
i was disapointed with this disck no matter the title name of the music most are the theme of the godfather only its played with a slite various in the begining i dont think it was worth the cost to listen to the godfather theme over and over again  julius j yuhasz jrwarren ohio 44485|0
there are 3 or four really good songs here young lust hey you comfortably numb  run like hell  with a total of 26 tracks and only a few good songs i dont see how this can be considered a classic album  as an album its mostly filler rambling on and oni guess this was intended as a concept album or a rock opera  either way i really cant find out what the plot for the album is  i guess its suppossed to be orwellian about totalitarianism  but is doesnt show that too clearlyand how many hours does this album run on for  17  i really dont see how anyone could sit through this entire album in a single listening  its way too long and very boringi find pink floyd overrated  they have a huge cult following and there music isnt even good  i guess you have to be stoned to enjoy itthe lyrics are confusing and dull to me and the music is very slow paced  if a group wants to make a concept album i think they should avoid adding so many filler tracks that is the one and two minute blurbs that they put it to help define the story  this album has too many of those fillersi kinda used to like floyd though now i cant understand why  i know they wanted to be artistic and progressive but to me theyre boring and pretentious  ive only heard 3 floyd albums dark side wish you and wall  they all are long and boring  frankly the only good songs ive ever heard by floyd get played on the radio so i dont see whyd i should want to own their albums|0
if you like acid rock and rock n roll then you have to get this albumroger describes society and how it functions many of these functions are not seen by the people and were not even spoken ofits a very funky album yet dark too some lyrics may even sound suicidal and homicidalhehehehehe you got to love it|1
im not one for breaking down every song and writing lots about each  but i do want to give my 2 cents and say i truly think this is a great album  im still in the first impression stage as i just picked it up last night but from where i stand right now im really enjoying it  musically lyrically the whole package  its hard to explain but when i hear a great rush song it transports me back to when i was younger makes me feel like clueless teenager again this entire cd has done just that  i couldnt wait for lunch today so i could run out to my car and pop the cd back on  its funny i always have an overwhelming urge to thank geddy neil and alex personally after a new cd is released  a lots changed over the decades but the one constant has been great music by my favorite band of all time   if youre on the fence pick up clockwork angelsit will not disappoint|1
actually if i were going to go beyond the idea of a concept album with the wall i would be more inclined to call it an oratorio similar to jethro tulls thick as a brick or passion play rather than a rock opera like jesus christ superstar or the whos tommy that is because the over riding unity of the songs in the wall is thematic rather than narrative in nature the bleak double album is roger waters meditation on the walls human beings build up to ensure their survival in the postmodern world it is also something of a departure from the groups previous albums most notably the dark side of the moon and wish you were here it that the groups signature cosmic rock sound is giving way to some more traditional pop music sensibilities the compelling electronics and other special effects that had become key components of pink floyds music and which put dark side of the moon on the chart for literally years now takes a back seat to the themes and lyrics although there are still some choice moments such as when gomer pyle shows up on nobody homethe story such as it is concerns a rock star named pink no subtlety here boys and girls who is disgusted with the lesser human being he has become as a result of his celebrity the key song in the album is comfortably numb cowritten by lead guitarist dave gilmour which is one of the classic rock songs about alienation although obviously the title begs to have it labeled a song about intoxication by the drug on your choice but the context for lyrics such as you are only coming through in wavesyour lips move but i cant hear what youre saying is clearly about the despair of being disconnected from humanity it is also a lament about the lose of childhood which remains in waters vision the time when we are at our best as human beingswhen i was a child i caught a fleeting glimpseout of the corner of my eyei turned to look but it was gonei cannot put my finger on it nowthe child is grown the dream is gonei have become comfortably numbthe music for comfortably numb is both operatic and eerie a paradox that is nonetheless accurate the relentlessly depressing picture of a rock stars life would have you worrying about the mental health of roger waters if it were not for the suspicion he is writing as much about the life in general and former pink floyd lead guitarist and main songwriter syd barrett as it is an attempt at catharsis by waters after spitting on a fan during a concert for daring to applaud during an acoustic number i always was struck by the start of mother with one of the very best examples of a caesura with the extremely effective pause between the first line mother do you think theyll drop the bomb and the second mother do you think theyll like this song there is a world of meaning in the vocal silence there that i have never forgottenthere are two pitfalls to the wall the first is that pink floyd released a rare single with another brick in the wall part 2 which mean that school children rebelling against the system now had something to sing throughout the year while waiting for the end of the year to do alice coopers schools out consequently in the popular consciousness the wall was boiled down to the following potent lyricswe dont need no educationwe dont need no thought controlno dark sarcasm in the classroomteachers leave them kids alonehey teachers leave them kids aloneall in all its just another brick in the wallall in all youre just another brick in the wallyet taken in its totality it can hardly be said that the primary purpose of this doublealbum was an attack on the educational system in england in song after song the character is blaming others for his troubles so it is not surprising that teachers end up on that list but the success of the single made it seem this was what the whole thing was all about for that matter there are more songs concerned with the threat of nuclear destruction mother goodbye blue skies than education by the time you through waters paranoia over great britain becoming fascist run like hell the whole indictment of education seems like just another well you know what which would be the point rightthe second concern is that the disparity between the highs and lows on this album are rather substantial it is rather like sitting through an opera and some of recitatives eg goodbye cruel world to get to the arias eg hey you the best tracks on this album are as pretty good but you still have to sit through some less than stellar sections eg one of my turns the loose narrative is not enough to help us connect the dots and i suspect it is only by really getting totally into the album and trying to achieve consubstantiality with the creative vision of roger waters that you can really make sense of it all this is why the production values of the wall as performed by pink floyd in concert tended to replace the psychological dimensions of listening to it in the dark in your roomthe key thing here is that there are moments in the wall that match its ambition the sum is greater than the total of the parts but there is certainly nothing wrong with that being the case|1
this album is really not as good as you may hear it certainly doesnt hold a candle to wish you were here which is my personal favorite or animals there are some very impressive tracks from the wall but not enough to be called pink floyds greatest album there are too many sketchy points in this album its not as strong or as consistent as some of their earlier works i find myself skipping through most of the songs because either theyre too bland and insipid or theyre exactly like the song i just heard some of the highlights of the wall are in the flesh hey you and goodbye blue sky im not saying the wall is horrible or even bad im just saying that this is not the first pink floyd album you should go for i think that you should get familiar with pink floyd before you listen to the wall only fans of pink can truly appreciate it|1
i saw instant results  very relevant and very effective without being preachy or otherwise offensive  rhondas voice is perfect for this and its obvious that she is a caring person|1
while i think cs deserves more than 2stars from a song review standpoint i cant give it more than 2stars due to the extremely poor mastering  the level of compression used to master this recording exceeds anything ive heard  this may be suitable for the mp3 format listened to on stock earbuds but it is sad to hear it on home audio gear of any quality  i love to listen to music loud and i love to listen to rush loud  but i found this album fatiquing after just a couple songs maybe if enough of us complain about the mastering they will take stock and issue a lesscompressed version that audio enthusiasts can enjoy|0
prince doesnt let just anybody remake his stuff and after hearing this i can see why|0
this book is the best way i have found to try to explain to people what it was like  what it felt like sounded like smelled like  to be in downtown hollywood or on hollywood blvd during the mid to late 80s members of a band going down the street with a handfull of flyers and a staple gun plastering their images all over evey telephone pole or vacant place only to have another band come along 30 minutes later and cover it all up with their flyers going into the clothing and leather shops for spandex studded belts wristbands bandannas and shades  it was an amazing time and place that will never be again but for those who were there even for a moment it will live forever and for those who never got there this book well help to to at least understand a little bit what it was like i still have some of the flyers in this book|1
this music represents the insanity in all of us  we are no different than pink floydas fans of pink floyd we share the same genetic genious of these incredible musicianshowever our role is only to consume this musicbeing genuine fans of this music clearly indicates that we are all crazy and can be very proud to be a member of this elite club of lunatics|1
the series was awesome but the cd it really could have done with at least something from the series soundtrack like even the original start and end themes are absent from the cd the sketches are a bit of fun the  sound quality is excellent apart from the sound clips of the general which  really could have been betterits be great if they would release an  album with background music from the series so you can pop it in your car  fire up the v8 and go blasting down some dirt roads screaming  yeehaaa out the window|0
i greatly admire this score by sondheim  i have often found it to be one of his most emotionally wrought pieces unfortunately this recording comes across as a soulless effortwhat i find most woeful is what was done  with jonathan tunicks astounding orchestrations a case in point the  glorious brass of the title song is replaced by a pathetically synthesized  sound those brass sections of that song are among the most thrilling  sounds ive ever heard on a cast recording strident angry a clarion call  to take frank back to his past unfortunately on this recording the tinny  sound doesnt drive itself inside your mind and inside your heart and you  dont feel as though frank is being driven to relive his past by something  he cannot controlsecond only to the orchestrations in what i find  problematic are the vocalists now they are a cast with impressive  credentials and equally impressive voices malcolm gets michele pawk  adriane lenox and cass morgan are the names that stand out but they  dont have what it takes to carry this score on the original broadway  cast recording those youths had a raw edgy sound in much the same way as  aforementioned brass was raw and edgy the pain anger and frustration  that drove the score in the obc recording are gone replaced by smoothly  polished wellrefined singing voices  and it kills the emotional  content i was most disappointed by the rendition of franklin  shephard inc here the anger and bitterness of lonny price on the  obc recording is here replaced by the hohum delivery of adam heller  again im not saying hes not a good singer but rather that hes not the  right singer for this rolei suspect the obc had an added benefit   not only were they young and raw but the show had closed the day before  they recorded the album after a sixteenshow run no doubt their pain and  anger and frustration from that was poured out into their  recordingdont bother with this recording its slick its neat  and  its soulless|0
this cd a carnival of voices is wonderful and another example of why ellis paul is such an amazing singersong writer ive listened to ellis paul for over ten years and he just improves with time so many people ive talked to do not know his name or his music and they have certainly missed outeach of the songs on this cd tells a heartfelt storyand the music enhances the storyif you purchase this cd believe me you wont be disappointed and youll wonder why it took you so long to hear the music of this wonderful man and musician|1
ive had the misfortune to listen to this album at work where someone was using it to test the audio components of a system were designing  if you have any regard for the feelings of other living creatures you will neither buy nor play this albumthis entire album is a grating witless attempt at a joke for people whove had their funny bones fileted  as if christmas songs werent already syrupy and cloying enough they are rendered here by squeaky samples of cat noises reproduced to a backing track that sounds like one of those cheap walmart home synthesizers for kidsin any sensate human being this might yield a smirk for the first 30 seconds of the first track  the entire 74 minutes of the rest of the album is alas superfluous being merely a repetition of exactly the same thing  over  and over  againi realise that there are people out there who seem without any irony to actually enjoy this kind of stultified idiocy  if you like this album you might also want to try some similar products in other media such as the charlies angels movie or perhaps a painting by thomas kinkade|0
garbage pure unadulterated garbage this is music for lameos who sit in their libraries drinking tea and discussing philosiphy the beatles my foot more like the beetles that need to be exterminatednow now some of the beatles albums were ok but this what the hell to you mean the white album so stupid they couldnt think up a name|0
i wrote a blowbyblow account of the albums music yesterday on my website which i wont repost here however i will say that despite the fact that this is easily as heavy an album as the last four or five outings i also think its the most melodic diverse progressive thing theyve recorded since at least hold your fire and probably going back todare i say itpermanent waves and moving pictures its not a hoary old prog classic in the vein of 2112 or hemispheres but it is a highly listenable concept album that doesnt sound dated or out of character for the band that rush is todayi also dont like giving five star reviews because i dont want people to get the impression im too easily impressed however this album has everything i wanted from a rush album in 2012 so i cant help but give it the high five my review draws favourable comparisons to past albums but in no way do i think this album is derivative or lost in time its a fantastic song cycle just listen to it with open ears and a willingness to accept that they can still play all those classics but they arent going to deliberately repeat those albums no matter how hard we wish for it considering how uncharacteristically hookladenandyetprogressive this album is why would we want them to|1
im not going to get verbose like some ill just say that this should have never been done  im surprised that richard chamberlain would have stooped to acting out such bad writing  father ralph beating up luke oneill in a fist fight  come onthe writing was bad the acting was worse  if i could have given it negative stars i would have  i debated watching it until the end but i endured every painful minute and its in my circular file now|0
i am a huge fan of evanesence and i stumbled upon this band they are a definite rock band with a christian twist but anyone can enjoy it cassie is probably the most religious of all the songs talking about the girl at columbine who answered yes if she believed in god so the shooters killed her this is a great band and the singer reminds me of amy lee except minus some of the lung power i love most of the songs on here such as all around me im sorry im so sick and cassie if you have heard any of evanesence this band sounds similar i really enjoyed this cd and have listened to it a lot|1
no doubt that this album is nothing short of brilliant but be warned its not an easy one to sit through as it takes the listener on an emotional roller coster rideok so a lot of other people have explained that this is a concept album and it is true the album is loosely held together by the notion of the one mans journey behind his own emotional wall  however do not be put off by this as their are many songs here that can and do stand on their own  such as comfortably numb another brick in the wall part 2 run like hell young lust and hey youthere are a lot of tracks on the album that are there to seque together the real meaty songs and as such they can be considered filler but when listening to the overall album you can see where they fitthe album is a dark ride and could be considered depressing if the melodies and vocal harmonies werent so beautiful  goodbye ble sky has a depressing lyric but is held up by the beach boy like harmonies and dave gilmours airy accoustic guitar work  comfortably numb has the beautiful contrast of the dark verses sung by waters rising up to the etherealdreamy chorus sung by gilmour before his guitar takes you to another place in the outroyouve gotta be in the mood to listen to some of this albums more theatrical points like the trial which is a mind bender and something you would be more likely to find in an oliver twist like musicalstill there is much great music on this cd and its well worth a listen if you havent already|1
let me tell you something about this cd it is perfect if you suffer from insominia i cant tell you how many times iv literally fell asleep from listeing to this thing trying to get into it how is it that this album so praised pink floyd has struck me as nothing more then marketable drug addict rock desinged for the stoner crowd sadly they are still as popular today as they were back then and it now seems trendy to listen to pink floyd as wellthe wall is the most boring pos i have ever listened to in my life it is a retread of the album wish you were here only more pretentious more bloated and more mastrobatory wait mastrobatory that word in general perfectly sums up pfs music but the wall takes it to even greater and more pretentious heights another brick in the wall gets almost more airplay then any other song i can think of why this song has no redeeming qaulity to it at all the song is an attack on conformity boy that sure is original i also had the unfortunate experience of also seeing the wall movie and i caan tell it is nearly as bad and mastrobatory as the album is a rockstar doing drugs and going insane wow thats never been attempted before this thing is even beating out the overrated dsotm in a overindulgent mastrobation fest what the hell was roger waters injecting into himself when he wrote this album iv owned this thing for years and have always meant to throw it away in the trash where it belongs but never got around to it it has some how always been hanging around for some reason as a testament to remind me how horrible music can get at times avoid the pos like the plauge and never let anyone tell you this thing is even remotly good or tell you to buy itin summary this thing should of been a huge flop but for some reason the drug addicts ate it up and now it is a classic|0
one of the great things about the floyd is that as a rule the music came first and lyrics second the floyd made excellent music full of mood atmosphere and ear numbing guitar solos lyrics and political agenda were sometimes prevelient in floyd albums but never took a front seat to the music these are the reasons that this album is such a disappointment you could tell starting with the album animals that lyrics were becoming more important to roger waters bassist and main lyrcist than the music even with the wall the lyrics were playing a major role buy there was still some great music comfortably numb hey you mother etc this album is where the lyrics and the political agenda of rogers waters took over and the music became minimalized no mood music no great guitar solos just roger waters ranting about post war englad and margret thatcher there are a few songs i do enjoy the heroes return and the gunners dream not now john added some much needed rock and roll to this depressing album and some singing by david gilmour lead guitarist it should be noted that by this time the rest of the band had been relagated to session mucicians and this album is considered by many to be a waters solo album in all but name judging by his other solo album i would have to agree i couldnt help but feel like was being hit over the head with political ravings and no pink floyd music to cushion the blows|0
let me start by saying that this review reflects more the products description and amazons handling of this product  the music is awesome and timeless and i will include a section reviewing the actual product that i received belowok so as some other reviewers have pointed out there seems to be some kind of mess up on amazons side and the product description section of the items page despite the version that you are actually looking at for purchase is for the wall  immersion box set  this is a box set with all kinds of little goodies in it the regular studio recording remastered a live recording demo recordings a dvd and just all kinds of fun stuff currently 10788 on amazon  i however was looking to buy the wall on vinyl and was under the impression from the description that i would be getting all of this great stuff but in a vinyl format instead of on cd  simply opening the amazon box proved me wrong  what i received is exactly what is in the picture that i posted  2 records and a code to download the mp3s  this is still nice and great but not what i was expectingonce i saw this i looked into it and found that all of the wall items have the same description which really only describes one item  also any review left for one item shows on all of the item pages  i would not be surprised if someone reading this is looking at the regular cd another at the vinyl and maybe even another considering buying a cassette tape  so as fair warning look look look and make sure that you are buying what you think you are buyingnow to review the actual item that i received  mmmmmm nice  180 gram vinyl of a classic  it looks feels and sounds amazing  the only thing even slightly disappointing is that the album cover is just the wall bricks and the text pink floyd the wall is a sticker stuck to the front  it looks a little cheesy and you can even see the brick lines through the thin sticker  it was a pretty lame choice by the manufacturer but whateverafter removing it from the plastic there is a sticker that falls off of the back  this sticker accurately describes exactly what is included in the package  i am really not sure why it is a sticker but i am glad that it was not stuck to the back of the album coveropening the package reveals a large poster with the wall bricks and the lyrics to every song between the folds of the cover  very nice  each album is in its own plastic bag but also has a thin cardboard slip cover with the lyrics to each side of each disk very similar to the posterfinally there is another small piece of paper that includes a code for downloading the high quality mp3sthis is probably the eighth copy of the wall that i have bought over my life but the first vinyl copy  over all i would say that it was 50 well spent|0
brian regan is certainly better to see live or on video as his physical actions add to the humor but this album contains a lot of his good comedy and is at a good price the end seemed to be a bit abrupt but overall we really enjoyed this album and laughed most of the way through|1
okay so chickenfoot iii has finally arrived an in todays market of supposed supergroups chickenfoot really stands on its own  their first release was a breath of fresh air for the limited hard rock scene the album has been released in four different releases but seriously do yourself a favor an get the reg ed  the inside is cool with 3d glasses with four band photos of each member with stats such as riffs played in a nite etc an this is really a great value for the price of a reg ed of a new release heck i have purchased deluxe ed of other cds that different offer such value dont buy the deluxe ed unless your just dying for more of the same commentary of behind the scenes footage of the band making this album an it has zero bonus tracks save your cash buy the standard ed release i loved the original album and i own of copy of the second chickenfoot release which was a extra track bitten by the wolf  a dvd wwhite coverart but chickenfoot iii is in a class of its own  personally this is the best work that sammy and m anthony have ever done together  sammy hagar is singing better then he has in years his song writing is great along with m anthony now singing two part harmonies  playing a louder more in the fore front bass then in the original release  the original chickenfoot album had more of a joe satriani feel to it an this album simply has more of a vanhagar feel  by that i mean simply that the song writing vocals bass and guitar work are more refined and built to work within songs more then to simply showcase satrianis skill set of crazy multiple riffs not to bash satrianihe is the main reason this band exists at all but this has more of a van  hagar feel  highlights include big foot different devil come closer an lastly alright alright really their are zero you heard it zero bad songs on this album  buy it now |1
this band if thats what you want to call these posers are nothingbut a fadded teen idol pop group from back in the day they were basically the back in the day version of n sync they copied other bands to  make themselfs look good do yourself a favor and dont buy this album  dont even accpect it even if its free the loser bug pop group is a waste  of time and they are so boring just like the boring no life baby boomers  defending them this album has pointless tracks and they are all boring to  listen to they werent the greatest or the best  they sucked they were all studiothey couldnt play  live from what i  heard and no i am not some loser baby boomer skip this albumin fact  skip the beatles all together|0
this album is appropriately named  its named in honor of the weapon you are most likely to use in your suicide after listening to this godawful piece of crap|0

dreadful album doesnt sound anything like the rejects sounds like some 80s southern hard rock band nothing interesting or catchy at all on this disc|0
i took a chance on the gypsy kings thinking that with all the rave reviews this album might be right up my alley  there are a few tracks that i enjoy but personally i find there is too much singing  i just enjoy listening to the instruments  oh well  you never know until you try|0

tildets evening meditation is the best one out there i have tried several relaxing meditation cds and nothing has relaxed me like this one her cd puts me in such a relaxed state it puts me to sleep  her voice has such a calming effect i have purchased several of these cds for friends and family members who cant sleep they have thanked me because it worksterry|1
im a total satch fan but this release sounded overall phoned in the singingscreaming n yelling just overdone and out of place too often maybe the next one will be better the first release had at least a good handful of tunes that were superstar slamming|0
im very disappointed in this cd save your money this does nothing for those who are first timers of rush|0

the greatest appeal of orffs carmina burana is o fortuna it is among the most powerful and deep compositions of classical music there is a significant percentage of the fans of carmina burana who loose interest in the rest of the music they should not buy parts two and three of the trionfi nothing resembles o fortuna in catulli carmina nor trionfo di afrodite for the rest of us who like the sublimeness of the other scores in carmina burana catulli carmina and trionfo di afrodite has little to offer none of the scores have the depth power nor sweetness of any of the carmina burana scores it offers only sour notes operatic dialog and no memorable melodies|0
having had the privilege of singing with shaw on many occasions i know and honor him as a passionate choral technician and teacher who could always bring out better than the best in an amateur group  nearly all the choral directors ive ever sung under pull shawisms from their bag of tricks to improve pitch and accuracy  however in todays era where we can choose from a plethora of professional groups montiverdi singers tallis scholars dale warland singers etc sadly shaws recordings usually dont competeparticularly in his final years when he would hold his summer festivals in southern france attracting a huge flock of choral directors the recorded product released on a series of telarc recordings has been consistently mushy and lugubrious  this one in particular  the usually fine telarc engineers should be ashamed as well as their marketers who where obviously trying to ride the shaw band wagon as far as they couldthe barber agnus dei for which ive yet to find a satisfying recording sounds like the singers are submerged in molasses  the tempo is unbelievably slow and there is a total lack of clarity in the inner parts  i recently was driving through colorado during the npr fundraising week and heard a pair of wellmeaning npr announcers slavering over this recording  i thought i was going to pukemuch better recordings exist of the gorecki paumlrt and martin  with due deference to the master i wouldnt touch this recording with a tenfoot pole  if you simply must purchase shaw recordings stick with the larger choral repertoire  youre guaranteed to get good choral singing and excellent soloists but usually coupled with a lessthanelectric performance|0
rush is known to deliver a great album everytimethis is no exception to there legacy and how big they areso glad they mad it to the hall of famethis is a masterpiece of an albumi would say there concept record|1
to put it simply pink floyd hit a vein with this one  you feel yourself rise and this is most of the album fall with the protagonist a rock star named pink  pink goes through the pain of losing a father to  war of a fascination repulsion to sex and addiction to heroin his wife  leaving and ultimately putting himself on trial for the emotional wreck he  has made of himself  although a few of the songs are a little weak at  times they are counterbalanced by songs with heavy emotional musical  impact  cuts like comfortably numb run like hell and the trial take an  album that would be great without them and bring it into an entirely  different level  overall the wall is a triumph of songwriting and  composition the likes of which will probably never be equalled again|1
i have never had such a strong reaction to any stand up comedian as i did when i first saw brian regan on a showtime special in the early 1990s he had me rolling on the floor from the very start read the reviews that follow and there is a good reason why 999 of them give brian regan 5 stars he is an absolute riot  his humor is clean and he relates childhood and personal stories much like bill cosby used to in his early days the only negative is that his characterizations are funny too but you cant see them on a cd however that problem has been solved because brian has a dvd out now and it can be purchased from his website brianregancom there are only a few really good stand up comedians out there and brian regan is the best of the best|1
this is one of the most awesome comedy cds ever i put it in and i was laughing so hard i couldnt catch my breath another reason its great is its completely clean so anyone can listen to it it is totally worth the money so just buy it you wont be sorryif you like this cd buy brian regans comedy special on dvdbrian regan standing up|1

what was i thinking  blomstedt conducting the youthful energetic schubert  the orchestra plays well and the sound is good  however the conducting most specifically the tempi for the final movements of each symphony is pathetically slow and plodding  these early symphonies of schubert the final movements particularly have the exuberance and sprightliness of youth when played right  abbado has it in abundance  even bohm has it pretty good  blomstedt doesnt begin to have it  these final movements sound more like the slow speed of very advanced age feeble and lethargic  so if thats you cup of geritol go for it  but no hurry theyre not going anywhere fast|0
the first time i heard brian regan i just howled and this is something youll read in almost all of his reviews he is amazingly clean i can play this cd for my 5yearold and 8yearold and enjoy it on different levels brian comes across as the ultimate loveable idiot which is both hilarious and endearing after hearing dane cook recently which i also bought i can hear many similarities with a major exception being that dane relies a lot more on the pottytalk at times his stuff almost sounds like a brian regan homage but he is much more biting brian is perfect listening when you want something thats simply silly while still exploring the serious depths of human stupidity|1
i currently own 6 versions of mozarts requiem and ill review them here1 my current favorite is bohmsmozart requiem it possesses all the virtues of karajan or bernsteins with the recording quality enjoyed by abbados highly recommended backstory i though six versions were enough then a friend criticized this recording saying bohm conducts mozart as if he were brahms well that i thought is exactly the how i like it if you dont well then skip this one as well as the bernstein and the karajan2 my former favorite was bernsteinsmozart  requiem  mclaughlin m ewing hauptmann bayerischen rundfunks bernstein it is also availabe in a box set of bernsteins recordings of mozart which id heartily recommend to anyonemozart the late symphonies great mass in c minor requiem box set i cannot say that this is perfect but it is the way i like to hear the requiem slow stately and solemn i dont think anyone excited about the principles of period performance is going to like it but i believe if mozart had the resources available to a modern orchestra hed want to hear something like this3 about 15 years ago i decided to learn about classical music  not because i actually enjoyed it but because i wanted to be a cultural person one of the first recordings that i genuinely loved was karajansmozart requiem i actually prefer the music here to bernsteins it is even more beautiful and moving it hurts me to subordinate this to anything but unfortunately this recording is older and fuzzier than bernsteins the individual singing parts and instrumental lines are much clearer in the bernstein if you have a decent modern stereo system or fancy headphones you would want to hear the bernstein at least occasionally for its clarity also to be fair to bernstein there are moments where i prefer his version be careful if you live abroad this recording is also available with a byzantine icon on the cover but there is at least one other recording by karajan of mozarts requiem which is not the same as this one and i dont own pay attention to the names of the soloists and youll be fine dg seems dedicated to fooling people into purchasing multiple editions of the same recording4 abbadomozart  requiem  mattila mingardo schade terfel berlin phil abbadothis recording is by far the most clear if you want to hear the distinct parts the instrumentation as if you were standing on the podium this is the recording for you it is played faster than i like but it retains most of the emotional power comparing this recording to bernsteins is very instructive im sure abbado took fewer liberties and purists will prefer this one5 in brilliant classicsmozart edition complete works 170 cd box set it is conducted by nicol matt and performed by various dutch artists the music is not recorded as well as the bernstein or abbado above and it is taken too fast yet i still enjoy listening to this one occasionally for contrast6 gardinermozart requiem  bonney von otter blochwitz w white gardiner this is a recording only a mother  or a very serious enthusiast of period performance  could love it is played far too fast the instrumentation is much too thin i cannot enjoy this and i dont think ive sat all the way through it more than twice notice that the enthusiastic reviewers of this one talk about accuracy and authenticity and so on rather than beauty or power well thats their thing and im glad they have a recording to love but it doesnt work for mei hope to consider more as my collection grows if you have a favorite or one that you think id like please let me know in the comments|0
i was hoping for more of the flash gordon type music from the old bw serials with buster crabbe  i played this cd once  now it is collecting dust somewhere|0
youre either gonna love rush or hate them and this review wont change that but i will say this if you once loved rush but lost your faith some time in the late 80s and 90s do yourself a favor and give this one a listen it rocks its beautiful theres nothing the least bit cringeworthy on it and no one raps its a masterful achievement that stands alongside their best previous work the production is a modern which may be a distraction for some people who are tired of hearing music saturated in plugins but unlike most radio rock it doesnt sound like it came out of the same batch of presets that taylor swift uses at times along their evolution rush have adopted elements from the popular music of the time with mixed results while some of the songs demonstrate a harder recentera metal edge they never seem out of place or forced the bands sounds like theyre entirely comfortable in the style theyve created here the whole album has been growing on me since the first listen and i hum the songs all day haters are gonna hate but thats never stopped these guys i dont know how many more albums theyve got in them but if this is the last one its a heck of a way to go out the last few songs are especially beautiful|1
i bought this album because a bunch of old dads have itthe cover is haunting but why werent the beatles wearing any shoes while listening to this album i kept staring at their feet on the cover does john lennon have a foot fetishwhat did the beatles have against mr mustard why was he sooo mean did he gun down mr lennonanother question why didnt ringo ever play the drums in front of the band why was he always in the back everyone knows he was the best he was the only thing that kept the band together he bought the pot he wrote the songs he drummed he stabbed a baby why did the beatles hate babies why did they take a picture of themselves stabbing babies and then throw it away why go through all that trouble did george write a book of dead baby jokeswhy dont you listen to some grownup albums like europop by eiffel 65 blue da ba deemy fav song ever next to chocolate starfish and the hotdog flavored waterwhat a bunch of crackheads|0
to hell with the naysayers this album is another incredible offering from the holy triumvirate yes we rush fans will defend them but its not because we cant help ourselves its because rush is worthy of that kind of respect and admiration there arent many bands that can carry on for all these years and still infuse so much spark creativity and vigor into their new music  almost as if its a new band just bursting at the seams with vitality not to mention a band that gives its audience its moneys worth by playing about 3 hours of music at every show it shouldnt be difficult for anyone to understand why we love them so mucha couple of years ago we were given two new songs  caravan and bu2b  which my ears got very used to over that period of time so much so that it was a bit difficult to start wrapping my ears around the new versions on the album admittedly theyre not that different but enough so that the changes were noticeable at the time the single versions were released we had no idea what they were up to but the songs stood up well on their own neverthelesswith the story of clockwork angels coming into focus caravan and bu2b are the start of the journey for our protagonist i also like the way some of the tracks on this album run into each other its a nice touch that isnt used very often anymore even in progressive rock the title track is the longest on the album but is certainly one of the stronger pieces if caravan and bu2b set the stage for the story clockwork angels helps to kick it along nicely with a 68 riffthings really heat up with the anarchist a fairly heavy song geddys bass sound on this one reminds me of the sound chris squire would tend to get out of his bass in yes  lots of treble with a lot of punch geddys whisper of the pedler in the beginning of the song what do you lack is eerily haunting as well i like the way this song is told from the point of view of the anarchist character himself as it contrasts well with the bulk of the lyrics which are told from the protagonists point of view carnies is another nice heavy number which leads up to the midalbum halo effect a nice shorter piece that serves as a bridge between the longer pieces on either half of the albumseven cities of gold is one of my favorites the first new song id listened to since headlong flight as it so happens the wreckers is a little more accessible sounding and the strings add a nice touch toward the end especially headlong flight itself showcases the bands talent and virtuosity quite well i remember some criticism over the lyrics to this one when it came out as a single in april to the effect that it wasnt up to pearts standards but when you take this in the context of the story it fits quite well its a little more direct than some of the other lyrics but that matters little  this song is fast heavy and gets the blood pumping try listening to this one on your way to work in the morning i can almost guarantee you will not need any caffeine just remember to watch your speed many rush songs tend to make me drive faster bu2b2 is more of an interlude than a song as it is only about a minute and a half but the spare sounding strings are excellent and offer a nice musical contrast to some of the other material wish them well has a great melody and proves that geddy has quite a vocal range i wasnt sure how well the garden worked as a rush song on first inspection but believe me this is pure rush   progressive meloncholy and yet uplifting  a track that elicits true feelings of kinesthesia particularly in the chorus its not as heavy as some of the other songs but it caps off the album nicely both lyrically and musicallyto my fellow rush fans heres to yet another fine album from the boys naturally were looking ahead to the upcoming tour later this year heres also hoping the next album is a little sooner than five years |1

i find that even among michael w smith fans this album is overlooked which is a real shame  its definitely an 80s album but its songs are timelessthe only song id heard from this album before i bought it was the last one hosanna  still it has some great moments on it talking about everything from god forgiving our sin to two great songs about jesus return  there are also pure praise songs songs about relationships and two instrumental cutsgranted the musical style of the album sets it clearly in the 80s  but its still a fun album to listen to with great messages  all fans should get this album|1
genevive williams opinion of this record is not one anybody should accept remember folks this album was performed live at the tearing down of the berlin wall in 1990 this recording is a must own  if youve never  heard it be ready to play it a thousand times and that goes for the kids  too  genevieve i disagree 100|1
all the songs i cherished as a child  raffi is awesome i cant wait until my son is old enough to sing along with me|1
growing up during the 80s i saw almost all of these shows listed on this cd  i specifically bought this cd for one theme in particular hardcastle  mccormick which i could not find anywhere else short of buying the series dvd set  how disappointing it was to find that most of the themes on this cd were not complete but instead snippets that last 1 minute give or take 515 seconds or so  and the sound quality on some of these sounds like someone put a cassette recorder up to a tv to capture the song  not what i wanted when paying 30 bucksthis cd would be a good buy at 10 bucks or less  any more and you are getting robbed  now i must decide to keep this cd or try and sell or trade it to recoup my loss  i was going to buy another of the tv theme cds but now no way|0
i did not receive the cd with this cover i have a boleros in pastels where 1 disc wasmissing i must have been billed but dont find it i was about to buy it from the musicon batanga that plays this album|0
this is not the raiders i grew up hearing  mark lindsay the fabulous original lead singer of the band is not a part of this remake  his strong vocals are sorely missed heredont waste your money on this one rather buy the real thingpick up recordings from the band when lindsay was still with them 1972 and before|0
this cd is not the same album i owned on vinyl or audiocassette the original american help album was both a beatles album and a soundtrack album what happened to the instrumental tracks that ken thorne composed  those great instrumental tracks that were on the lp are missing one of the central plot elements of help was the satirical slant spoofing the james bondspy phenomenon of that period the music that ken thorne composed or adapted is now missing the beatles songs interlaced with thornes instrumentals made for a great musical experience from the film i objectively can only rate this based on the absence of this fantastically nostalgic material this cover is not as good as the original in my opinion the original was more intricate and detailed and was truly more a product of the film and the times |0
did yever notice that most comics who are reduced to saying did yever notice arent very funny  brian regan never says it  well not quitelike any good comedian regan points out the foibles of the commonplace mixed in with some autobiographical anecdotes but with original subjects for both  hes not talking about the bad food on the airlines or purging the dramas of his childhood in lieu of therapyinstead he talks about the silly the stupid and the absurd in such a way that even as i cringe at how similar his childhood and mine are he and i could have been in the same little league team i have to laugh because he is spot on in his telling of it and he plays himself as a wise fool thinking a little too much about mundane which makes him appear all the more foolishthere are no messages here  no moralizing no politics  blissfully no current events  i dont know that anyone could call this timeless but hes successfully tapped a very funny vein of humor  if youre up for laughing at  the science fair youre in for a treat|1
while i can see that there is room for improvement this album is a good listen  specifically the vocals are quite impressive  the singer sounds like michelle branch or avril lavigne but with more power behind it more range and a certain quirkiness thats very charming  songs like im so sick fully alive cassie im sorry and breathe today are worth the price of the album in my opinion  im not a fan of faithbased lyrics and there are some here but i think it can be overlookeda little life experience and maybe less or no focus on christianity would greatly help give the lyrics a more wellrounded adultthoughtful sound  also this band needs bass badly and to tighten up  their sound in general  overall though the hooks are immediate on their debut this is a very good start|1
the hype is they spent four years working on the beatles catalog to remaster it yeahright what were they doing smoking dope and taking lsd to while away the time because while revolver is a great beatle album this new cd remaster does not make a big difference over the one issued in 1987 on cd the liner notes to the new remaster must have been written in ten minutes or cut and pasted from information on the internet  and the bonus in this overhyped remastered beatle cd is a video that you can only play on your computer  save your money and wait till this disc ends up in the used cd binoh one minor difference is that on this cd  mccartney must have told the remastering bozos to boost the bass sound and finally why couldnt they put the mono mix on this cd  too answer cause apple is a greedy orgazniation |0
the guitar skills from slash do not disappoint and myles kennedys voice pares well with the feel of the music|1
i got this set for christmas and overall i was pleased with the box set my only complaint is that the single comfortably numb is edited and is not the full version you get rogers verses and then daves and then the song goes directly to the guitar solo amd done so i was definitely not too happy with that it seems that the other songs are the full versions minus the sound effects which was fine with mei think the price of the set is a little on the high side for just 3 singles a spindle a poster and an edited vesion of comfortably numb i could do without the spindle and please give me the full version of cn regardless if thats what was released to the general public over in japan|1
this is the dregs  i have listened to a lot of indian classical music in my life and i can tell you this is the pits  there is nodepth no feeling and no great amount of skill either only some plodding and learned exercises that this fellow learned from someone  i was waiting for the cd to end from the minute i heard the first few notes  the only thing stopping me was the hope that things might get better btw if you think i am making this up ask around in indian classical music circles whether anyone has heard of this chap  i have nothing against him indeed the liner notes mention that he is blind and has taken great pains to learn many indian instruments  that is admirable but not enough to warrant publication let alone praise  it seems there is also a recording of sitar and surbahar by him  i wouldnt go near it with a barge pole  i got this recording because i had never heard dilruba and wanted to hear it  i should have stuck with never having heard any dilruba at least that way i would have had a positive albeit imagined idea of it  now whenever i think of dilruba this trash comes to mind  do yourself a favor accept that there is no good dilruba recording in circulation and listen to some good sarangi instead  go for ram narayan  i know it is not the same instrument but it is an infinitely better buythe man is a genius  and if you are ever tempted by the sitarsurbahar album realize that this guy is an unknown in those instruments as well and listen to imrat khans surbahar and nikhil banerjee or vilayat khans sitar  i wanted to give this album zero stars but the lowest allowed was one star|0
carlin used to be funnier he has no delivery he has quit being a comedian and just makes observations however the crowd in the backround seemed to enjoy it|0
the record is just too slow and morbidly somber for me to take in one listen  its worth hearing for any serious pink floyd fan as i think some the ideas are good and very well recorded but its definitely missing the musical contributions that the other members  the final cut for me has gotten some second listens splitting up the tracks and hearing them mixed in play lists of various floyd related music|0
i love pink floyd  this album is their greatest  the lyrics are wonderful and the music  rocks big time  is anybody out there  bands dont rock like this anymore|1
this album is absolutely wonderful if you love china or are interested in them this is a great piece to start with itll give you some insight into how they felt during the revolution and you can experience all kinds of different styles of music on this one album its fantastic and i highly recommend it to anyone ive been listening to it for years now and i love it every time|1
this is their best record since 1991s roll the bones these guys continue to stretch the boundaries of what a three piece progrock band can do this is a concept record and while the concept is rather obtuse who cares  the music excells at every turn why arent these guys a shooin for the rock n roll hall of fame |1
tthis album is another rip offit contains a mini documentrythat is alli travel to asia ofteni will now buy a counterfit copyamazon why are you selling this rip off|0
yet another fine set of music from rush in general they continue along the path they were going with snakes  arrows  rich production beefy sound solid in every way and compelling lyrics i highly recommend this album|1
raffi rocksthis is what i played back in the day when my kids were coming uparound the mid 80s got it for my granddaughter who is one year oldshe loves it guess raffi still rocks|1
i had this album as a kid and i thought it was great but it kind of got me down because its mood is heavy roger waters is on a bad trip anyway my father hadnt been killed by the japanese and i wasnt dropping bad acid either so i didnt want to share the angst i ended up giving the album away to my brother which coincided with the start of his problems with society|1
my daughters grew up listening to raffi tapes and videos i was excited to purchase these for a recent baby gift his childrens music is wonderful|1
just awesome  myles and slash sound great like they have been together for years  the conspirators are clearly in the groove as well  great soundn great energy|1
i was very disappointed with this cd because most all of the pieces are strange arrangements of the pieces and not the normal renditions  i say normal because most of these pieces are known by versions played on modern instruments  the disk should have been labeled arrangements and the amazon description should have included that information  add to this annoyance the fact that the arrangements themselves were bizarre  i was certainly not expecting many of these chestnuts to be adapted to a brass ensemble  so dont get this if you want a compilation of baroque chestnuts played as we normally hear them|0
when i discovered that a reissue of old waiing souls music was available i immediately purchased it  i expected to listen to some wonderful undiscovered gems  i was suprised  the good news is the music is engineered by scientist and includes some key dubs  the bad news is this is not some of the bands better material i presume the back up band is the roots radics  the souls have recorded some excellent albums with the radics but this is not one of them  the songwriting and the music both are weak  there are some bright spots however one highlight is the song time is important this is an awesome song and has a very uplifting beat  unfortunately this is one of the few high points on this recording  trojan records threw this package together quickly and it shows  for instance the dub that follows the opening tune face the devil is why no dub not face the devil dub  why follow a song with the dub to a differnt song  it doesnt make sense  and the recording sounds as though it was mastered under the muddier waters of the carribean seamy advice to those who are looking for a good wailing souls album  skip this one  if your looking for other excellent recordings by the wailing souls but already own firehouse rock buy bredda gravalicious or their new release equality or their 1976 self titled album which has just been rereleased  if you buy one of these albums instead you wont be asking yourself what the devil did i spend my money on this one for respectmark homebody groesbeck|0
the wall has so many great songs its just amazing the only downfall is the pricewal mart sells it for 36 crazyness i bought the live version for only 15 but it isnt as good the wall is a must have thojohn beam you dont know how stupid you sound saying classic rock is bad if classic rock never exsistedthe musix you like wouldnt be anything without those influences get out of the mtv world man|1
reviews for music are useless this is in my opinion rushs best release yet does that make it so no the musicianship is certainly upped a notch or two beyond snakes and arrows the songwriting on this record is really great as well some of the solos shine ala bravado open secrets etc apparaently recorded as throwaways alexs best work is done like this i feel the guitar shines on this record but the entire effort is welldone the band was careful this time around to step up their playing and it shows compared to snakes and arrows but doesnt feel contrived or dream theateresque sophistication for the sake of sophistication|1
sub par performances by average professional musicians made the mistake of buying this after hearing 1 cut on a radio station kcsm in california|0
if you want to fall asleep to some really lush strings absurdly slow tempi and almost in audible brass then buy this recording when i was in high school i remember returning my copy of the vinyl of this performance of the 4th symphony by ormandy and purchasing the glorious munchboston performance available currently only from bmg japanese victor as an importi purchased this cd thinking that as i had aged and presumably become more tolerant of diversity and interpretation that somehow i had grown to appreciate ormandys uniqueness nope its still too slow and tedious ormandy does to tempi what bernstein did but without the creativity and passionsave your money buy almost anyone elses 4th symphony|0
okay lets get it straight i listen to this cd from the florissant valley county library only once because all of the songs are totally boring i dont think ill buy this cdmaybemy email adress is thebeatlesfantanyayahoocom|0
when my love of the civil war era was first kindled back in the early 90s this was one of the more enjoyable forms of my learning through the music of that most singular time in our historysome of the reviews here criticize rusty mcneils singing but she has a sort of grandmotherly homespun quality to her voice that made the music even more authentic for me and which brought me back more strongly to the mid19th centurymany of these songs i have heard nowhere else and those particular songs seem to tell the story of the civil war with even more authenticity than the more wellknown piecesmy original audiotapes were either worn out or lost so long ago that i cant remember so i am looking forward to revisiting old friends through newer technology|1
i spent 39 years teaching music at the college leveland 15 of them as the choral conductorhad never even heardof dollone  his choral pieces are firstrate and given fine performances on this recording|1
this concept album by the immortal trio rush is an amazing comeback from the last two studio albums i was looking for a song or two from this album to keep me connected  to one of my favorite bands ever and was blown away it is heavier which was not something i was looking for but technically it is astounding for me geddy lee stands out like the virtuoso i know him to be with fills everywhere and a frenetic pace that belies his age alex and neil are the standard awesome as well of course the concept itself the story of a young mans adventures and woes is interesting but the music is catchy riffdriven and addictive there should be at least two radio hits out of this but we all know that rush doesnt get radio play sad anyway i have listened to nothing but this album for three weeks and i live it more every time i hear it standout songs are the title track clockwork angels and headlong flight wow buy it immediately if you havent already|1
ha  it even happened to the best  the beatles as many pop groups do could not match their debut masterpiece  pound for pound this is a lightweight album in length and depth of material  the no 1 reason is that the group had years of club playing in hamburg to develop their early stuff that stood toe to toe with the covers of american rock and roll they could play in their sleep  and they picked the cream of the crop of those covers for the first album  wtbs only show stoppers are till there was you  money although georges roll over beethoven really shows that once his heart belonged to rock  roll  most of their original orginals had already been released as singles or the first lp  by the time wtb was released mr lennon  sir mccartney had already written  please please me i saw her standing there do you want to know a secret from me to you she loves you  i want to hold your hand  the only standout originals on wtb are little child an underated lennon gem and all my loving a paul classic  i wanna be your man was given away to the stones  as great as their version is ringo does the song justice here with a cool reverb heavy vocal over a rockin effort by the rest of the bandamazingly the boys rebounded in 1964 and lennon  mccartney would each develop a unique sound without yet straying too far from rock  roll at an incredibly prolific paceuntil capitol decides to release a best of 196364 cd set youll need this to complete your collection|0
pure disappointment  i really cant believe with the caliber of talent in this band this is what they turned out|0
whats not to like very worshipful god honoring music the vocals and guitar are a beautiful combination youll love it|1
among the countless recordings of these masterworks this version is certainly no gem i find kenneth gilberts technique dry and uninspiring and coupled with the harpsichord which lacks any dynamics makes this rendition an exercise of utter boredom the overall pace of these recordings are static there is no motion the tempo is kept at an even walk for both the preludes and fugues the impression i get is that mr gilbert is simply bored and finds playing these pieces a chore if one had to settle on a single version of the well tempered clavier one can certainly do better than to choose this set|0
this recording would be useful for singers planning to perform brel as a warning of what to avoid when singing these exquisite songs glibness and unnecessary flourish  no matter how talented the voice  as well as the attempt to put too much of a personal stamp on brel are deadly mistakes the songs of brel communicate beautifully for themselves if the singer is grounded in emotional directness and authenticity|0
i bought this album after having heard volver a los 17 for the first time thinking it was violetta who sang it on geraes when i received the album i was shocked by the horrible quality very thin with very faint instrumental tracks too sad|0
there is a deeply spiritual quality in bachs music that brings me closer to heaven every time i listen this quality is present with such abundance in the bach of the elderly arrau and kempff that the music reached deeply into my soul and put me into tears at timeimho it takes a very refined sense of control to balance the multiple voices in bachs polyphonic keyboard music on one hand each line needs to be given its due independence and prominence and yet at the same time together they should sound at peace with one another harmonically hewitts playing is usually muddy in the bass lines as compared to the clarity achieved by glenn gould arrau or kempff the latter two even did it on unmodified pianos hewitts playing also lacks the forementioned finesse control that caused the louder passages to sound noisy and nervous also while her phrasing is usually very good her shaping may be considered overdone for baroque keyboard music|0
this dvd was marked universal to be able to play on any dvd player  instead they sent me a region 2 version and in the us we are region 1  so now i am stuck with a product that i cannot use  there was an option that if i could copy the disc to another that the problem would be solved we tried this but the copy was too corrupted to watch  so i will be returning this dvd and getting my money back  hopefully  so much for doing business overseas|0
i wasnt to happy with this soundtrack the quality of the recordings are not great the music is scrambled all over the place  it left me dissapointed i am a huge grease fan thats the saddest part|0
did not feel relaxed or sleepy it is a lovely piece but it did not relax me enough to put me into a sound sleep|0
dangerfields worst material  absolute waste of money rodney is probably turning in his grave from embarrassment  im tired of writing|0

okay quick do you remember all of the twelve labors of hercules   i sure as heck couldnt which is  one of the nice things about odds bodkins oral version of the myth of hercules  bodkin is a well  known storyteller particularly here in new england who accompanies himself on twelve string  guitar  thats one other nice thing about this cd set that it is reminiscent of how these stories and  legends would have been presented when they were first being concocted though the teller would  probably have been blind and playing a lute or somethingfor the purposes of this setting bodkin imagines hercules has died and hades and persephone prevail  upon him to relate the story of the twelve labors before he can leave the underworld  here they are as  listed at the perseus digital library labor 1 the nemean lion  labor 2 the lernean hydra  labor 3 the hind of ceryneia  labor 4 the erymanthean boar  labor 5 the augean stables  labor 6 the stymphalian birds  labor 7 the cretan bull  labor 8 the horses of diomedes  labor 9 the belt of hippolyte  labor 10 geryons cattle  labor 11 the apples of the hesperides  labor 12 cerberusbodkin mixes thrills and humor in the telling and also being socially conscious has an ulterior  motive here the whole epic is sort of structured around hercules trying to learn how to control his  rage  you may recall that the labors were assigned to him as a way of purging his conscience after he  accidentally murdered his family in a herainduced blinding rage  i guess this is odds bodkins way  of preventing another school shooting a noble enough causend for the most part he keeps it fairly  subtle though he does go a mite overboard when he has hercules finally get control of his fury only  after spending a few years crossdressing youll have to give it a listen to find out and getting in  touch with his feminine sidehercules does lead a pretty violent life so the recording is not suitable for young children but any  teenage boys who watch wrestling are certainly old enough for this  you dont have to inform them  that theyre also getting a healthy dose of their cultural heritage in the processgrade  b|1
brian regan is just like jim carrey if you miss old jim carrey material then brian regan is for youthe first four or five tracks are really funny then its just okay but it still deserves four stars|1
rush is definitely in my top 3 favorite bands sadly though this album just does not do it for me|0
i only had to listen to this album once or twice before it became one of my alltime favoritesi had not previously been a pink floyd fan but i previewed the tracks here on amazon and liked what i heard i promptly bought the albumthere is a reason the wall is a classic it is one of the best concept albums ever madethe best thing about this album is that it makes you think while simultaneously enjoying the quality music that it has to offerthe listener is taken through the exploits of pink floyd who because of several factors in his life has become alienated from the world unable to have a real relationship with anyone thus he builds himself a symbolic wall that shields him from the worldone of the things that makes this a good album is the fact that many of the tracks are not very long at all pink floyd is able to tell their character pinks story without becoming too wordy or trying to overexplain what is happeningthe music on this album is unparalleled short though many of the trackss may be they are catchy pleasant to the ears and highqualitya musthave for anyones music collection|1
im 15 when i was 7 i didnt know what pink floyd was didnt think id be listening to it well i am and it sure is better than all the crap that these stupid generic rappers are churning out today who have no talent at all also if your going to be writing a review on a respectable website like this you should learn to spell esp if you think youre so grand you wish you could play guitar like david gilmour its people like you who have no appreciation for any form of art whatsoever and are an embarassment to societyeric b|1
i cannot like this as it did not download i followed procedure but cannot find it in my itunes thanks|0
first of all buy this record right now and then come back to read the reviews and see what a great album youve just bought now lets talk about it the wall is a masterpiece unequalled it shows pink floyd at their very best  roger waters lyrics on isolation and alienation are terrific the music is absolutely wonderful another brick in the wall mother young lust hey you comfortably numb run like hell the list goes on and on milestones songs that are part of public conscience and of course mr david gilmour listen to gilmours solos and youll find out why he is one of the greatest guitar players to ever grace the face of earth mother and comfortably numb have probably the most beautiful guitar solos ever if you never heard anything of the wall you wont regret youre buying the best album ever recorded|1
as a reviewer wrote on january 12 2000 why not the mono mix for this special rereleasethe music is 5 stars but 1 star for the uninspired release|0
please do not waste your money on this sound track  it is almost as bad as the movie with one exception not having to watch it while the sound track is playing|0
that being said this is still better than most other albums but this is shockingly mediocre especially from a band who two years earlier were writing epics like strawberry fields and a day in the life most songs here feature weak annoying melodies and druggedout throwaway lyrics and uninspired vocals their heart wasnt into this at all and it shows maxwells silver hammer is pleasant at best i want you is inexcusably long and the medley is excruciating slop if you can sit through all that though you will hear two of harrisons finest compositions it was those two that earned the album its 2 stars|0
in my opinion mr dvorak has conducted this pieces so fast that the only good reason for it was to force them all into one cd i havent got any other record that has all 4 in 1|0
wonderful for home and car great to sing to great to dance to our boys love raffis songs our littlest seems to love the songs with his band included or children singing the best|1
for those who own the wall in their original vinyl pressing or on the various cd releases since the 1980s let me tell you that this 180 gram vinyl remastering is by far the best audio version ive heard of this album the 180 gram lps i bought came from the uk a country that in my humble opinion along with the japanese and the germans manufacture the best quality vinyl in the world the vinyl is extremely quiet and the sound is full  meaning its neither bassy nor  tinny  it is well balanced and i hear instruments previously buried in the early lp pressings and in the cds though you can adjust your tone controls to your liking  set mine on flat  you can still hear the 15khz tone from the tv in the track one of my turns highly recommended if you can afford it and if you cant put it on the credit card before theyre all gone and then end up on auction sites for a 3 digit sum|1
you say you wanna laugh  laugh really hard  well this is the cd for you  youll pay a few bucks less than i did but youll laugh just as hard  brian is a funny funny man  the only downside is that you cant see him doing the material  if nothing else pick up the cd to find out what my review title means|1
sourced from inferior two track masters widely used and plagiarised for its multi release on numerous cheap budget record labels from the 1970s onwards the sound is poor look elsewhereeverest represented the peak of recorded sound back then and this set as with other belock recordings well worth getting but only as outlined below otherwise do not waste your money on cheap reissues though i notice this isnt exactly cheap  insult to injuryto get back to the original audiophile quality of the recordings you have to invest in the collectible vanguard reissue where the original 3 track 35 mm master tapes have been transferred via lovingly restored 1960s valve electronics to 20 bit sbm cds the sonic results are light years ahead of this cheap bucket job which i consider an insult to the belock recorded legacy as a shortlived but brilliant stereophonic record label between 1958 and 1962the performances are middle of the road without being historically informed krips direction and view of the music isunerringly right  as you would expect his mozart cycle with the concertgebouw for philips is a reference recording  and he was used to working with quality orchestras in this case the lso was as now one of the top symphony orchestras in the world in particular the lso strings have always been admired here in unbuttoned mood with recording dates outside of the pressures of the busy concert season we have joyful eager and sensitive playing light years away from the hard driven bolshy germanic readings which seem to dominate from karajan to solti  krips intelligent performances are also superior to the current vogue for hip from the likes of gardiner and arghhh norrington  the thing to look for is musicianship  not historicity whatever that is  and nice sound  not scratchy strings  and these recordings are loaded with superior muscianship instrumentals and lovely strings the beethoven orchestra is quite small compared with its later romantic counterparts so a monumental scale if it is to be achieved must be done within these restricted means the everest recording values authentically give a realistic audio picture that is familiar to anybody who has listened to the symphonies live in a concert hall this is infinitely preferable in my view to sonically bloated recordings which followed utilising a regiment of microphones 16 track or more mixed down to 2 track masters even socalled authentic recordings using period instruments are so extensively cosmetically engineered as bear no comparison to what the concert goer would hear even in the sweet spot of a great auditorium in a centre seat about 10 rows back costing about 100 one might as well have stuck microphones inside gardiners musical instruments given the adrenalin steroid pumping sound of his recent live cycle and so it goesthankfully with this everest recording you know where you stand in the real worlda world that has drifted away in most modern recordings so if you value a traditional concert hall sound get this  but not in this edition which is a betrayal of the original audiophile source and intentionalthough some 35mm belock recordings have been transferred to dvdaudio and even sacd classic records we have now probably come to the end of what can be done with the original aging analogue film masters so this is it the legacy that has been preserved by vanguard and classic records there are also the original bluesilver lps from that era if you can get them mint again not cheap but to my knowledge the beethoven cycle came too late for release on audiophile quality vinyl as by the end of 1961 belock instruments had sold off everest records its equipment and studio in new york going to mercury to become a budget label based in hollywoodtherefore for a great set of enjoyable performances recorded with the non pareil clarity of belocks state of the art 35mm recording process in a naturally wide and deep acoustic soundstage using traditional lr stereo and avoiding the over miked hard driven versions that abound then krips cycle is for youit will cost you about 500 or more on vanguard as a complete set  or 20 or more per individual disc  if you can find themdont buy this cheap rip off thinking you are getting a bargain you arent its a waste of money really this cd box set is a disgracego for the vanguard set and splash your cash|0
when will people realize that arrau used rubato in order to hide his kindergarten level technique i have played the fantasy impromptu for a decade already and what arrau does here is against the basic tenets of classical music he slows the passage every few bars and blurs his slips with pedal so people will call it romantic fantasy impromptu is a flowing piece with active passages in both hands  arrau turns this into some type of cocktail loungecabaret fest musiche does this over and over again in the etudes in liszt whenever a passage is difficultthere is no concensus involving arraus playing that can forever be substantiated by 30 amazon reviews taking into account that some times people who are passionate about a certain product put multiple postings not that i am saying this is the case here this is deceptive in the sense that many pianists including the great horowitz and another review here if that matters have been very critical of his playing now to be fair he was one of the more popular pianists especially in south america but this fact in and of itself has little relevancei established the fact that i am intimately familiar with the piece as a basis for my contention that arrau does not play chopin but rather arrau i could of course lay out pages of specific reasons for this  primarily bizzare indulgent use of rubato not playing what chopin writes etc the fact that he is one of the greatest liszt interpreters which i wholeheartedly disagree with does not address this particular chopin cdthe only way you could justify this playing is by validating the reciprocal  namely  that unlimited rubato slower than conventional tempi quirky reservations on numerous passages superficial romanticism is fine until that is established as legitimate playing i will continue to criticize this type of playing especially since there are so many pianists that have treated these pieces with more care loosely ashkenazy horowitz richter rubinstein moravec pollini and many moreof course the kissin review that claims he plays 4 times faster is hyperbole  but it fits the picture in sofar as it pertains to illustrating the ludicrous and entirely infantile level of technique  and again i cant accept the fallacious correlation between lack of technique and emotionno piece of classical music should condescendingly be called minor and to a larger extent a wonderful piece by chopin finally i dont comprehend the contention that arrau has some type of technical supernatural superiority that he hides from the public lest it be deemed superificial the only way one could know this is if people close to arrau secretly revealed his hidden abilities regardless in some pieces technical aptitude is an unambiguous requirement if chopin writes presto he means presto it is just impossible to take chopin etudes seriously without the necessary or close to necessary level of technique the other weird assertment is that there is a correlation between arraus reluctance to display technique as being a trigger to his increased emotion this argument doesnt hold water since there are pianists that have both technique and other attributesfor more authoritative versions please turn to moravec rubinstein ashkenazy|0
this band puts hard rock and a great voice together perfectly  its the next kittie metal scream to a great voice is pure talent  i will defently be buying more of their cds|1
with the type of career they had its easy to overlook this abomination but still it stains no one really cares about mcartneys emotional problems while recording this album the guys really needed some curly fries hot dogs and beer and a good listen to this album then they would have burnt the masters i know people might want to flame me but i challenge any one person to tell me this is their favourite beatles long player or that this any more than 10 as good as revolver look past your love for the artist and see this long player for what it is|0
the cd case is badly broken the music sometimes skips possibly because of some scratches on the cd i have never got a product of such a bad condition|0
i was slightly skeptical that they could top the first album and that one certainly is still one of my all time favorites but this one does deliver the goods  it is more diverse more complex and more of what i love about this group  i only hope they can add at least a couple more before they move on and take their place in rock history|1
be warned that this is a different packaging from the regular issue of this cd  it come in a large cardboard digipak that is larger than the norm and will not fit in a usual cd rack  it has no program notes or texts and comes instead with a  catalog advertising other releases of orthodox chant in the le chant du monde line  as for the performance chernushenko made another and better recording but both are outclassed by the valery polyansky recording on bmg also out of print  do not get the inferior russian pressings which have distortion at peak climaxes or the classic sveshnikov recording which also goes in and out of print|0
if you are a fan of elisabeth you need to own this cd  it is just lovely  her voice soothes my soul|1
if you think rush hasnt made a decent record since the 70sthink againneil peart geddy lee and alex lifeson have outdone themselves with their epic 19th studio album  the garden is the most beautiful song ever written period|1
rush has done something remarkable  in a career that includes some fine moments cuts like tom sawyer red barchetta yyz closer to the heart spirit of radio a somewhat hokey but inspiredinitsattempt 2112 and more recently convincing rockers like animate and far cry theyve put together an entire album encompassing much of their vision as a band delivering the essence of the philosophical message they have worked on for the better part of four decades depending on ones view rush has either crispedup its sound enough to make it newlyrelevant or discovered the essence of what its sound had been tending towards all along  whether turbocharged for the twentyfirst century or a distillation of key 70s and 80s sounds it doesnt matter  rush has made metal art  rush has delivered an intense slightly offcenter hardrockin concept album  with all band members around 60 rush has made what is going to have to register as one of the better  perhaps the best  rock album of the year  rush has handed longstanding fans and the newly interested an artifact that absolutely says this is what were all aboutits been a long long and radically uneven journey for the band  the talent has always been there  rock isnt classical music or even jazz  were not talking about supertrained musicians whose compositions are going to be taught in music schools across the country  geddy lee neil peart and alex lifeson can play however and every musician in rock knows it  the lines and grooves lee and peart provide in rushs rhythm section have long been totally unique few rock players can execute let alone imagine some of the lines they do  lifesons rhythmic and occasional solo tonalities are also inventive  they sit between andy summers or the edges background pastel rock guitar and eddie van halens and joe satrianis electric hero shred  rushs talent and an unquestioned sense for music provides powerful moments  the singles named above are examples  intellectual rockers from bastille day to free will to instrumentals like la villa strangiato are totally unique  surprisingly melodic and atmospheric bsiders from lakeside park caress of steel 1975 to cut to the chase counterparts 1993 to peaceable kingdom vapor trails 2002 give a sense of the dimensions of rushs sound  theyre more accessible than yes heavierhitting than pink floyd harder than the police and they provide strong moments  for the most part theyve always done so  after disappointing albums in the late 80s early 90s and then again in the late 90s after semirevivals like counterparts 1993 test for echo 1996 might be the worst rush album rush has grown  vapor trails 2002 was imperfect but often intense  snakes and arrows 2007 had a few clunkers the attempt to be pseudofolky on the larger bowl was just boring  generally it rocked though snakes and arrows spoke to the slightly intellectual heavyrocker thats always been rushs fan base  a lot of tracks bordered on the excellentnot all though and thats the problem  with rush for every time stands still the poppy yet nonetheless good tune from 1987s hold your fire theres a tai shan a lordknowswhattheywerethinking banal ode to a chinese mountain from the same album  and before fans react by saying that that was rushs bad synthey period a they made good music there too power windows 1985 has a number of strong cuts and b even in their oftfavored 70s protometal prog period rush could come up with some hokey stuff  the schmaltzy kungfu chinastereotype segues in passage to bangkok an otherwise great tune should do what  are we really supposed to remember cinderella man from farewell to kings 1977 as a great tune  jacobs ladder form permanent waves 1980 is seven and half minutes opus concerning what exactly  what do we do with at least half the songs from presto 1989 or three quarters of roll the bones 1991  have rushs live performances been so different from their studio cuts that the bands needs nine live concert albums never mind eleven greatest hits collections  the guys in rush  based on every interview and report ive seen  are modest selfeffacing direct and wellgrounded  however afraid to market their stuff they havent been  songwriting is sometimes a concernthis provides the rush dilemma  is rush a slightly offbeat chops band who sometimes hits the spot and sometimes doesnt marked as much by inconsistency as by real vision  or does rush in fact have a vision we  even guys like myself who really like them  dont always getive tended towards a blend of these perspectives  in the rockumentary beyond the lighted stage 2010 tracking rushs career smashing pumpkins billy corgan heaps oodles of praise on the band wondering where they fit into the pantheon of the stones the beatles and led zeppelin  they dont  despite having sales rivaling those bands rush never pushed the cultural fold in terms of capturing the atmosphere of the 1970s 80s or 90s and speaking to counterculture in its various forms and manifestations  agrave la the beatles and stones in the 60s or zeppelin in the 70s rush was never connected to a set of politics be they the peace movement the right to rock and give the finger to ones parent or even the right to drop out in a heavy lsdhash haze telling is a scene from beyond where lifeson as a teenager negotiates as in chats with with his parents about not finishing high school  hardly the screw em hard rock attitude  rush clearly rocked  even their first album 1974 packed a surprisingly heavy direct and sophistocated crunch  however rush rocked in a private way  rush combined many of the musical innovations from the 60s and 70s  primarily the idea that rock should be taken seriously  yet explored those innovations as music  culturally their impact was minimal  as sebastian bach from skid row whom i was pleasantly surprised to find out is a rush fan and super funny guy said rush was the kind of band who got you firedup about literature  they knew something  but what they knew you werent exactly surestill  and rush plays mostly one dynamic loud with angular nonfunky grooves  no one does or perhaps even can do song like red barchetta  no one busts into airplay rotation with tunes like far cry  the drum beat from tom sawyer is one of the most memorable moments in rock  rush is entirely key to the progressive movement and certain sectors of metal  certain tonal and rhythmic moments by lee peart and lifeson literally make you stand up and cheer  its hard not to be impressed by the overall effort in early concept albums like 2112  and if one really listens to some later work like signals 1982 there are good  really really good  moments  and they keep coming  rocking harder  snakes and arrows was quality  vapor trails was better than many give it credit for  until clockwork angels  that had spanned more than three decades of upanddown but nonetheless solid workhow rush got to clockwork angels is both hard to say and not  its hard to say because though the presentday rock industry is diverse rushs sometimes nave wow its just amazing what we can do with a guitar set of amps massive drum kit and some imagination can feel a touch out of place rock takes itself seriously and flights of fancy are oftdismissed as irrelevant  yet rush has made a serious serious album  elements  the best elements  from almost every phase of their career may be heard across clockwork angels twelve tracks  when rush is on point with its musical skills and has a clear sense of where it wants to go few bands pack more punch or are more fascinating  every song is good and indeed some of clockwork angels tracks are more than winners  caravan  out for nearly two years as a single  is a great great hard rocker  bu2b is hardcore its message of individuality is driven home with an unrelenting electric bassguitar counterpoint  the title track clockwork angels is as good as anything as the band has ever done its got super grooves good dynamics funky sounds tangible metal grit  halo effect is gorgeous  the garden  in a term not superoften associated with rushs music  is actually flatout beautiful its orchestral rush and it works  the wreckers is maybe the albums flattest tune  but its listenable  headlong flight and seven cities of gold are more were simply not gonna give up with our long complex grooves until you like em and some of em are gonna totally blow your mind champions  and the album transports a spirit of 1976 progressive hardhitting we can play were longhairs weve got big ideas while also having metal on our minds spirit to 2012  apparently today we talk about things like steampunk the aesthetic from movies and books like the golden compass evoked by rush on this album  today weve experienced things like grunge and classic rock revival nirvana pearl jam or lenny kravitz anyone  we have retro sensibilities  however the early twentyfirst century isnt so retro that one cant get away with things if they dont somehow sound new  rush hits all the buttons  in doing so rush has written the masterpiece of their careersince i bought my first rush album  moving pictures i got it as a used lp in a church basement sale as a fourteen year old  ive loved the band  my love for rush was often as much about what they were trying to do  create a fullymusicianly aestheticallyaccessible artistic rock which was still rock  as for what they actually did sometimes accomplish their goals sometimes not  i dropped out as a fan in the 90s  that had to do less with rush than rock i wanted to learn more so i studied music for a while and my rock interests took me to jazz  it was quite some number of years before i allowed myself to taste metal again  i was unsure if rush was still around i found out they were back a couple of years after vapor trails  since my midteens in the late 80s id always turned to each new album wondering if this is the one on which theyd fully realize their potential  would it be the album on which every track would rock the guys would never slide off into bad songwriting or overproduction and rush would find a way to deliver its admittedlyamateurish yet nonetheless relevant philosophical message enlightened individualism in a package both palatable yet intense  thats clockwork angels  it will mark the bands legacy its the album to put next to 2112 and moving pictures as the best of rush  indeed in simply being themselves rush actually convinces us the sounds they create  and ideas they see accompanying them  demand as much attention as those being produced by anyone else the members of the band claim theyve been up to the same thing all along  perhaps true  in any case with clockwork angels rush has given us a full hour of heavyhitting super wellplayed inventive music asking us to consider what we value in rock clockwork angels points to where rock has been and where it might go reminding us of the pleasures both intellectual and visceral we might have along the way  its an experience worth every minute one spends with it|1
a very good album spoilt by less than average sound recording outstanding musicianship intricate arrangements and production for the enthusiast only|0
rush have taken their time having put together clockwork angels over the course of the past several years  the first two tracks caravan and bu2b were both released as internet singles more than two years ago and have been a part of their live show for the same time period  both tracks have been slightly improved here with some added flourishes not found in the originals  to my ears rush has been on a bit of a creative comeback of late  i thought their last album snakes and arrows was their best in years and clockwork continues moving in the right direction  all of rush strengths are shown here revolving around a concept that will be eventually expanded into a novel  this album took a few listens to really click with me but i am really enjoying it now  there are a few tracks here headlong flight is a good example which rate right up there with the best the band has ever done  instrumentally the band as always is still on fire with all three guys showing off their chops throughout the disc  geddys vocals have changed a bit over the years but he still has good range and can belt it out  my one criticism with the production is the sound  as with many modern albums everything is compressed to death and comes out muddy on my system  one thing you do not want on a rush album is muddy sounding drums and unfortunately they are nearly as clear and crisp as they should be  hell some of the bands old 70s albums sound better than this  other than the sound issue i think this is a very strong release from rush  these guys defiantly still have it|1
out of 4 disks the 4th one does not work  the others have qlitches in them so that the sound comes in and goes out again and is hard to understandwould like to return this product and receive credit for the charge  it is not worth keeping unfortunately|0
sidi bou said is an london based rock or altrock 90s band and they released their debut album brooch in 1993 which in turn didnt sell so well and for good reasons too i wouldnt really hold it against sidi bou for its terrible delivery after all this was the period at when they were learning about themselves as artists finding their sound and growing into it the album itself starts of with a very mediocre track urge which really isnt promising at all the mixing of the track is all over the place the instrumentals is loud and tends to overshadow the lead vocals in pretty much the whole album from start to finish and to make it somewhat worse there are rarely any tracks that standout at all i would advise for all intent and purpose buy to purchase their second album first if you are curious about the band and havent yet heard any music from them the album brooch can bring a little pleasure to the ears but tends too lack a lot of enthusiasm overall|0
this magic flute is not quite a good version starts good but some arias are just poor sung choose another one|0
this is a pretty cool cd its all rock and a little bit of screaming plus theres some cool acoustic songs at the end of the cd the riffs are catchy as well as the lyrics you will definetly get into it and be movin to the beat i would say they will play this cd on the classic stations 2030 years from now haha get this cd|1
salonen and the la phil have been making a series of sonically spectacular 20bit recordings most of them needing corporate subsidy since they dont sell very well even in la for this recording of debussy staples the orchestra went to the todd ao studio in hollywood and the result is a fantastically detailed soundscape with enticing clarity and great impactmusically however i found little to appreciate for salonen who models himslf as a postmodern conductor it goes without saying that deep expressiveness and romanticism are taboo but here he seems to think that debussy is a stylistic zero aside from precise articulation this music has nothing to say  salonens tempos are slow on the whole but more than that they are shapeless events follow one another without any apparent joy or enthusiasm so for me this was a clockwork orange kind of experiencehip empty and apathetic|0
simply amazing even more so live the most amazing show ive ever seen went only knowing a handful of songs left in awe and speechless these men are true artists unbelievable|1
theyve really outdone themselves on this album theyre playing harder than theyve ever played and the arrangements are outstanding neil is absolutely destroying his drumsi personally want to thank producer nick raskulinecz for working with these guys and pushing them to play to their full potentialthe results speak for themselvesbtw i loved bu2b but the album version is even better than the original the title track is mind blowing and it amazes me how these guys can keep progressing and coming up with such great music|1
the quality of sound on this set is unacceptable at any price i was deeply disappointed there is nothing more to say|0
when one of the most dramatic statements in the history of music and art is belittled by the assertivness of pedantic musicology  acting here as a substitute for deep artistic feeling and understanding the outcome can only be disappointment and disappointment it is|0
before anyone sends me hate mail for giving this only one star let me just say that id give five stars to the film score for the godfather not to mention parts ii and iii just as soon as id give five stars for star wars or the sound of musicthe bad rating is not for the film score but for this cd which as of my typing this is the only available soundtrack of the godfather  i used to own this cd but i sold it because the sound is horrible and it only contains less than half of the music from the film  one would think that in this age of digitally remastered soundtracks with expanded tracks etc there would be one for one of the greatest films of all time  in fact here is only a very small list of film soundtracks which have been remastered and rereleased with the majority if not all of the music from their respective filmsstar wars  jaws  the sound of music  2001 a space odyssey  raiders of the lost arkmy advice to the many people who love this film score so much as i do is simply to be patient and hope that there will soon be a quality soundtrack release one which does not insult the ears or the intelligence of the listeners|0
i remember these guys from the 70s  used to like the first two albums found this 2 in 1 release in used bin and was quite pleased never heard of either album before but should still be a blast from the past played it through that night awful truely theres not one song id reccomend on the whole thing even wimpy simpering hair bands like poison or reo speedwagon at thier worst made better music than this perhaps if youre a die hard fan of this band you might like it but anyone else save your money|0
another amazing works by rush you could try to pick a bad song but good luck with that again i say rush rules |1
this was a christmas gift for someone and i had to give it to them with a crack in the case that came upon receiving it besides that the cd works great|1
kind of disappointed it is on the bottom of our list  the musicis kind of catchy but the lyrics are weak  just not what i rememberit as|0
i bought this cd expecting a whole lot from slashafter listening to it a couple of times iwas pretty depressed nothing extraordinary just plain not one song stuck out may hesitate to buy his next cd|0
i have been a big fan of the strings for some forty years now they are good about turning out quality projects some of their projects are better than others this being one of the othersthis cd had the songs but not nearly enough of the stings this cd project focused on vocals primarly i find this cd offended me for i really enjoy instrumentals especially by the strings i would have preferred an all instrumental cd i know it is hard to always please everyone and i can understand their situationrecommendation i would like to recommend this cd|0
i received this cd as a gift a few weeks ago from a friend i was a bit skeptical at first but decided to try it anyway this cd is great the first two tracks talk you through how to use the cd and give you great techniques for breathing i like track 3 because its only 10 minutes which helps a lot with my busy schedule its already helped me sleep better and feel better during the day highly recommended|1
i have been a fan since 1978 when i first bought 2112 on vinyl  i sort of lost interest after moving pictures with all the synths but decided to buy tickets to their upcoming show in baltimore  i bought clockwork angels just to know the new stuff not expecting much  well i have to say this is now my favorite rush album  extremely heavy this sounds like it could have been released between permanent waves and moving pictures or even earlier  great arrangements interesting lyrics all around a powerhouse album  if you are a rush fan and are contemplating buying this do it  you will not be disappointed|1
anyone with the least bit of respect for movies and the music which accompanies them will stay as far away from this and other land before time sequel cds and movies james horners soundtrack and  lucasspielbergbluths original movie are the only forms of the land  before time which should be acknowledged as even being available|0
this is not a greatest hits collection as implied in the cds title  these are primarily recent recordings of some popular soul tunes originally recorded by other artists  ms knights voice is heavy and plodding  reminiscent of a drag queens not worth the near twentyeight bucks|0
i know i know  how could i give one of the hottest hip hop albums of all time two stars right  well ive got a better question for you  how could bad boy piss all over biggies legacy and mutilate this classicbefore they spend their money on this fakeness the fans have the right to knowespecially the young folks who werent even around back in the daythat the album you see before youthis so called remasteris not what biggie fans rocked out to in 94  this is not the album that was bangin in the clubs in our cars or at our house parties  take it from someone who was there this socalled remaster is not just an enhancement of sound quality as the name might imply its a totally different albumdont get it twisted the original version the one with the white cover wasnt some rough mix that was stolen from easy mo bees basement and released on the streets as a bootleg or whateverit was the official studio release  the one you bought at sam goody coconuts or until 2006 right here on amazon  and now its gone forever in favor of this inferior messand why  money mostly  and a touch of political correctness1 bad boys legal department apparently fd up and some of the samples used on the original werent cleared properly so rather than tap into their billions and just pay whatever licensing fees were necessary for the rerelease diddy and company decided to just change the originals  so now tracks like machine gun funk and ready to die sound totally different  they are not at all what we heard when we first bumped this album back in 942 some of biggies original lyrics were apparently too raw for the sensibilities of the new millenium so they were edited out or backmastered  most notably on juicy where he spits time to get paidblow up like the world trade referencing the 1993 attack on the towers  on the remaster the words world trade are edited out presumably because someone might think he was making a reference to 911 seven years before it actually happened  while i understand that 911 was a catastrophic and horrible event and would certainly agree that a rapper using it as a euphemism for accruing wealth would be unbelievably crass i also dont think that record companies should go back and selectively edit albums that came out seven years before the tragedy even happened because someone might think that biggie was nostradamus and predicted the whole thing in his crystal ball thus compromising his original vision and lyricismnow that this remaster has come out the only way to get the original is to run it down in some used record store  think about what this means  kids who grew up hearing that biggie was the best and wanting to hear the album that their elders say prove it will rush to purchase or download this remaster because its the only thing available not realizing that they are not hearing what those of us who copped the original heard back in 94  theyre not hearing biggie as we heard him  theyre not hearing his magnum opus  theyre hearing a compromised mutilated version of that album again think about what this says about bad boys respect for their greatest artist the man whose talent they pretty much rode to wealth and glory would anyone dare to dream of doing this to the beatles sgt peppers bob marleys catch a fire or marvin gayes whats going on  no  then what does this say about bad boys respect for biggie and hip hop as an artform in generalbecause its biggie i cant bring myself to give even this mangled version of his vision one star but because this musical mutilation is the auditory equivalent of putting boxer shorts on donatellos david or a bra on the venus de milo i also cant bring myself to give it more than twoto the young hip hop headz out there consider yourselves warned  if you want to hear biggie as 90s headz heard him when this classic disc first dropped back in the day this isnt the version youre looking for  pressure bad boy to rerelease the classic version full and intact  peace|0
this review is not about the actual film i love the beatles and help is one of my favorite movies its a fabulous and timeless film that entertains me every time i see ithowever this review is for the sellerthis was one of the most troublesome returns ive had to do  the dvd box booklet and plastic disc holder were all damaged  it looks as if during the packaging in the factory a piece was sliced away from all of the aforementioned parts  the dvd itself was fine  but that is not the point since there is a lovely looking booklet that comes with the dvd  however due to the missing pieces that were sliced away i was unable to fully enjoy the text and photos includedthe product costs too much for that kind of damage  and when i tried to get a replacement copy of course there was only an option for return and refund  and then there was no way for me to contact the seller and let them know about the damaged product  too bad that all of this trouble popped up when all i wanted was to enjoy one of my favorite bands in a fun moviethis was a christmas gift from my parents and it was a present i was very much looking forward toi will not be ordering from this seller again due to the trouble i have encountered  keep in mind the prospect of a troublesome return if you decide to order from this seller|0
i am usually in full agreement with my amazon reviewer friend and colleague stewart crowe but on this occasion we must part company i found this recording underwhelming in many waysdohnanyis way with the score is certainly different in that he brings a cool forensic manner to bear upon the score often imposing a kind of silvery glow over this incandescent score  but incandescence is exactly what goes out of the window as a result although orchestral details emerge cleanly in the rather dry acoustic there is no rush or thrill in his interpretation the vpo is never let off the leash and plays neatly without passion the orchestral preludes to jochanaans declamatory outbursts and salomes dance go for little compared with the sensuous allure of karajans account and dohnanyi never emulates soltis drivenone of the voices here is a match for the formidable competition on other earlier recordings although malfitanos lighter sound might theoretically be more appropriate to portraying a libidinous sixteenyearold the persistent beat by this stage of her career is obtrusive in her tone and quite reverses the potential gains suggesting exactly what it is  an overstretched aging lyric soprano virtually every phrase wobbles and her top notes squawk too often she sounds more like her mother should and i take little pleasure in her singingproblems continue with terfels jochanaan he sounds oddly inert and smallscale  indeed as if he could be singing scales beautifully its true but where is the prophet with one foot in the next world in this interpretation waechter van dam and milnes all convey so much more of the virility and passion of the voice from the cistern that denounces sinnersif the two main voices are inadequate then the quality of the supporting cast is rendered almost irrelevant but it just so happens that the narraboth is weak the herodias blowsy and ordinary and riegels herod very dry of voice perhaps the vocal quality of the latter two matters little from the point of view of dramatic verisimilitude but for home listening one doesnt necessarily want voices as unattractive as the characters they are portrayinggiven the superior quality of rival versions i see no reason for preferring this one and i shall return to the three superlative tried and tested recordings aboveincidentally if you actually want this recording there is little point in buying it in its latest bargain incarnation as the ddd sound wont have been improved given that it was recorded as recently as 1994 and you can get the older issue with a full libretto for a few dollars as opposed to undergoing the inconvenience and irritation of having to download it|0
this cd rocks the lyrics are flawless along with laceys amazing voice they have the perfect sound and overall a perfect score in my book flyleaf is an amesome band who i definitely recommend to any rock fan|1
ive had this cd since the day it was released ive listened to it everyday since and it never gets old the songs are solid the playing is probably their best on record its an amazing cd i could write a review of every song but its already been done if you like old rush the 3 piece guitar band with the big sound youll love this cd if you ever wondered how rush would sound if they improvised rather than rehearsed every note to metronome perfection youll love this cd|1
the first full length album after major lineup changes this record is weird in a really cool way  the music rocks and the lyrics are second to none  kinda like the soundtrack to a really bad science fiction movie you  know the ones where robots and mad scientists are involved  anyway i  love this album and you will too|1
this album is cliched mor 80s hard rock with some of the most ridiculously unconvincing dark lyricsand under the sabbath name that is really unforgivabletony martin was on a couple albums that were decent in their own right the eternal idol and cross purposes namelythis one though and forbidden really stink up the place|0
no question about it this album is better then their previous classic the dark side of the moon  this album is like a greatest hits album  this album features comfortably numb hey you another brick in the wall nobody home dont leave me now mother the trial run like hell etc  when i listened to the album the wall i thought this album was nothing compared to other pink floyd albums but after a few days it grew on me  i love the whole album and ive listened to the albumwhat a hundred times  i just started listening to pink floyd by the wayi rate this  out of |1
this album makes you give a negative rate no matter what it must be the worst record they have ever released strict only to venom fan collectors if you are new try black metal album|0
what michael w smith captures on this cdis angelic this by far has become my favorite christmas alblum of all time jesus is the reason for the season and yes this cdis very spiritualso if youve heard  jingle bell rockone time too manyand youre looking for music  that will inspire and refresh this ones for you michael is joined by the  american boys choir schoolthe nashville festival orchestra as well as his  longtime friend amy grant my favorite cut is all is wella solo  by nathan wadley of the boys choirone of the most beautiful songs ive  ever listened to this cd is a remarkable work of art|1
although the songs are the correct choice the musicals and singers are not very good overall a poor choice of artist|0
the cds are marvellous but the sending has been lamentable the double box has come totally ruined useless the cds have come well but bearing the cost of the sending in mind i am very discontented|0
i was less than impressed with snakes and arrows vapor trails and even test for echo counterparts was the last rush album i really got intountil now honestly this album took a few listens to get into some songs stood out instantly bu2b the wreckers and the anarchist were instantly likable then over a few listens songs like headlong flight the garden and caravan sunk in and clicked this is a complete album it really needs to be treated as a whole piece and not separate songs its like reading chapters of a book out of order or randomly the album really flows togetheri really hope rush has another album or two in them clockwork angels appears to be the band headed in a great direction|1
im very imbarrassed that a music fan from a pitiful world would use my name to speak ill about pink floyd how can a person live with themselves everyday saying that pink floyd is less than a 5 star bandi like nextto all different types of music chili peppers acdc pink floyd black sabbath statikx tiamat erase the grey led zeppelin icp nightwish pantera the ramones  fyi johnny ramone just died and a whole lot more i usually can find 1 good band in all different music  alot more than a music fan or you cant ban me can say for themselves pink floyd is and awesome balanced band the wall is a cd fit together in the perfect balance of slow and fast beats spreaded beautifully throughout this album its a must buy for openminded music lover|1
i bought this for my husband for christmas since he is a big rush fan and as usual it didnt disappoint|1
avoid this 1993 cd edition sound quality is very low it lacks trebles and the beginning of the maestoso iv is full of distortion a better edition of the same material is the2004 sacd that is playable even with a normal cd player and provides higher sound quality better stereoimage and less distortion|0
i love myles voice and every song on here kicks ass my personal fav is shots fire the last song on the album|1
i wasnt feeling this cover at all reallyafter biz markie anything else is flat to menow snoop was rolling after his first albumprojects with drdreetc but this song was just like the album doggfather flatpredictablesnoop has done beter songscoversthis isnt it|0
what a supreme disappointment this was  i have no interest in these songs whatsoever and thought i was purchasing a soundtrack containing the beautiful music from the movie  now i see that there is another soundtrack but am simply not sure i want to buy it now because i feel like ive been duped|0
this cd is a masterpiece full of emotion and great music some of the best songs aremother hey you dont leave me now and comfortably numb but those r just my personal favoritesbut this cd is just a work of art anybody would b happy 2 have this in there collection|1
i could have made a better cd copying it on my own computer several songs on the cd kept skipping all the way through while others wouldnt play at all|0
i am a big pink floyd fan and i saw the wall film many times before checking out the album  everything sounds fine except the glaring omission of what shall we do now  to me this was one of the coolest parts of the movie and when i first listened to the album i had to stop it when i realized this song wasnt on the release  as far as i am concerned this is a total ripoff  why would it not be on the album just to make room for all of roger waters sappy pianobased tracks  i wanted to hear one of the few songs on this piece that actually rocks and will be listening to my live version of the wall instead  if anyone has any explanation for this omission id love to hear it|1
this cd contains new material that is reminiscent of songs from not only the 2112 album but also grace under pressure im still amazed 30 years later how awesome rush is|1
this is an abosolute disgrace to beethovens music the music is far below the tempos that beethoven originally wrote the quality of the recording equipment is also quite terrible i was extremely displeased with these pieces i now have learned a valuable lesson never purchase inexpensive recordings they tend to be of poor quality|0
i love to listen to this album even when it isnt the christmas season  michael w smith is a gifted performer and arranger of the orchestral accompaniments to his own music|1
this is the worst excuse for an opera recording ive ever heard the singers are horribly out of tune the strings arent together and there is no english translation in the liner notes|0
but it dosent deserve it i must say i was quite dissapointed in horners so called excellent score for years i have looked at horner as one of my favorite composers but along with titanic this score  just isnt worth the price if you have enjoyed other soundtracks such as  willow or the rocketeer you wont like this score  but those who enjoy low quiet and somewhat erie music this may appeal to  you however i would not reccomend this soundtrack|0
the crusaders really came into their own in the 70s with their own blend of jazz funk and pop culminating with their smash hit street life in 79 however the 80s proved to be a different story for them and indeed for so many other oncegreat groups out with the old in with the new as they saythis is an album that mostly falls victim to the production techniques of the day really thin guitars and keys farty synth bass and that awful linn drum the horrorthree tracks actually feature real drums and are quite good they are zalale minimr cool and the gorgeous and haunting dream street which features a real string section heres a quick trackbytrack rundown1dead end midtempo dance forgettable melody sounds like halfcooked backing tracks for a marvin gaye tune from midnight love2gotta lotta shakadala  another dance tune mediocre female vocalist probably the worst tune on here3new moves yet another dance tune same tempo as the first two tunes no less same boring singer intro sounds like an upbeat theme to an 80s tv show and not in a good way4zalale mini  nice laid back funk flavor nice unison vocal line real drumming nice solo from joe first decent track5 night ladies  back into 80s dance hell same tempo as first three tracks same mediocre vocalist same linn drum junk could have been a decent smooth jazz tune with better production6 mr cool  sounds like a smooth jazz classic probably my favorite track memorable melody good composition great chords real drums a solid track7 dream street  sounds like its from an entirely different album just beautiful real grand piano real strings haunting tune wilton sounds great on this one strong trackso overall i can really only recommend about 15 minutes of the music on here the rest just does not invite repeated listening its a shame because its clear that they were trying to write commercially due to pressure from the label or otherwise if you are a big fan get it for dream street and mr cool|0
ive been a rush fan since 1980 when i was 12 and i was disappointed in some of their stuff from the late 80s through the 90s  this is not to say that those albums were bad just that that period isnt my favorite and i dont listen to those albums very frequently  i point this out so that this 5star review wont be dismissed as a fanboy review  and as always with a review of this type it is very subjective as there is no accounting for tastethe technical ability songwriting lyrics and production quality of this album are spectacular  i dont know any other way to put it  i got ahold of the mp3s about a week ago ive subsequently purchase the cd more on that in a bit and ive listened start to finish over 20 times  the music is energizing in much the same way that signals was in 1982 and i do not tire of the album  i cannot say the same for some of the 90s albums like prestoone of the things i like most about this band besides their music is their work ethic and the fact that in real life they are genuinely nice people  most rock musicians with this kind of success at this age seem to want to milk the past for all they can for minimal effort  rush on the other hand just completed a marathon monster tour then headed back into the studio and cranked out an album that clearly required a great deal of time and effort to create that is original but still clearly rushi initially had some 192kbps mp3s but i purchased the cd and it arrived yesterday 611  i have to say that comparing the cd to 192k mp3s there really is no comparison  ive ben listening to flac rips from the cd and it is a far better experience  there is a crispness in the music that the mp3 compression obscures  get the cd or get the 24bit flac files from hd tracks|1
maybe i just dont get it but i fail to see the attraction of this set as an ardent callas supporter i just cannot come to terms with this recording for various reasons callas voice was by 1964 only a shaddow of its former self there is a very unpleasant beat in her upper notes and in her lower register there is an intrusive wobble gedda described it in his autobiography  after having sung her praises  that by the time she recorded carmen she sang as if she had a potato in her mouth compare her singing to any of the sets produced in the 1950s and you will notice that by 1964 she had lost control of that instrument that she used to master better than any involvement yes there is involvement but what good is it when the voice is in deplorable condition as a result she mouthes many of her phrases when she should be singing them victoria de los angeles is also very much involved on the famous beecham set her voice is in impeccable condition her french diction is to my ear faultless and the standard of all the protagonists including gedda and the conducting far superior to what you find on the callas set pretres conducting is a middleoftheroad kinda affair and that road is according to arnold schonberg the only road that never leads to rome the kind of conducting that you find on many recordings nowadays maazels lombards ozawas but certainly not with the elan of thomas beechamok callas voice was always ugly but when she mastered it  and she surely did in the 50s  she was captivating moving breathtaking to a degree where you had to get involved as a listener her singing made you see the action on stage it was all there in the singing carmen she never sang on stage but with her ability there is no question she would have made an excellent job of it when she was in her prime in 1964 there was very little left i cannot think of any other recording of any other work where a singer the voice being in such bad condition was still allowed|0
what else can i say that hasent already been said  but its back on the top 100 again thanks to this remaster  profoundly changed my musical tastes in 8th grade when it came out  sad to see that the musical industry will not promote bands like shadow gallery who have followed in their footsteps  you have all these people in their 30s and 40s with disposable income a demograph less likly to copy music and a grammy winning concept album in green day yet the best music of this decade is coming out of europe never to see the light of day on american radio|1
the socalled original cast recording of call me madam is not satisfying because due to contract problems rca victor was forced to substitute dinah shore for ethel merman and it is not an ideal replacement  deccas studio album with ethel merman singing 12 songs from the score lacks theatricalityfortunately the movie version retained merman surrounded her with a great set of performers donald oconnor george sanders and retained most of the score from the stage show  even the changes are mostly improvements the lugubrious once upon a time today is replaced by the lively what chance have i with love giving oconnor his requesite eccentric dance routine we lose washington square dance heard in the film as an instrumental background to a washington party scene and the showstopping they lke ike eisenhowers election in the fall of 1951 made the song unusable and besides it had nothing to do with the plot but the film gains from the redistribution of songs it takes some of the emphasis off ethel merman though she remains ver much the star her second act opener something to dance about is shifted to oconnor and vera ellen and sets up an entertaining dance sequence  george sanders is perfectly cast as the foriegn minister merman falls for and here has a chance to display his warm baritonethe orignal release of this album was on a 10inch lp the standard format for most movie soundtracks in the early 1950s and decca ensured that all of the songs were included  not all of the dance music would fit but a good amount of it is heard nonetheless  best of all this little album has the theatricality missing from the two stage cast albums and consequently was the preferred version of the score the problem was that the 10inch format went out of vogue by the mid 1950s and this version of call me madam vanished from the catalogues  it was briefly reissued on one side of a 12inch lp in 1981 but aside from two tracks on rhinos cd irving berln in hollywood it has not been available on cd until now part of the problem is that decca no longer owns the rights to these tracks since they are owned by 20th century fox  at one time a few years back there were rumous of a new complete and expanded soundtrack album to be released on cd but as of this writing that has not happened it may yet  the movie was finally released on dvd in 2004this cd comes from hallmark in england and appears to have been issued through the legal loophole that places recordings in england that are more than 50 years old  in the public domain the cd was not remastered from the original tapes but appears to have been taken from a poor tape of the original lp there are numerous dropouts and phase problems the sound refuses to stay centred in pure mono there is also a loss of the crisp highs and the detailed bottom end that characterized deccas original album  the cd is also short containing just the 28 minutes of music on the original album with no extras  the short playing time i could accept but the sound quality is so poor that this cd isnt even a mixed blessing  best to wait until rhino or some other label brings out a new and expanded madam|0
those reviews below me are written from kids that have no idea what music is if you dont like old music why dont you stop things people did in the past like breathing and eating well anyway this album is great and still is the second best selling ever the music has an excellent sound the variation of the different types song styles waters leads mostly every song and he does justice to them do yourself a favor and pick this up|1
i hate to be one of those people that gripes endlessly when a horror sequel changes things up and doesnt stick to the formularules that the original setup but this is ridiculous following up two mindblowing and unique horror movies hellraiser iii hell on earth is limp on all accounts in this installment the filmmakers opted to turn pinhead into the star of the movie these movies were never supposed to focus on pinhead rather they revolved around ordinary people and how their decisions and lifestyles affect and destroy the lives of themselves and those around them the story of frank and julia was compelling because their severe selfishness and evil basically unleashed hell on half a dozen innocent people but i digress here pinhead is pushed into the spotlight and comes across as a freddy krueger clone obviously with the success of films like a nightmare on elm street and friday the 13th and their notorious villains the people behind this flick had the mindset that they could do the same for pinhead well folks i have to say it just did not work for starters pinhead isnt funny and shouldnt be funny and dont even get me started on the mindless droning speeches he would give throughout the film very frustrating and obnoxious to watch and should i even bring up the cd spitting cenobite the characters are way too cartoony and have no life in them i didnt feel convinced or sympathic towards anyone whenever a plotpoint would be presented that was supposed to enhance certain characters it was never built upon correctly and was just presented very clumsily a major slide from the first two flicks which gave you colorful characters to love and hate as you wished another point that the movie fails on is it relies to heavily on gore and i dont mind gore im obsessed with horror movies but gore is useless if it isnt accompained by suspense here it just seems gratuitous and the effects themselves leave much to be desired towards the end i started to fall asleep and didnt care too much to see how the movie ended up the sign of a truly bad horror movie hellraiser iii hell on earth can be enjoyed on a somewhat superficial level as a fan of slasher movies i found this to be somewhat entertaining in bits but overall its an utter failure the dvd is pathetic special edition hardly there is not a single extra to be found on here no trailer no production notes nothing the only thing special about this edition is that it is hard to track down  my copy is a canadian import|0
roll the bones counterparts test for echo vapor trails sankes and arrows and now clockwork angels  at first i hated all of them and as usual the latest rush album has overwhelmed me eventually  been a fan since 1977  this latest rush recording is nothing short of spectacular  it will require several listens before even the most rabid rush fan gets it  this album is incredible  cant wait to see it live in oct in bridgeport ct  5 stars|1
the songs are the songs i wanted but not at the quality i wanted  i had to go back on the net and look for the mp3s for my dance troupe  its a shame|0
john mccutcheon is a great american treasure and one of the best folk artists around he also writes and performs some of the best original childrens music in the countrywintersongs is part of a four album series celebrating the four seasons of a year all of the songs on the album are original and evoke a playful spirit that is sure to bring out the child in everyone  children really seem to enjoy tommy dont lick that pipe new boots and soup the most but are delighted by each of the other songs as well my favorites on the album include fly groundhog day and footprints a great album to listen to when it gets cold outside or if you just want to think about the wonder of winter|1
i cant believe the amazon reviewer liked this so much  it is a waste of money  youll know it was a mistake within four songs maybe three  if you want good novelty christmas music this is not it  i sure wish id done more research than just take the word of the amazon reviewer|0
sorry i hate to say anything negative about wayne shorter but i just cant connect to this record it seems to have been influenced by miles tutu which i love or other sounds of the same era but comes out weak  poppy|0
my daughter loved raffi when she was a child i was so happy to find this music to share with her baby  some things never go out of style  these songs bring back a lot of wonderful memories|1
i really enjoyed the movie and looked forward to getting the soundtrack  none of the vocals were on the cd  the only tracks were of the  instrumental background music and several were repeated a couple of times  but under different names  what a waste of 1400|0
i cant review this cd properly because i never received it and neither amazon nor the seller will respond to my inquiries i have been cheatedbruce t scott|0
i normally woudnt give a beatles album less then 4 stars but this album is really a rip off i really cant see people giving this 5 stars unless  your a classical music fan theres only 6 beatles songs on this 2 of them  are from revolver and magical mystery tour that leaves you with 4 new  beatles songs and you know what the songs arent that bad hey bulldog is  the best out of the new songs georges songs its only a northern song and  its all too much are cool and very pschyedelic all together now is good  but lyrically stupid i love it side two is just boring elevator music i  cant reccommend this but i do reccomend the yellow submarine songtrack|0
post g nr fameappreciation is very ironic to me when i grew up g n r was a nice blend of hanoi rocks george thorogoodim serious and punk influences one of the many things that set them apart were their solos which werent overly indulgent like poison bon jovi or the other egotistical guitar heroes that dominated mainstream media now years later slash is hailed as a guitar hero and is splashed all over magazine covers guitar center ads and television his current status with all the signature gear is eerily similar to the aforementioned detested bandssig gear you can buy an old school jcm800 amp for a fraction of the cost or track down the rare jubilee heads the duncan jb pickups in that overhyped afd guitar can be had for 160 throw them in an lp standard and there ya go same thing schooled players know that appetite was recorded with a oneoff custom made lp copy stuff it gibson what makes this record bad current live performances feature 5 minute guitar solos very selfindulgent this group feels like some hired guns covering some g n r tracks sure slash can still play but these riffs seem very metal and selfindulgent i like that hes in a group without drama and tip my hat to his success but myles kennedy doesnt seem to compliment him well g n r was successful because as a unit they worked well apart the results are so varied duff has remained down to earth but a front man his vocals arent up to par same with this lp the music here and there has some highlights but seems so disjointed as wholehow many fans like this independently of guns does this record stand up on its own minus slashs previous band these are honest questions to askhave fun being post guns lap dogs|0
shipping time was awesome  product was exactly what it said it was  quality product as well and the price was very low  love this guy|1
everything that has been written so far is true  this was indeed biggies finest hour  what you should know is that aside from the bonus dvd and the inclusion of who shot ya and just playin dreams there is no additional material compared to the original  the sticker on the front says remixed and remastered but none of the key remixes that originated from ready to die are included  what a shame  over the years we have come to know and love the smooth remix of one more chance featuring faith on vocals as well as the bangin club remix aka one more chance hip hop mix  big poppa also received an excellent remix treatment when it was released as a single  these are the versions that we remember as classics  not the original versions  how hard would it have been to include these remixes as part of this package  theres plenty of space left on the bonus discfor the reason listed above the album retains its 5 star rating in my books but this particular remastered release gets a 2 star rating from me  if you have the original ready to die there is little reason to get this|0
i have always loved the hawkins family i had to rebuy this cd because i could not find it in my collection and needed to hear a certain song  beautiful wonderful harmonies and awesome lyrics which really minister to me|1
ive owned pink floyd the wall on cassette early vinyl cd and now this heavy vinyl reissue  it is my favorite rock album overall  i remember purchasing this record on cassette when it first came out  after listening to it all the way through for the first time in 1980 it was clear to me that it was and is an extraordinary classic arguably pfs greatest album  this is pfs most fully realized album with so much happening both musically and lyrically that it challenges you to listen and understand the powerful concept and all of the tragedy that feeds into it  i remember being 16 years old when it was first released and digging into the lyrics to understand their message  it was then and some 30 odd years later it still is an emotionally powerful album  the wall just doesnt succeed as a rock album it succeeds as a true work of art  it is like a shakespeare tragedy thats not designed to make us happy but to help us learn from lifes sufferings on both an historical level and on a personal level  dont we all build walls in our lives in some way  the message of the wall is to break down the walls that prevent us from being truly happy peopleyoure probably more interested in the reissue rather than my musings about the albums art  its a very nice 180 gram pressing that was remastered by james guthrie who was one of the original people who worked on the wall  the source tapes were used  the remaster is excellent and it sounds good right out of the jacket  i cleaned the visually perfect records with a vpi wetvac rcm and the sound was illuminated after the cleaning  i played the records with my classic sony strv5 85 wattschannel clean power receiver with a technics turntable equipped with a grado cartridge through a pair of nht classic three book shelf speakers on stands  i used the flat response settings  the sound is rich and full yet it sounds balanced  i did encounter some noise on side 3 in some spots but im thinking further rcm cleanings will reduce or eliminate the noisethe packaging is very nice  the jacket has much of the original artwork and some new artwork on the back  it comes with a big 32x38 poster that has all of the albums lyrics with the white brick wall in the background  you also receive a card with a code to complete a free mp3 download of the entire album  you get pink poly inner sleeves as well as the original paper sleeves heavier than the original sleeves with the lyrics on them that came with the original vinyl releaseoverall this is an excellent reissue  some have complained about the price  great music will command a higher price and were talking about one of the greatest rock albums of all time  whether or not whats in this package is worth it to you will depend on your own personal standards  if this album means as much to you as it does to me you will have to have it and remember the ones who really love you walk up and down outside the wall|1
the wall was their second best album after the dark side of the moon and was so good that it sold over 22 million copies all over the world on the strengths of songs like comfortably numbrun like hell and another brick in the walla must buy for all rock fans|1
in my opinion this is the finest christmas album ever produced and by far the high point of michael w smiths impressive career  there are not enough superlatives to describe it  the majesty of it is breathtaking  at points it simply sweeps you away  it is at once fully modern and almost classical  it is utterly uniqueadditionally fans of smith will note that this was the capstone of the sound he portrayed in the 1980s  he shifted gears pretty dramatically after thisthis album really is timeless powerful worshipful and must not be missed  despite its uniqueness theres nothing trendy to it and it will last through the ages|1
regarding the messa da requiem only with the volume adjusted to an enjoyable level to listen to the orchestra the vocal soloists are almost inaudible with the volume turned up to a level adequate to hear the vocal  soloists after the orchestra starts to play again the volume is much to  loud would appreciate recommendations for a recording of verdis requiem  which does not have this problem or if you have this recording and it  sounds good to you please let me know|0
i like rain and thunder sounds  however i would like to ask  where did they record this socalled storm  in my native central america storms sound terribly beautiful  powerful thunder and noisy rain and all the stuff  not like this poor cd|0
the sound quality on this cd is excellent unfortunately just as the tchaikovsky begins there is a false start or skip i cant quite figure out what it is i would like to exchange it for another copy if possible please advise thank you|0
i thought this cd was terrible back when it came out and i still do today because it had both muziq and aphex twin as musical collaborators i purchased it without hearing a note simply based on their stellar resumes the songs are so beneath what either were doing solo at the time hardly innovative and quite embarrassing i know both of the artists involved often inject humorous elements into their own work but humor in the tracks here dont work because the music is so mundane not a total loss at least the album cover and packaging was well done and more entertaining than the music contained within|0
for people whose first introduction to pink floyd was the wall this is the best and most original pink floyd album  but it really isnt  it is about 25 too long including songs that dont really add to the story and arent that good musically  the ideas here have been expressed in earlier pink floyd work such as dark side of the moon and espcially wish you were herei consider this pink floyds answer to genesiss lamp lies down on broadway  they are nearly identical albums in theme format and structure  they both have a cathartic grand finale and a hopeful epilog even the album covers are similar  only the genesis album came out several years earliersince the wall is basically a rock opera it works much better as a live show  the recently released live version is there anybody out there is an improvement over the studio version  it brings out the energy and emotion of the story  my criticisms of the wall are minor and the live version pushes the work into five star material|1
this is my absolute favorite amy weintraub cd and i love the others if you practice yoga or you teach yoga buy this cd and help yourself and your clientsi am a psychotherapist and amy weintraubs work is specialnamaste|1
the main fault of the sampler isnt its playlist which is perfect for introducing newcomers to the classical genre rather this cd is a failure specifically due to inadequate musician skills the soloists in particular sound fairly dreadful on the full orchestral selections the wrong instruments get emphasized and theres a total lack of expression and nuance throughout to listen to these one would think that all classical music is lifelessly dull and trite and of course it isntmadacy blows it again not recommended 1 stars|0
these old recordings did not sound as bad on my 78 sets and are heard better on lys 271273 where they are transferred in genuine mono  on this pearl transfer by lennick the bass is grotesquely boomy there are poor highs and gobs of fake stereophonic echo making the sound rumbly indistinct and ugly  the performances are very fine better in some cases than the stereo versions mostly conducted by stravinsky with a lot of help from robert craft  however few collectors who are conscious of good technique in transferring old records would approve of this edition|0
not every rush album has been worthy of a five star rating but this one sure is  their best work since counterparts|1
one two three fourthese four historical lines are found at the very beggining of the very first song of the fab fours very first us album and odly enough they are located on one of the only great songs on the album basically weve got alot of covers which is forgivable when youve got john screaming his lungs out on a glorious twist and shout  youve got two of the best loved early beatles songs please please me and love me do which hold up nicely youve got a couple fairly good but forgettable lennon mccartney songs and thats about it its fairly good on its own right but remember the beatles had not yet changed pop culture and had not yet become well fab so the vocals are off theres one to many covers and the jlpm songs besides the two i mentioned are fairly forgettable still its alot better then alot of the crap being released today and it is an essiental part of any beatle collection just dont expect an abbey road or sgt peppers here|0
even though im an agnostic flyleaf has become one of my favorite bands they rock hardcore like nobodys business and while they fully express their belief in god they dont try to shove it down your throat i bet even athiests would enjoy these guys|1
informatively i have masons dvds which i quite enjoyhowever this cd labelled brand new contains many  repeats andsituations in fact at times i was ahead of jackie mason mouthing word for word the joke and situation he was leading up to memason spoke as if he was rushing to meet a deadline to the extent that much of the cd sounded like gibberish  for most of this cd i sat stone faced and suspected that perhaps the applause and clapping of hands were cannedmason in my opinion went overboard in his use of obscenitiesloudly and in his asidesseemingly contrived for shock valueas for me i think that this mislabelled brand new cd was aflop and i would not care to have it in my collection for fearof the impression i would leave after my demiseso another item destined for my shredderfinally i would recommend the mason dvds which i would have preferred with a slower delivery and less obscenities that addlittle to his performancerobert lyonsreno nevada|0
the wall is the the best pink floyd alblum no one of the best alblums ever made kids do you have the alblum if you do then you should lision to goodbye blue sky better yet lision to another brick in the wall overall  there are 2 weak tracks but the strength of the good ones outwegh the bad ones thoes being the last songs on each cd|1
after listening to this album you might as well call 1800terminix to report beetle infestations because there are plenty of creepy crawlers|0
how the hell does someone who made appetite for destruction and use your illusions suck slashwho is known for super creativity keeps on making these bland lame albums have you heard velvet revolver libertad this album is like that one|0
im glad to see todays generation getting into the walli was a teenager in 1980 when this album came out it blew me away after  listening to wish you were here animals dark side of the moon echoes and their earlier music i was amazed that the floyd could top themselves againthe only thing that disappointed me was the story at first blush i thought the story of epic alienation was about an ordinary guy i thought it shouldnt apply to a rock star since when has a rock star ever elicited sympathy anyway how much of the population has ever been lonely at the top most of us scurry at the bottom enduring the kind of alienation that comes from being nobodies its this kind of pain i can relate to not the pain of isolation that comes from being more successful and famous than anyone elseanyway the music is constantly gripping even if it reeks of selfpity at times the movie is psychedelic and wonderfully animated this album is an undeniable classic even if it is ocassionally overwrought ive listened to it hundreds of times and im sure ill listen to it hundreds of times moreenjoy|1
take ths8 on your ipod with speakers when y0u go to play on the beach  wowshows that some old 60s music is best|0
lliving in florida this album takes me straight back home with the beautifull music of blinky i would definately recommend it to everyone who yearns for carribean music|1
i find it hilarious that most people worship this as some kind of cult death metal release but its just some really watereddowned commercializedhappyclean death metal the vocals are boring   repitive the guitar playing isnt very aggressive the drumming average  the whole egyptian thing is sotry hard its not even funny the attention  their getting is ridiculios  im sure nile have fantasies about being  rockstars cmon people check no next to my review that  would make me feel quite wonderful i recommend this album to humanitarian  metalheads and trend lovers everywhere|0
this is the best material slash has put out since the gnr days i listen to this cd all the time here lately i recommend it to rock lovers|1
mc cutcheon has a way to convey through song what it is like to grow up and treasure things that we all have experienced but have forgotten about with age  his songs are the auditory equivelant of a norman rockwell  painting invoking nostalgia through stories any american who was at one  point a child can relate to  a high point is footprints which  metephorically compares walking in someones footsteps to observing and  patterning your life after them  if anyone has seen him live they know  his wit and stage prescence  he captures some of that in this album|1
after surprising the music industry and fans with their unexpectedly successful commercial selftitled debut 2009 chickenfoot is back with their second album iii while the name of the band and the albums title may be a bit silly for obvious reasons iii will surely be very well received by oldschool rock fans and longsuffering van halen fans in particularunlike the debut when i listened to iii i didnt think supergroup while i enjoyed the bands debut the new album just seems to have a better flow and now the band sound fully cemented much like with velvet revolver and audioslaves later albumshagar now 63 years young is still a powerful vocalist maybe his voice isnt quite as smooth as it once was but he is still a great singer and is certainly an elder statesmen of rock joe satrianis playing on this album is obviously topnotch and will delight any fan of guitar rock yet he never tries to hamitup or make it sound as though his playing were the centerpiece chad smith and michael anthony provide an exciting rhythm section and as always its great to hear mikes background vocals dont know how vh will pull off making an album without those harmoniesiii gets off to a good start with the melodic last temptation which sounds like hard rocking van hagar meets badmoterfinger era soundgarden alright alright has a great singalong chorus and wouldnt be a bad choice for the bands next single different devil is a bythenumbers balled but its pretty and effective up next has a bit of a zeppelin flavor and some particularly catchy guitar work lighten up was a grower for me at first i thought it was sort of filler but i liked it better with further listens the song may be slow to buildup but it has a great payoff come closer a bluesy balled shows a surprisingly honest sensitive side to the red rocker and reminded me of young girl blues a donovan cover from his 1976 debut nine on a ten scale the almost spokenword three and a half letters offers some social commentary on the plight of downandout honest middle americans who cant seem to catch a break while sammy might be quite wealthy he has always had an honest everyman quality and the song comes off effective and sincere big foot the albums first single took a few listens for me to really enjoy now its one of my favorite songs on the album its nothing ground breaking just a meatandpotatoes infectious slinky hardrocker that samvh fans will dig dubai blues is another good midtempo rocker which moves the album along the album closes with the semiacoustic bluesy rocker something going wrong its a very good song although kind of a downbeat way to end the album the bonus song no change is a good rocker but its message about how they lied about all sorts of things made little sense to me still its a cool songiii may not be a masterpiece but it is a very very good album iii isnt just predictable comfort food for aging rock fans either it gives you what you might expect at places but also challenges the listener if you like van halen and classic rock in general and are dismayed by the lack of quality music out today iii will give you a fix of what you need|1
gloria is an absolute masterpiece  i enjoyed all the songs but gloria is my favorite  michael has done a wonderful arrangement on the old classic christmas song  i saw mws in concert dec 3 at mci center in washington dc   this song was performed magnificently  it gave me chills  we need  to hear more|1
this is a great album the songs are fresh and modern the concert was awesome go see them live if you can|1
this was genesis first album recorded when they were teenagers at the charterhouse school the british equivalent of a prep school they were more of a folk ensemble than rock group at that point hardly able to do more with their guitars than strum peter gabriel tony banks and mike rutherford were already on board with anthony phillips on guitar and john silver on drums they sent demo tapes to producer jonathan king hoping to parlay a songwriting career and found that king preferred to have the boys record their own songs after which he slapped a bunch of orchestration on it hoping for a success in the style of the moody blues days of future passed instead the album only sold 600 copies though it has been rereleased in a hundred different versions over the years and has probably sold in the hundreds of thousands by now in addition to the original 13 songs this version includes a couple of early singles with chris stewart on drums and several demos many previously released on the genesis archive 196775 boxed set and interviewsseveral songs are pleasant in a wildly naive way but other than in the wilderness with its musicall i hear is musicguaranteed to please chorus and one day nothing here is good enough to deserve frequent listening the songs are short and poppy unlike anything else they would do during the gabriel era much of it is vaguely reminiscent of what the moodys were doing at the time the lyrics are like the poetry you wrote when you were 16 and cant stand to look at now on the single silent sun they purposely tried to sound like the bee gees because they knew king liked the bee gees this is a two and a halfstar album im rounding down1poor 2mediocre 3pretty good 4very good 5phenomenal|0
this recording could have been one of the best on the market with its superstar cast and famous conductor i bought this recording with high expectationsthey were severely disappointedpavarotti at one time was the one the best alfredos around but in this 1992 recording his voice sounds strained and weak and is simply unable to meet the rigors of the part studer is at best uninspired as violetta at worst her portrayal of the vibrant funloving playgirl is boring and lifeless at some points i get the impression she would rather be singing a different part and the orchestra sounds about half as big as it ought to be an orchestra of mice rather than men and of course womenwhat saves this recording from a lower score is an intense pons as the elder germont he di provenza is actually quite good and he sounds appropriately sad and torn during the opera as he should his is the only worthwhile performance in the entire recording excepting perhaps the gypsies at the beginning of act 2 scene 2 many of the other minor characters are admirably filled but the lack of strong leads ruins the entire performancein short this recording is a major disappointment and at  a major waste of your money if you really want a great recording of this opera buy instead giulinis 1955 la scala production with callas and distephano this is probably the hands down definitive recording of the opera too bad the sound is less than stellar for a more modern version listen to kliebers 1990 recording with cotrubas and domingo both offer a much better alternative than this train wreck of a recording|0
slash returns for his new solo album with myles kennedy from alter bridge on vocals and it is a great rock album that is sure to please fans waiting for a worthy sequel to appetite for destruction the production on this album is cool with the guitars right up front and myles kennedys vocals wailing on top slash is in fine form with some great riffs and some equally killer solos slash lets his influences such as led zeppelin and aerosmith permeate his song and riff ideas but he puts his own modern spin on it all highlights include the rocking album opener apocalyptic love the awesome groove of standing in the sun the massive chorus hook of no more heroes and the classical vibe of the guitar hook in anastasia the deluxe edition has the two bonus tracks carolina and crazy life that are definitely worth having and there is also an interesting behind the scenes look at the making of the album despite containing a couple of filler tracks apocalyptic love is highly recommended to fans of slash and will rank as one of the best pure rock albums of the year|1
i love his guitar skills and his music writing is just as good love this album its great to rock out to |1
clockwork angels holds some of the finest songwriting ive heard from rush in a long time  i dont know if working on the material while touring allowed them to spend extra time refining it but it sounds like theyve really made an effort to break outside their comfort zone  this is pretty progressive stuff for a rush album and for this 20year rush fan clockwork angels is an instant favorite|1
i would reccommend this cd to any hardcore rush fanafter all these years these three musicians can still deliver such creativity this group is like fine winethey keep getting better with age|1
brian regan is freakin hilarious  i am completely surprised that seemingly all other comedians feel the need to throw in as many swear words as possible while someone like brian regan can keep it completely clean  i dont remember hearing even one ounce of profanity on this cd  i seriously could listen to him over and over and its even better when you start to know some or all of the lines in his materialyou find yourself using these lines to relate to occassions in your own life  i have friends that love regan as well and we get humor from this cd even if we havent listened to it for a long time  i highly recommend this cd and also suggest checking out his new dvd i walked on the moon  seeing the facial expressions that go with his material just adds to everything  order this nowyou wont regret it|1
i cannot believe that this album is even on par with any of the great rolling stones albums  i mean the song maxwells silver hammer could have been written by a child  the beatles survive on silly little  love songs not good bluesbased rock and roll  they were not a  true band because they rarely played live  it is sad that  albums like abbey road are considered great  the beatles were  simply products of a studio  listen to lennon play with yoko at madison  square garden they sound like a band i knew in high school nobody  goes to sweden  listen to the stones  the song indian  girl is better then a day in the life  i am glad the  stones are not sell outs like the beatles  this album stinks|0
the only reason to purchase this disc is for its collection of hard to find sondheim songs the piano accompaniment is uninspired and the two voices border on annoying  such gems as so many people and  all creaturesbang earn the two stars|0
this is one great comedy cd i was able to relate to a few things which made it all the more funnier brian regan is definitely one of the better comics out there today and has been for years if there is 1 downside to this cd its that you cant see the visuals that he expertly provides on film but dont think you wont get your moneys worth|1
i really enjoyed james horners work on titanic it was emotional romantic intimate and so on but now i really dislike his attitude to his work almost every new work is so boring and clone like even themes are reappearing for example aliens theme appears in patriot games clear and present danger a beautiful mind and others didnt he realize his is copying himself or he is doing it with a reasonwhat about mask of zorro the first tracks first seconds with flamenco spirit gave me an idea i will get something new from this score but what a shame  ive been wrong some new ingredients but the recipe is the same even some motifs from aliens and titanic appears in some places the way of performance is better and not so usual as always but on the whole theres nothing musically new except the main theme sung in i want to spend my lifetime loving you which has strange lyric and very sticky melody with purpose to stick in your head for at least staying here for an houri have also ordered the john williams minority report i really hope it will be much more moving and emotional than this one|0
what a shock  the music is great but the cd is a japanese import and is in mono  there is no separation and it is flat  do not repeat do not buy this cd  amazon has another capitol label cd that i believe is stereo|0
the beatles material here is generally good particularlly hey bulldog its all too much and only a northern song but the instrumentals are pretty bad and i dont wanna see the movie overall not all that good|0
if you are looking for recordings about primitive percussion rythms then i recommend you to acquire this cd worth to listen|1
a lively collection that will take you back to the day of rideing around in the car with the boys|1
could have been better sampling in rap music is one thing but sampling samples is a little bit too much there are a few outtakes from the doggfather sessions on youtube that should have came out|0
these cds are fun and nurturing for my granddaughter we play them in the car when were out running errands theyre great|1
its not what i expected and the sound quality was below average i wont be recommending this to my friends|0
this is deep a classic one of my favorite albums and one you can listen from start to finish with no need to reach for the remote control except perhaps for turning the volume upyou have to experience it to understand it|1
i tend to ignore the concept and listen to the music the best of which was cowritten between waters and gilmorewhy did rw think he was the only light in the band|1
im pretty well known for throwing the best parties in gretna as youve prbably surmised from my previous reviews but the great ones always look to take it up another notch even at the top of their game i was always the first to know about new bands when they came out to gretna because they were on my famous fiesta mixes fiesta is the mexican word for party so i just subbed it in i was cranking out milli vanilli before the kids in elkhorn knew what it was the annual rick mahler birthday bash was coming up in a week and i knew i had to go over the top on the music because rick mahler was everyones favorite mid80s braves pitcher well over the top i went communist government style the party kicked off at 9pm with a 31 girl to guy ratio because thats how i roll i went with some hasselhoff remix stuff i got from a german kid named frumph to start the party off then came the curveball i tossed on some music from the peoples republic and it was as if everyone at the party had been injected with a crazy pill with the rocker commune members are sunflowers to lead things off how could one go wrong could it get better yes it most certainly could because track 2 is the synth punk anthem songs in praise of the peoples liberation army wow i was faced with a quandry at this point a smoking chick wanted me to take her to the palace but i wanted to see what kind of frenzy this cd whipped the party into lets just say after people love chairman mao and boys singing class with teacher i called the cops myself because i was scared of where this party was going it was like crunkfest but with a bunch of white people listening to chinese music i only bust this one out now when its a large outdoor gathering please be careful|1
the works by louis spohr featured on this recording are not standard works for clarinet which is very refreshing one can only hear the mozart concerto so many times before wondering if anyone else composed anything of note these works are quite interesting and fun to hear as well as to play however the performance is mediocre at best when listening to the recording one begins to wonder where one measure ends and the next begins even with a score it is difficult to find any semblance of a steady beat the expressive quality of the playing is also somewhat lacking partially because the technical aspects including tempo are quite weak while this recording offers the opportunity to become aquainted with different material for the clarinet it does not provide a good representation of the true musical quality of the pieces|0
people look up stuff before you fking talk the wall is not about some random self obsessed rock star its about pink anderson a fking blues musician that was one of pink floyds influences hence the name pink floyd can you guess what floyd was for you guessed it another blues musicianhow can you say the musicianship is terrible if i dont recall david gilmour is one of the greatest guitarists to ever live and a damn good songwriter too nick mason was a great drummer with lots of rhythm roger waters dont even get me started on him wake up you ignorant pieces of st cause you dont even know what youre talking about yet you try and sound as intelligent as possible so you dont lose your credibility but you come off as unintelligent as possible based on your inaccurate information and ignorant opinionsand stop with the multiple posts andor writing multiple reveiws under different names it makes you look stupid youre not fooling anybody with your overrepeated nonsense and it proves you have no life and nothing else better to do than to try and put down and bring down the rating for one of the greatest rock albums of all time even with all those negative reviews the average is still 4 and a half stars proving you wasted your time buhbye you cant claim to be a rock n roll fan and yet listen to the stuff listed on your profiles it just doesnt make sense that particular comment is intended for about half of you losers who chose to actually use your nameonce again stop wasting your time otherwise a five star album this was just kind of a spurofthemoment kind of thing|1
although joyce fenderella irby has a great distinctive voice she was much better served as the lead vocal for klymaxx than opting for her solo this is her first solo release and i think i would have prefered that she stuck with klymaxx this album has exactly one song that i like ill be there and its a duet ill be there is not a song that people remember by title so much but almost everyone will eventually recall hearing it after listening to the song if you dont mind the typical synthetic and discoesque sounds of the 80s then you may enjoy some of the other tracks on this album but for me i think ill stick with klymaxx if youre not familiar with klymaxx then perhaps youll just skip through this one altogether|0
i love the movie and have always thought that the music in it is very good too however i was disappointed with the soundtrack cd  it has like five different versions of the theme song in the moonlight which gets rather old after you listen to the first two or three|0
we love this cd  our kids love this cd  they e parts of it all the time in just normal family time which cracks everyone up  its clean  its funny  its worth the   the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because there are a few parts that i didnt think were very funny but 90 of it was great|1
why not buy the red album becuase it contains the early beatles which is much like bubble gum music becuase it has bad compilations of songs becuase it is just plain bad they forgot a lot of  classics including till there was you ive just seen a  face if i fell think for yourself  good day sunshine tomorrow never knows and no  biography or discography buy the albums and live the beatles|0
please for the children do not watch this film i cant believe i would put myself through this film i honestly believe this is the worst film made horror history why so bad|0
forro with cheesy production but decent singing  brazil classics forro on luaka bop is a much better place to start  i recommend cheking out videos by jackson do pandeiro morena bela os 3 do nordeste e proibido cochilar and luiz gonzaga o fole roncou to hear the best from this genre|0
denise has an extremely soothing voice  the background music and the meditation brings great comfort and direction i highly recommend this for those seeking mediation|1
even though these recordings were made in the 70s i still believe that pink floyd was instrumental in shaping the future of rockthey were far ahead of their time and with the exception of u2 they are one of the most copied and popular rock bandspieces such as another brick in the wall part 1 2 and 3 hey you is anybody out there and bring the boys back home are all rock classics|1
im sorry but this womans music just simply grates on my nervesher monotone  horrid  and tiny voice range is hurtful to the ears she actually had the arrogance to  criticize tori amos for being screeching and narciissistic when her own music couldnt begin to hold a candle to tori amosplease save your money and your pets earsthey will run  hide under the bed   go buy  gypsy or wendy rule and hear some soothing authentic witch music  not this harsh harpie pretender  yuccchhh   worst attempt at  pagan music yet   dont waste your money please|0
it seems odd that i would rate an album that i love so much so low  song of norway a relatively obscure musical film from 1970 starring florence henderson has never had a first rate dvd nor its soundtrack a cd release although the film has been on vhs a couple times  those wanting to experience the soundtrack had to look for the lp  the film and its soundtrack are favorites of mine so you can imagine my excitement when i saw the soundtrack was finally davailable for download here on amazon  so i downloaded itfail  not only does it not appear to be mastered from original sources it sounds almost exactly like my lp that i transferred to cd 3 12 years ago  just the minute clicks and pops are in different places and i can tell by the fidelity that this most certainly comes from an lpthis mp3 download is not bad  not at all  the fidelity is good and the music is clear  those who dont have access to the lp would do just fine by purchasing this download  it is satisfying overall but for a musical soundtrack from as recently as 1970 i would expect reissue producers to revert to the original tapes not a 40 year old lp  but then again this release does not come from either a major label nor the original label or successor to it of the lp release so who knows  if you already have the lp or your own cd transfer from it dont waste your money on this|0
what is there that i could possibly write that hasnt been written before about perhaps one of the greatest concept albums ever genesis the lamb lies down on broadway being the otheryes genesis actually existed before phil collins took over vocals when the genius behind the band peter gabriel departedbut i digress the only bon mot i could add is the fact that after all these years the wall still succeeds in captivating listeners i introduced my 6 year old daughter to the cd first then the movieshe is now a huge fan of not only the wall but earlier floyd stuff as well|1
raffi is a classic  my three children have been captivated by his natural ability to rhyme words and teach through music|1
i purchased this used on this site and it was from the page that said digitally remastered version  well my bad for buying it used because what i got was the older muddier sounding version|1
im a fan who likes arkology and the superape ones heart of the congos skimmed right over my ears with a lack of authenticity in melody or thumpback in the rhythmns however this is the man himself who could be tuning intildeto a wider audience and educating them tooim blinded by fela kuti so each to his own|0
this may be interesting for someone who is just learning archetypes however i found her presentation poor  too much repetition  felt that she was trying to fill up the time  and not enough input on solutions  i will stick with caroline myss|0
mysteries about life and death is the full name of this disc by the mexican death metal band called toxodeth this appears to be a fairly well respected album considering it goes for 30 and i have read a coupla positive reviews i had to check it out after all its early 90s death metal and oop out of print on the historic wild rags records wellll  its definitely not brutal it is kinda technical its kinda sloppy and its not really heavy i tell you one thing  the lead guitarist likes to show off his talent i would say 85 of this disc is guitar noodling twice the noodling as an early megadeth cd the vocals here are just embarrassing either the singer had asthma he is very weak or maybe he was trying to sound spooky during the recording whatever the case it is not guttural it is not screaming or yelling it is whispering and it is lame is he being suffocated in shrink wrap  really i dont see how anyone into quality death metal could like this due to its lack of power maybe this would be more of a fav for traditional metal fans so if youre looking for some old obscure death metal from back in time  theres nothing to see here so move alongwild rags records 1990 jay in texas|0
material was interesting  but i came to realize she basically lifted all her information from caroline myss without giving her credit so that left a bad taste in my mouth|0
i was not very happy with this purchase or the last purchase of the pianistthe pianist was defective and i had to return and pay shipping charges then reorder and pay charges againi could have bought a copy at best buy for less money and troublethen i ordered the beatles red album and it was defectivethe 2 cd set is labeled right but all the songs off of cd 2 is on cd 1  2i sent a complaint and find out the cd was sent from england now i am concerned about sending it back and paying shipping charges to englandso for now i still have the beatles cd that is defective and i dont know what to do  charles lund|0
to be fair the beatles never really had their hearts into the making of this album recorded mostly under the harsh glare of studio lighting in the cold confines of twickenham studio this live performance project was eventually shelved in favour of a return to the multitrack comfort of a proper recording studio from there work commenced on the bands true swansong abbey road as the band disintegrated let it be gathered dust and seemed destined to bootleg obscurity that is until john lennon saw fit to hire phil spector to tidy up the production and release it as a final beatles album in effect it is little more than an odds  sods collection whose release was hardly endorsed by the group as a whole mccartney had serious reservations nevertheless it occupies a space among the bands other albums on the record store shelves and therefore deserves to be held up to critical scrutiny unfortunately it doesnt hold up very well apart from spectors production which is an unmitigated disaster let it be suffers from a serious lack of first rate material two of the songs are credited to all four members dig it maggie mae and are little more than freeform jam sessions lennon contributes the wearysounding across the universe harrison sounds completely uninspired on his numbers i me mine for you blue and mccartney provides a disturbing glimpe into the future of his solo career with the syrupy titletrack replete with a leslietinged bythenumbers guitar break and female choir backing the albums one true moment of musical inspiration the long and winding road is nearly destroyed by a ghastly symphonic accompaniment courtesy of spector gone are the tight angular orchestal arrangements of george martin replaced by synthetic stringsections that practically drip out of the speakers abbey road provided such a perfect harmonious ending to the beatles great career its a shame that lennon and company saw fit to undermine that with a halfbaked souvenir album that can only be seen as a final cashin on the bands name|0
for anyone who is a fan of a true musical expieriencepink floyds the wall is for you argueabley the greatest floyd disc ever this 2 cd rock epic takes you through the dark alley that is lead  singer roger waters mind  his life story is told so well through  comfortabley numb and hey youthis disc is a must  own for any true floyd fan|1
have you ever said you too to a waitress after she tells you to enjoy your meal  i think we all have  brian comiserates with all of us and helps us to look at times like these through the humorous eyes they should be  my wife and i cant even say you too about normal things without cracking up and doing a parody of briani have played this cd for many different people and everyone loves it  from my 65yearold motherinlaw to my 6yearold son my extremely conservative mother and stepfather to my raunchy lunch crew that usually enjoys discussing the latest south park escapades more than anything else  no matter who you are you will enjoy this cd|1
while the early beatles and the final album abbey road are good i find the transition period revolver  sgt pepper pretty erratic  while people put eleanor rigby on a pedestal how can one say that it represents the completeness of the beatles since the backing music is purely orchestral  on the other hand taxman reaches back to the magic of the early days  then again tomorrow never knows is a mess and a hint of the selfindulgent chaos forthcoming on the white album 2stars|0
ok i realize beethoven wrote and performed these concertos on a fortepiano but the power and majesty of the music requires a good old grand fortepiano sounds way too tinkly for beethoven sort of like a barrelhouse piano in the old westthis disc comes from the complete set of beethoven concertos which also has some very interesting bonuses like a chamber verison of symphony number two however that box set is out of print|0
this is a great deal to have a 3 disc set  we parents and kids love raffi his style and his message  and there are so many songs so that we parents dont get too sick of it|1
for people whose first introduction to pink floyd was the wall this is the best and most original pink floyd album but it really isnt it is about 25 too long including songs that dont really add to the story and arent that good musically the ideas here have been expressed in earlier pink floyd work such as dark side of the moon and espcially wish you were herei consider this pink floyds answer to genesiss lamp lies down on broadway they are nearly identical albums in theme format and structure they both have a cathartic grand finale and a hopeful epilog even the album covers are similar only the genesis album came out several years earliersince the wall is basically a rock opera it works much better as a live show the recently released live version is there anybody out there is an improvement over the studio version it brings out the energy and emotion of the story my criticisms of the wall are minor and the live version pushes the work into five star material|1
what is coyly termed an interpretation with a sense of humor is on closer listening a rushed inconsistent treatment of the music in some passages one can sense that kempff is thinking about the music to come and blips through a powerful phrase with no attention to tempo or harmonic relationship tempo is constantly inconsistent minor technical errors abound from slips there is a total lack of inspiration some of the most amazing passages of beethovens music receive a lackluster inconsistent treatment so much meaning is lost i simply cant understand why people rave about this collection there is no joy in this set you are warned|0
bush is an amazing band and i love them  when i saw deconstructed in a used cd store i snatched it right up  i huried home to listen to it and nearly vomited  i have never bought anything that was such a waste of  money  if you like the sounds of bush than please do not even consider  purchasing this cd  it is an electronic piece of st  i dont know how  bush could allow their music to be so butchered  it didnt even deserve  the one star i gave it|0
clockwork angels is by far the best of all the concept albums that the band has created but is there a continuation to the story  the album begins with the tolling of a bright sounding bell which is then drowned out by a mysterious sound and then a very rush rock sound that continues snakes and arrows becomes present  according to the story that explains the tracks a young man is ready for journey and is thinking big  it should be noted that no other concept album is as extensive in how the story is fleshed out  and if you are concerned that the sound will not be impressive then settle your heart for the variety of sound that is the concert of clockwork angles is both delightful and surprisingthe sound that begins the album is certainly an important element that should not be dismissed  longtime fans of rush will recall the significance of the bell in losing it from signals  this is mentioned because here to we will be tracing the life of a character who reaches a stage of life that is much past his prime  in this adventure the character is not doomed to suffering though  instead the sound of most of the songs and lyrics are pointed towards passing down knowledge as evidenced in wreckers and the gardenfans will enjoy that much like the message from closer to the heart neil has pointed us all to improving the world around us and yet he has not shied away from the harsh truths that were raised in grace under pressure roll the bones test for echo and snakes and arrows in bu2b  and the character is wrought with angst in b2bu2 which makes the garden such a wonderful closing trackbefore commenting directly on the garden the opening tacks of clockwork angles in particular the track of the same name are some of the most passionate tracks and continues to capture the wideeyed nature that pervades the fountain of lamneth  in contrast to that track and its emphasis on the individual clockwork angels shifts focus to capture something more than just the life we live in trying to attain something monumentalthe garden is a capstone to the philosophical work of the band so far  the track opens with a harmonious arrangement of strings which is only a smooth transition from wish them well thanks to the calm chorus and balanced vocals and the message is also meaningful in the context of the album because it again is talking about a vile truth about life that limited time and the presence evil in the world are constants but does so in clam way that is worth lauding geddy lee the title artist and neil peart again the role of professorthe trios collaborative focus is what makes these compositions so enjoyable and the messages ever deepening  the disconcerting element that one can be left with after listening to the album is that the final note is so beautiful and emanates from a cello that is not by the hand of any of the three primary musicians  one may wonder if it is merely an apt conclusion to the best work the band has created or if the resounding note of resolution is signaling the end of what the band has lived and created with the hope they have given enough|1
nothing they make today beats raffi my three year old daughter adores these songs its fun to listen to what i heard when i was little too i am not a fan of kids music and movies in general but raffi is at least more bearable than most this is a good price for three cds|1
simply amazing that after 40 years and 20 studio albums that they could come up with something as fresh and energetic as this  im not going to get into a track by track review as many have but i will say that taken as a whole this album is fantastic  ive read a few of the negative reviews and there literally are just a few and cant understand them  especially for those that claim to be rush fanatics  anyone claiming to be that simply cannot trash this one  one of them even mentioned that geddy lee should go listen to some billy joel releases to figure it out  billy joel give me a break  what the hell is someone like that doing reviewing a rush release  go pull out those old stale bj big shot records and have yourself a good time  this is for serious music fans who know and appreciate where rush is coming from and where they are going  i defy anyone to pull out a 20th studio release from any band not that too many have survived long enough to put that many out and compare it to this and not conclude that these guys still are putting out stellar music that is relevant and musically without peers  the other guys rolling stones anyone they just keep on touring on the back of the stuff they put out 2040 years ago and could never dream of devoting an entire world tour to a new release  just buy it and enjoy|1
well the second album that the bboys put out that is counting from a nonus perspective was an instant success mainly because the first one had put them on the charts and now they could ride on filler songsthere are some good ones here mainly the infectious title track and the song missing you im not sure if its on this particular releasemine was from australia  but most of the songs are hopelessly weak youll likely tire of it very quicklyafter sweating for years in the underground and finally bursting onto the scene in 199596 with their first mainstream album bsb got lazy for this one and they went along with really empty songs for the second  unless you like overrepetitive radio pop with miserably loud drum tracks youll regret the 24 dollars you spentthey were frugal with their first attempt using both ballads and urban dance songs with many early mixes used in clubs the punchy almost discostyle first album could have sprouted the first seeds of those gay rumours that have plagued groups like this ever since and afterwards with millennium and now bb they have more melody to their songs  here there is neither fun nor seriousness just perfunctory crap|0
another stellar contribution to an already brilliant catalogue this stands up against all that came before and points nicely towards what may still come|1
pink floyd is one one of the most talented bands ever to play an areana  this album is really amazining the music and muscicianship showcases incredible lyricsvocals and muscinanship  this cd makes you think and will keep you locked in till you get to the only bad song waiting for the wormsthis album has a lot of different themes behind it which makes it fun to listen because you can listen and try to figure what the whold wall is really about if youre into floyd then you probaly have this but in youre a new fan then i highly recommend picking this up once again this is some incredible stuff  this has to be one of the best albums ever recoreded  bands today just dont make albums like this which is sad on mtv it seems that a lot of the bands today have the same style this is a concept album so that means that the songs run together so you have to listen to the whole thing  sure some of the songs couldnt be on the radio and some dont make sense but give it time you will love itpeace out to all my freakout friends|1
dr ebbetts cds are home made cdrs made from vinyl transfersim surprised to see this even hereive reported this bootlegshame on you for trying to take advantage of people|0
i have enjoyed this recording for many months contrary to some other comments i have always been able to look beyond the 1950s tape hiss sound and stage noises the voice sound is rather clear and directa few weeks  ago after being away from this package for a few months i removed a disc  for play only to discover that one track would not play upon further  investigation i found that a full 10 of the 14 discs were damaged some  would not even track at all a disgusting clouding similar in appearance  to ice cyrstals had formed on part or in some cases all of the surface  of the disc i believe this to be a flaw in the manufacturing process from  a factory in portugalbeware|0
i was very disappointed in the music on this cd and had ordered 2 copies  one for myself and one for a gift  the selections werent at all like what i had anticipated  i wouldnt recommend this to anyone else|0
based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews written here since the release of clockworks angels im hardly alone in my feelings about this disc for a band that released its first album 38 years ago have released another 19 or 20 if you count feedback studio albums since then and whose members are 5859 years old to release something even close to the majesty of clockwork angels in 2012 well like the review title says is this even legalthere is a ferocious immediate driving quality to this work title track bu2b and headlong flight are great examples balanced by some of the most melodic and emotional pieces theyve ever produced halo effect and the astounding the garden heck theres even a legitimate pop single or two in here the wreckers  wish them wellnot that radio will ever play themas a live band rush has been described to me by casual fans as playing each song like its the last time theyll ever get to and rocking twice as hard as bands half their age to me clockwork angels captures that essence perfectly with an edge thats been missing from their last few studio effortsrush fans have undoubtedly already bought this disc rock fans now its your turn to step up and experience true masters at work|1
i saw gardiner lead his orchestra in these two masterworks last week little has changedin the ensuing years and i fully agree with the comments by dv mostly superficial if well played with good ensemble gardiner had me thinking of original instruments under his baton as a bit of a gimmick he did at least wake up to lead a powerful rendition of the finale of the 5th with regard to the inane liner notes by david hurwitz this ass has no business being taken seriously as a critic his notes for this cd are sensible compared to something he wrote on his online site several years ago that bach and handel would have favored abortion and a womans right to choose i kid you not actually there is a consistency between the two both show hurwitz does not respect classical music|0

there is a certain subset of rush fans who fancy themselves armchair producers with perfect pitch who know how to properly engineer a real album  is it because they think that being a fan of such an accomplished group of virtuosos they have a special understanding of music  is it because they get all peter klaven on the weekend  these people need to crawl back into their basement conversions and keep pretending theyre special while they mix their tired municipal club bands latest demo on garage bandive always found it incredibly presumptuous when people think they could make a better guess than the band about producers engineering etc  there was a time when a band went into the studio and you probably didnt even know it and you heard a new album was on its way a month before and thats it  no internet speculation  you just bought the record and listened  thats what you need to do with clockwork angels  if you take that advice then dont bother reading any furtherthat said this is a wonderful album  ive listened to it in mp3 wav and flac in various settings computers 21 system ear buds studio monitors closed ear headphones and the car  it all sounds good  why  the songs kick ass and are among the best of their career  theres some awesome urgency and intensity in the tunes  in previous albums most from the late 80s90s the band would just hold back and let a safer poppier arrangement rule but with clockwork angels they go for it in a riproaring fashion  some of the melodies are really catchy and the chorus from the title track is a real ear worm the range of the album is impressive grungy on bu2b ethereal on the garden shades of bytorbastille on headlong flight  everything fits together well  i like that this album doesnt sound like snakes  arrows or moving pictures or hemispheres  rush proves itself by progressing  progressive music doesnt mean noodling in weird tunings and times it means moving beyond your last work and creating something newconsidering how long the band has been together with only one personnel change rutsey rip at their very beginning its truly awesome that they can still put it together sure there have been some ups and downs over the years and every fan has their best and worst songs list and i doubt we all agree  imho this record stands out among their best  i think the best review if heard is the interview billy corgan did with geddy and alexto qualify myself i love rush from fly by night through power windows including caress of steel they lost me after that but got me back with vapour trails to now with a few cuts off of counterparts and test for echo  there are three records i chose to ignore and will try to never listen to again and the first album is well the first album|1
just when you thought that album rock was dead four of the baddest mothers on the planet get together and made a rip your heart out rock n roll album the songwriting the playing  hell there are three musicians here who are considered among the best on their instrument of all time  production and recording and maybe more than anything a feeling of a band jelled tight and in in psychic communication with each other this might just be the best album any of these guys ever played ona supergroup to be sure but perhaps never before in rock history has a super group been such a cohesive unit these guys had a huge hit album in 2009 which hit the charts at number three and almost immediately went gold it contained if just barely the highoctane hook laden singles oh yeah sexy little thing and my kinda girl from there they embarked on a string of live shows that ended a year later they proved with that one album that a super group could do more than show case four super star virtuososduring that whirlwind tour as hagar put it we went from being a weekend funtime thing to making a record and touring the world our learning curve was fast  even for uswe earned everything we got and along the way we established a trust in one another that happens rarely in bandsso chickenfoot set out to make a high minded heart pounding follow up they did it right they challenged each other to be even better and that is exactly what they accomplished theres a cohesiveness on this album that demands that it be listened to in its entirety dont get me wrong there are plenty of tunes that will no doubt be radio favorites make great singles but to really appreciate it listen to it all the way throughthere is bluesy ballsy stadium rock there is earth quaking riff driven monstrous rock anthems there are bone crushers but with a spiritual undertone theres also biting sarcasm and social commentarytheeres joe satriani at his shredding best there is michael anthony at his lowdown best and chad smith everywhere he should be and there is sammy hagar singing in ways i am not sure i ever heard him singthere are great rock ballads country dipped pop and straight ahead classic rockmost of all this is album rock that will take a long time to get old|1
i dont usually like bands as much with female lead singers but this one is great she does a great job and the whole cd rocks from start to finish the cd isnt over produced like alot of music these days so if you saw them in concert they would live up to your expectations and more|1
because she writes such entertaining humorous lyrics its easy to overlook the more serious and introspective side of singersongwriter christine lavin this recording  is a good balance between her comic and  poetic sides her loopy sense of humor comes through on cuts like the title  track since i first heard it ive never been able to hear the word  sushi without thinking of christine and on mysterious  woman when shes funny shes very very funnywhen lavins not  feeling funny her songs are so wistful poignant or heartwarming that  they will sway even the most detached listener eightyfive  degrees is such a lovely melody with elegant orchestration that it  almost doesnt matter what lavins singing about the subtle  messagethat  friendship and genuine concern can come from the most unlikely sourcesis  a perklavin has assembled a talented cast of backup musicians for  this recording including john gorka bill and janice kollar also  responsible for the arrangements and the members of uncle bonsai they  and the many other musicians shes recorded with over the years  a  veritable whos who of contemporary folk music complement but never  overshadow the bright star in center stagemaybe its a good thing  he cant read christines mind but im sure glad i got a peek  into it you will be too|1
is worth having the album his songs about hank williams and robert johnson are tremendous his other albums are excellent but i personally like this one the best rip my friend|1
my kids and i have much enjoyed this recording but the narration is often too quiet and sounds a bit muffled  moreover the narrator speaks with a british accent making comprehension a bit trickier for little ones  in general i have missed the sound quality obtained in digital recordings so im now shopping for a better recording of this wonderful piece of music|0
i did not get this soundtract and it was not available in the cloud eitherwhy do you need more words|0
at the improv in dc i worked with brian and his brother dennis i had seen  brian on every comedy show and ive been a huge fan for years every comic  says the same thing as expected he was great live the man in 100  comedian dennis is hysterical too both were cool offstage also the had  not worked together in years anyway do yourself a favor and see regan  live or take the next best thing and listen to the cd it was totally cool  to work with them now quit watching lame sitcoms and go support live  comedy you are missing some great acts|1
michael w smith provides  wonderful contemporary chrismas music it is a perennial favorite with our family i bought this for our daughter who wanted another copy|1
i thought the album since it is their latest would contain more songs like they did at their concert in england slashs hometown it only contained two i really loved the concert they did at the guitar center in la that was great as a gnr and velvet revolver fan i guess i was expecting something a little different maybe their next album will contain the lost songs like starlight etc|0
i bought this cd just for one song happy worker i would give more stars if i could have just downloaded it via amazon mp3|0
las liricas es lo unico que vas a encontrar diferente de cancion a cancion  los metales suenan igual el piano igual el bajo igual etccada cancion individualmente es una cancion chevere y el estilo es muy bueno pero la combinacion de las quince es imposible y ridiculo  mas variacion es necesaria y porque no hicieron un intento de variar su ritmo no importa que buena sea una cancion que saquen en la radio nunca comprare un disco de ellos|0
im surprised at how many negative reviews there are herethey are more than welcome of course since everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion but this album sounds so killer that i was sure it would receive more universal acclaim well to me its an absolute stunner all killer no fillerthat phrase can be applied to this album more than any new album ive bought in some time while offering some variety in musical styles heresongs with a touch of punk some with a touch of melodic pop metalall with a basis in good ol hard rockthis album is a musically cohesive and well produced body of work and i daresay is slashs best effort since gnrs appetite for destruction the songs here sound fresh and new without ripping off other songs yet retain that hard rock edge of gnr slash dishes out plenty of incendiary solos and myles kennedy has really come into his own as slashs vocalist what a range that guy hasi am not missing axl at all here some say slash just isnt slash without axl but myles is his own man and fits into slashs music as well as axl did imo i really liked slashs last cd and while having all the guest vocalists on that one was an interesting move i thought the cohesiveness suffered a bit as a result needless to say for me apocalyptic love is a little better than his last album and thats saying somethingand not just because its more cohesive its the songs themselves the songs on this cd are so good i thought ok what outside writers did slash utilize for his material here i looked on the cd notes and nope noneall written by slash and myles with the partial exception of one tune contributed to by the producer eric valentine who btw did a great job of producing and mixing this album amazingslash and myles just knocked it out of the park herei know i sound like a fan boy here but i have listened to this cd multiple times to make sure it really is as good as i thought it was after the first listenlol as far as im concerned this is the album that picks up where appetite left off anyone who thinks slashs creative juices dried up long ago is sorely mistaken indispensable for all slash velvet revolver and gnr fans|1
this is a wonderful album  i happen to enjoy communist propaganda music and was especially delighted when i saw that it had been produced in 1976 just at the end of the cultural revolution  how i envy those like the carawans who got to chinajust as it opened up  my first visit was in 1990 and i always had the feeling i got there too late  this really is a small treasure and a gift to us from these musicians from a china that doesnt exist anymore  i dont know much about guy and candie carawan but i see that the royalties from this album go to theuschina peoples friendship association the song titles arecharming and only best appreciated in the historical contexti would love to find more music from this period such as the east is red  socialism is good  without the communist party there would be no new china  that sort of thing|1
i purchased this album with great enthusiasm the choice of instruments playing is very disappointing overpriced for the performance quality|0
ive been a rabid rush fan since i was a kid but i admit rush has been an acquired taste for many listeners this new album will definitely gain rush  a wider fan base for surefavorite songs caravan clockwork angels the gardenmy wife whom i love despite the fact that she hated rush after seeing them on the clockwork angels tour and hearing this album is now a fan a must listen rush rocks like no other band i know|1

if you have not yet experienced chickenfoot what rock have you been living under the second effort from this supergroup is even better than the first there is not a single track on the album that does not hitthe sound is remniscent of hagar era van halen with better guitar work eddie is good but joe is better without a doubt joe satriani has every lick of eddie van halen and a whole lot more that eddie doesnt all i can say to the reformed dlr van halen is that their new album better not suck chickenfoot is putting out music better than anything van halen had put out in decades michael anthony takes it over the top with his signature backing vocals and solid bass riffsive got love for the vh folks but wolfgang is no michael anthony and as anyone who heard van halen 3 knows eddie is not a good songwriter hopefully david lee roth will bring some legitimacy back to vh but in the meantime if you want all of the great sounds with none of the drama chickenfoot is the band to follow and chickenfoot iii is the record to buy|1
not many people would argue that the true test of quality and especially in music is time considering that the wall was released in 1979 and is still so popular speaks volumes that is particularly true for this album especially since it is not a mainstream commercial pop music and the band was not selected by a marketing guru who knew how to target the right market using the right channels this is a music written by 4 cambridge educated talented people whose aim was to write a real music about real feelings the album is full of originallity which can be matched by few other bands if you are an educated person who can readbetweenthelines and understand the full complexity of this music it will touch you and more you listen to it more you appreciate it more you want to know the story behind the album but if you are looking for an easy music just to have fun well then this is not for you personally i think this is undoubtably the best music album ever written closely followed by the dark side of the moon|1
i have waited long and hard since nov 78 for something that could at least tie with hemispheres the 34 year wait makes this album all the more sweet for me i give the recording  its just due for the nice guitar bass mix for starters infact  lees bass is everywhere like it belongs in rush alexs lead guitar for the first time i can recall has a live quality in the mix this kept me tuned carefully to each track listening more intently than any other studio recording thus far|1
i bought this cd at a thriftstore glad i only gave a dollar for it im giving it one star for ocean waves and thunderstorms autumn breeze|0
this is a very poor compilation of italo disco faves fun fun as it only contains short versions of their hits and is therefore a waste of a cd this is dance music and no italo fan wants to hear 3 minute versions you dont even get to see any pictures of the lovely girls themselves on the cover the tracklisting amazon have posted is wrong heres what you really getone day 556baila bolero 356gimme some loving 344color my love 358happy station 317capital girl 345give me your love 355could this be love 358give me love 410fun fun hitmix medley 540update note the amazon tracklist has now been corrected as you can see only one song one day is a long version and its the flop that nobody has ever heard of very poor so my advice would be to get the hot productions best of fun fun cd instead which is also for sale on amazon|0
on this 1969 recording travelling jazzman dexter gordon is surrounded by  an alldutch rhythm section made up of cees slinger piano jacques schols  bass and han bennink drums  this album was recorded live at the  amsterdam paradiso which used to be a church  the sound is a bit rough  about what you might expect from a decent bootleg so its a bit rough  around the edges at times but then so was gordons blowing  versions of  standards like willow weep for me and scrapple from the  apple all rather lengthy as was the gordon way of doing things  live are coupled with originals like sticky wicket here  titled junior and fried bananas which would be  recorded for prestige some time later in the same year and which remained  favorite blowing vehicles for gordon for the remainder of his career  diehard fans will enjoy this cd but the casual listener had better look  elsewhere for the best in dexter gordon|0
i gave als in 3d album 4 stars but im giving this one 2 stars because i find this one to be verry stupid no really|0
finnish composer jean sibelius has put together a fine group of pieces together in this wonderful collection of classical works her playing has the same range of emotion that the most esteemed vocalists can emit two rondinos op 68 i and ii are great examples of the feeling put into these works they have power drawn from the romantic era but the structured beauty of the classical jean sibelius compositions for piano works lacks no elements of beauty or feeling that should shine through on art such as this matt m and the  reviewer team|1
the first pass through this cd was honestly just ok the second pass through was like rediscovering it all over and most definitely almost an instant classic in my eyes tracks are very up beat and live while some really make your emotions turn like not for me you can feel the emotion is myles voice and it just makes you feel it too truly a very versatile duo with excellence throughout the lp this album truly has something for everyone with tracks that echo journey like we will roam and new age feel title track apocalyptic love overall an excellent balance and worth every cent this duo has made me a believer with their original content and am looking forward to album 2|1
christel nani is inspiring her cds and books offer insightful practices transforming your archetypes offers not only new perspectives for selfawareness but also suggestions of what to do about uncharted corners of ones own selfimage she explains how our reactions to our personal archetypes can be not only the illusions that we live by but more importantly can be the roots of our illnesses she is excellent|1
while listening to the solos and duets of jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy on recent tv movies of the two stars i thought i would enjoy a cd of their vocal talentswrong the sounds are shrill and the volumes are misregistered really  a disappointment if the songs are remastered from the originals forget it a good cd of both performers would be great to enjoy but not this particular cd|0
this twodisk anthology of her early recordings offers a good selection but what makes this album special is a delightful graphic novella dramatizing an event from her prekrupa days she forgot some lyrics when fronting raymond scotts band in 1940  the incident is recounted in her autobiography lthigh times hard times|1
our entire family enjoys the cd grown kids and young kids get a kick out of raffis soothing voice and fun songs|1
probably the worst score cd i ever did purchasei bought it for 8 in an hmv clearance sale as in no one was buying this trash on saturday november 7th 1998 which was quite a significant day for me as soon as i got home i loaded the cd into my player turned the lights off and munched on my leftoever pickmix from the cinemaonly to be mortifiednoise thats whats on this cd horrible screeching grinding din without an iota of grace or dignity its sad that there is only one good theme in this entire mess track 1 johns theme introduces chow yunfats character and promises that the meagre 37minute running time of this frisbee might be something special its a wonderful emotional theme that really stays with you but it only has a single other appearance in the score repeated almost verbatim in track 9 and its all completely undone by the aggravating noise that fills up the rest of this short albumit was with the replacement killers that i began to recognize the modern trend of blending the score with the sound design and needlessly perforating each cue with horible sound effects zimmers now defuct media ventures of which composer harry gregsonwilliams was a part popularized this lamentable method and this movie features it at its worst im not sure if gregsonwilliams is a man of notable talent who squanders it on whatever trashy approach is common at the time or a man of no talent who got lucky with one good theme here either way this coaster does not deserve to be given a homevarese sarbande album1 johns theme 02432 stalked 03583 the temple 02284 he means business 03165 kill or be replaced 02186 we have visitors 02117 john reflects 02048 surreal shootout 03579 john traps his man 034710 race against time 030411 the heavies arrive 025312 final confrontation 0338expanded score unreleased1 the replacement killers 8012 first approach 2173 confrontation 3454 meg coburn 1385 funeral 1506 kill or replaced 2217 we have visitors 2208 race against time 3159 john reflects 31510 stalked 44111 the temple 23612 john traps his man 34513 johns theme 25114 the heavies arrive 30115 surreal shootout 41216 he means business 32417 finally  end title 509|0
a very good cd particularly if you have young children  mccutcheons songs are entertaining and diverse|1
i thought i had purchased a blank cd at first  then i heard a few audible splashes that sounded like someone paddling a canoe an osprey call about 30 minutes into it very intermittent ducks quacking extremely softly 2  bird calls over the 50 minute track and thats about it  considering the  pleasant sounds on some of the other sounds of nature series ocean waves  the river summer nights etc this was a ripoff  i guess i expected a  more or less constant gentle lapping of lake waves on the shore to give  some continuity and some crickets or other insect sounds maybe just  maybeif you put on headphones  which i dont have and turn up the  volume you will hear numerous sounds on this cd but played on my computer  cdrom it was extremely disappointing  too soft too random cmon guys  at least give us a bit of intermittent reinforcement|0
i found this music to be very compatible with the tai chi for arthritis dvd programi use it regularly for warm upexercise and cool downwould definitely recommend it as a companion to the dvd|1
i checked this cd out from the library and im so glad i did before wasting my money on thismiss saigon is a terrible story full of phony emotions with a static unsatisfying score the music lacks variety and is forgettable in other words many of the songs sound the same the story is a cliche romeoandjuliet type with starcrossed lovers who go through so much when they hardly even know each other and on top of it the singing isnt that goodi cannot comprehend why everyone is so fascinated with lea salonga her voice is so weak and she tries hard to sound strong but it just doesnt sound goodi have never liked jonathan pryce with his moretalkthansing voice but the role of the engineer should have more gut and strengthsimon bowman sounds like a classicallytrained singer trying to sing in a pop style the two styles are completely different and should not be mixed because well it just sounds badclaire moore and peter polycarpou are the only two performers who demonstrate great vocal ability however their roles arent as big as that of kim the engineer or chris so even they couldnt save this doomed albumi know that this show was a huge success and many people love it but it just tries too hard to reach emotional depth that it just fails on so many levels|0
it seems to me that every rush cd is better than the last and this one is no exception  it rocks from beginning to end|1
the wall is one of the best albums produced by the greatest rock bands eversongs like comfortably numb have made this an evergreen hit which will sell for generations to comefive stars|1
clockwork angels has been an almost religious experience  the last time a new rush album grabbed me so hard was when i had to choose between an lp or an 8track  before it came out i felt a lot of apprehension that the lyrical subject matter would end up being too maudlin or introspective  instead most of the songs are hard rockers with intriguing story lines that take you into another world  yes there is some introspection woven within the storyline especially on the most beautiful track the garden but it is so well donemakes me feel 20 years old again i want to drive around in a yellow trans am windows rolled down blaring this out of my speakers|1
the decision for which album to base my first amazon review ontook awhile  there are literally close to 500 albums that i would like to say something good or bad about  after a little consideration i figured id start at the top and work my way down pink floyds monstrous epic the wall is the best album ever recorded in any genre anywhere ever  there are many great albumsthis happens to be the best one  there are too many close second finalists to even begin mentioning so dont get miffed over my overtly pretentious conclusionif right now your saying something like dylans blonde on blonde is better or the first ramones album blows it away or even worse linkin park rocks man you should pull the plug on all audio devices at your disposal and take up calligraphy as a hobby instead music just aint workin out for ya  this is the most ambitious elaborate and emotional undertaking by any group of musicians since the classical and romantic periods they didnt have the benefit of electricity  doesnt it rule  the wall is the brainchild of roger waters one of our planets most distinctive weavers of melody and lyric  with the creative accompaniment of distinguished guitarist david gilmour  he melds theme narrative and structure in a way never attempted before  and never since  the result is the most dynamic musical experience known to manthe albums protagonist and antagonist comes to us in the body of one central character   the infamous pink  hes not doing so well and hed be better off if he stayed back at the hotel  but he opted to guide us again into his bleak world of madness and emotional decay  pink is a composite of  waters own life experiences andmore poignantly   those of former cofounding bandmate syd barrett  the unbelievable writing arrangement and production of the album fluently guides pinks character arc as it unfolds and plummets like a fighter pilot  the story follows a semilinear structure with flashback sequences interspersed giving us backstory on pinks earliest traumatic experiences   the loss of his father in wwii  an overbearing mother and childhood illness  it achieves all of this masterfully while also exploring themes of fascism racism rejection and social disenfranchisementnovelists have 300  pages to achieve what waters conveys to us within the limited narrative structure of music  his chord progressions and lyrics evoke imagery and are heavily laden with metaphor the sound effects and overdubs found throughout the piece help to create unparalleled atmosphere and tone  the lyrics are delivered to us by the dueling pipes of waters and gilmour  the two voices accomplish an incredible contrast between opposite yet harmonious textures  waters voice representing the emotionally loaded ego of pink tinkering on the brink of insanity   and gilmours representing the peace and comfort outside the wallthe album is a 26 track remasterpiece whose smallest achievement is the fact that it has spawned 6 classicrock radio gems  when these songs are taken out of the context of the whole symphony they lose a little something  i bought this album recently after only hearing it once over the last decade it was ridiculously played out in my singledigit and teen years  it has reawakened me to the complexity in art that man is capable of realizing  the albums classic status is so legendary that its almost comical  yet its reputation is well deserved  my only grievance with the remastered edition is that it does not include bonus tracks for when the tigers broke free and the superior version of empty spaces which are both featured in the film version  28 tracks would not have been overkill   in this case|1
this latest release could be argued is their best work ever  their musicianship is unparallelled in this album and the concept album is just perfect  saw them in concert this year in bridgeport  they were unbelievable  having the string group on stage with them was truly awesome and lent a different feel to their live performanceit was not a recorded back track but actual live performers on stage  very cool from the opening track caravan to the mind blowing heart touching conclusion the garden this album is just hit after hit for rush fans of all ages  i believe i read they are going to be recording 1 or 2 shows live for another dvdblu ray release  i will surely buy that when it comes out  i know these guys are getting up there in age but man they still can rock  congrats on finally getting inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame  i know they said it did not matter to them but i think something inside is saying finally  they sound like they will graciously accept the honor and if there is a rr hof induction concert and they are playing i know i will do my best to watch|1
brian regan is a comedian that im not afraid to share with my kids  the whole family constantly es him around the house|1
elaine paige has a wonderful voice  this cd shows off her talent|0
i dont think i can say anything about this album that hasnt been said a good hundred times its great one of their best and number four in their phase of five perfect albums in a rowthough it does have a weak point or two what shall we do now from the film and the wall live should have not been cut from the album also i really hate another brick in the wall part 2 it should not have been their only number one hitwhy do people diss on vera and bring the boys back home so much i think their terrific the playing on vera is enough to get you to forgive the track for rogers poor singing on the tracki think my favorite piece on the album is one never played on the radio waiting for the worms has such great atmosphere to it how could one not love it its a really terrifying song when you think about itget this album unless you hate hearing about rock stars petty problems youll love it|1
i really enjoyed bear familys robert mitchum twofer that man and immediately bought this disc when i saw it first of all the content is lighter weight than his other albums these tracks from his early filmwork are great for the mitchum fan but someone wanting to actually investigate the mans singing ability should be directed to that man or calypso is like so my complaint and the reason i didnt give it a higher rating is the packaging i thought it was beautiful when i first opened it a shiny gatefold cardboard package with a clear disc tray and a gorgeous book full of movie posters and a complete filmography with lots of great info then the tray fell off of the cardboard backing then the pages started falling out of the book the whole thing literally fell apart on me for a pricey import disc such as this its totally unacceptable maybe i just got a defective one but im not willing to plunk down another 22 bucks to find out if you feel you must buy this disc a word of caution handle with care|0
what in the world  tony iommi puts on another great solo show i dont care what they say this isnt black sabbath with his sledgehammer riffs but martins lyrics are really pushing the edgei guess its a satan hero worship thing with himwhy iommi allowed this kind of imagery i dont knowozzy and geezer really let tony i have it after the release of this discthe rewards of hell  have mercy|0
i avoid reviewing dead losses but ive been going through kurt sanderlings sibelius cycle from the seventies disc by disc it begins with an anomaly an eyeopening sym 1 that promises great things to come for the most part nothing great happens the third is quite enjoyable but the conductor seems totally at sea in this installment the entire cycle covers a number of years form 1970 to 1977 and it seems that the later you go the more listless the performances ive never heard a more aimless sibelius fourth than the one here from 1977 which is full of dispirited playing from the berlin sym never better than an alsoran orchestra at their besti hope for better from the 1971 account of sym 5 which after all is a repertory staple but sanderling sleep walks through it too so the entire program has no bright spots in short a cd to avoid|0
before i go into too much detail about why this is such a terrible album i should mention that i have nothing against pink floyds other albums  in fact id already heard three of their albums before this one and they were all innovative epic pieces of work  however it seems that whenever an artist does anything truly innovative they reach a point where they become so selfindulgent in their own ambition that packaging and granduer become more important than the music itself  at the same time fans and critics desperate to retain their artistic image fall for it and lose sight of the fact that the music is dull and lacks any substance  another classic example is rick wakemans journey to the center of the eartheven at the beginning of the album you can see some of the bands originality slipping away  in the flesh has sort of an arena rock feel and its predictability is a considerable let down after the powerful opening  the thin ice is based on the classic 50s rock 34 progression and hardly even develops into a full songat the happiest days of our lives the album almost begins to take shape but when the vocals come in the song goes to hell  there is practically no melody and when there is the constant whining that is supposed to be singing actually prevents you from discerning individual notes  and that is the sound they have chosen for the entire album the sound effects dont help either this is not progressive rock  this is art rock trying to cash in on the disco crazemother is another generic pop song not nearly as special as people think this is about where it occured to me that all the classics on this album are actually the only ones that are developed enough to even be called a songabout half of both of the next two tracks are made of sound effects and something resembling dialouge so young lust is a welcome break developed themes decent singing no sound effects drawing out the length of the song but you can rest assured that wont continue one of my turns appears to be some attempt at acting and while the idea is conveyed once again it is too taxing to the music to be worth it honestly waters theres frantic and theres just plain whinyhey you is the best song on the album  for once the cold sad feel actually works to their advantage if it werent for this song i probably wouldve never finished the albumthe next few songs are as predictable as the rest of the album and then theres comfortably numb  this historymaking song has almost no singing but has a lot of speaking with too much inflection think along the lines of rex harrison from my fair lady  fortunately for him my fair lady had a plot  the other half is a sort of new age ballad  from here on the album suddenly turns 80s on us run like hell and waiting for the worms had a definite new wave vibe to them  here you are forced to ask yourself as pleasant as this is compared to the rest of these songs is there anything special about new wavethe trial is worthy of special mention  this song is just plain funny the 30 seconds that this website allows you should be enough to let you know just how much of a pathetic attempt at drama this is id like to e a passage from this song and i am not making this upjudge the way you made suffer your exquisite wife and mother fills me with the urge to defecatecrowd no judge dontoh by the way if you look in the sleeve you find out that the judge is actually a giant ass with a wig on  artistic no2 discs later we are left with a load of several boring pop songs undeveloped fragments of songs that could potentially be interesting and sound effects and whiny vocals that are supposed to illustrate this mans tragic lifeall in all its just another piece of crap masquerading as artthis album sucks|0
i bought this a few years ago in a cutout bin for around 5 i had never heard of the group before but when i went to queacutebec this summer i made sure to take it with me many of the tracks show irish influences as queacutebec was a destination for hundreds of irish immigrants during the 19th20th centuries some of the songs showcase the unique queacutebeacutecois choral style others such as beluga are original compositions or interpretations a wonderful taste of queacutebec music from a very talented band i love the brass sectionit really gives it an extra kick|1
the first and last items on the disc are the best things here  non pui andrai from figaro and falstaffs honor monologue  but in general terfel is trying too hard to make every word count and as a result he doesnt sing enough  can he sing  you bet he can  his vagabond song recital and his schubert song album are very good and you should hear him in the rodgers and hammerstein album and theres a marvelous they call the wind maria on another album  he was only 29 when this recording was made and hes trying to be the impressive interpreter  so theres too much crooning and shouting and not enough expressive legato singing  its as if hes trying to make up for not being on stage by acting with the voice and it doesnt work  i also think that hes too closely recorded and as a result the voice has an edge to it and the vibrato at forte moments is exaggerated  compare his scintille diamant with rameys for example  and compare ramey in early verdi  silvas aria from ernani say  with terfels macbeth aria on this disc  no contestmake no mistake  terfel is a great singer with a great voice and hes a vivid actor on stage  he has made many fine recordings  lets chalk this one up to experience|0
there are only about 24 songs worth having on this cdnot worth it i downloaded it so there was no going back once i bought it|0
i just ordered this cd to complete my michael w smith collection  after  hearing everything he has done before and after this album i wasnt  expecting this cd to go above and beyond the normal excellence of a smith  production  and some might argue that it doesnt  but somehow i feel that  this one is special  i have been a christian since i can remember and am  18 now but as i listened to this album for the first time a few days ago  there was a tugging at my soul  keep in mind i have every other cd of  michaels excluding the xmas records and many of his songs are touching  however this cd made in 1984 moved me like nothing before  i have  longed to hear a song about christs second coming so earnest as i am  sure  all i need to say is an extremely sentimental and  thought provoking love ballad the whole album is fantastic and most of it  is very praise oriented and up beat  a way is a nice energetic  anthiem with great harmony  i think my favorite song might be im  up  the words express the high that we get off of salvation and  gods love  this record is truly one of a kind  buy it and be happy  god  bless smitty|1
just kidding of course  the jingle cats sing all their own lyrics although the use of backup singers snowball and fluffy certainly help deliver a broad range of rich feline tones lacking in the jingle cats first  holidayinspired record easter cat is coming to town here we see the  success of that first album forced record execs to give into the cats  desire to experiment with meewe and meyau sounds in addition to their  basic but improved meow  unfortunately the overly dramatic buildup  throughout i want a clean litter box for christmas proves to be  overkill lessening the emotional impact potentially felt by its haunting  lyrics  before this prevents you from purchasing this album this  reviewer also thought the harmony hounds were musically immature and we  all know how well theyve done|0
music is very subjective and i dont by any means think flyleaf is a top tier music producing act but what they do have is an ultratalented front woman my impression of lacey moselys vocal talents is she could probably go solo and sing any genre and have a very long and productive career i think it is interesting that they get labeled as christian rock band when their lyrics certainly dont seem to slant that way perhaps we should label all our politicians as christian senators and congressmen etc since 95 are of that religion and they certainly seem to bring it up at the drop of a hatwhat i would like to point out to those who might only be aware of the audio cd before rerelease is the excellent acoustic tracks that are available with the mp3 downloads i didnt think much of them when i first downloaded from amazon but taking a listen to them recently they are quite impressive they isolate the vocal quality and ability of lacey perfectlyoverall i would give this album 3 stars but with the inclusion of the acoustic tracks it scores a 4|1
wow i think this disc is actually better than the first chickenfoot album satch is my favorite guitarist of all time and van halen is one of my favorite bands of all time i really get sick of hearing the term van hagar as if sammy is responsible for dismantling that band van halen was as good with sammy as they were with roth musically they just got better and better lets face it ed is responsible for all of vhs woes it had nothing to do with the singers the fact that michael anthony finally bailed on the vh brothers should tell you something i mean really is there anyone cooler than michael anthony anyway getting back to chickenfoot these guys rock i seriously laugh when i read some of the reviews criticizing hagars religiouspolitical lyrics really i mean really there are a lot of bands that are much more overtly political than chickenfoot in terms of religion who cares really hagar believes what he believes you can agree with him or you can disagree with him this is rock and roll this band exists to rock and thats all that really matters when sammy was in vh he said that he considered his voice as an instrument in and of itself if you dont agree with sammys message you can at least respect his voice as one of the best in rock when i think about the greatest hard rockheavy metal singers of the last twenty years i think about ed vedder chris cornell dave mustaine and sammy hagar and when were talking about chickenfoot hagar is just one of four outstanding musicians satriani anthony and smith are icons in and of themselves there is just no way i can express how special satriani is to instrumental guitar music there are lots of technically skilled guitarists but when it comes to guitarists who have a true sense of great musical composition there is joe satriani and steve morse the fact that joe satriani is in an actual band just makes me smile  it just proves to me how humble this guy is the latest chickenfoot album simply rocks and this is its purpose|1
i dont have to hear someone drop an f bomb or an mf in order to know something is funny  that is really adolescent humor  regan tells the same kind of funny stories that all the fbombers tell but without the cursing  he proves you can do it clean and still be funny|1
this is a great album that rush has put out it has the complete thought and story line that i felt snakes and arrows was lacking the sound is almost uniquely rushs with mixes of some modern influences lightly placedit is absolutely necessary to read the lyrics and storyline provided in the liner notes to understand the story in the album fully so make sure and buy this in cd form to get the booklet|1
ive been reading all of the reviews and personally i think ive gained just one thing music is a touchy subject almost everyone can relate to music in some way and because of that that is why there are so many types of music personally i couldnt care less for bob marley and all the reggae but some of my friends worship that music diversity is the keypink floyd is one of those bands that isnt simply just a band pink floyd is a band that is also an inspiration now on here you have reviews which are ultimately opinions of course youre going to get your handful of  this sucks or this bites or dont waste your money on this trash but to be honest if thats all you are going to write then dont waste your finger strength typing a reviewthis album is a very good example of diversity its pure rock its like when you heard your first eagles song or your first beatles song its just like that once you hear it you are addicted you may grow out of it it may be a phase but it also might not be  the wall was like that for me i actually listened to the title track first the wall was such a weird song i thought at first i had downloaded it unknowingly thinking it was a different song by a different artist but i took the time and listened past the odd flowing and yet kind of unexplainable lyrics and sounds at the beginning then i realized that it wasnt just weird words it was beautifullt3if you have ever heard an electronica song  you know the fast beats and repetitive yet kind of cool noises with barely any words you know how it feels to be listening to soundsand the few words that electronica songs have and kind of be overwhelmed i think one amazonian said it best when heshe said one listen just isnt enough well its true one listen isnt enough my love for the band pink floyd started with against the wall part 2 i asked my dad who of course knows more about classic rock than anyone i know told me it was the wall and of course now that i know the real title id say its an easy mistake to make but i searched for the wall and ended up getting the wall or the title track i love this album as it would be old and tiring and repetitive to do paragraph after paragraph about the likes and dislikes of each song like some people did in their reviews i am not doing it if you want to see what they are like and see what you think of them go right ahead youll see the nice little song list up farther on the page it would be judgmental and selfish of me to give my opinions of each song and even more annoying if youd listen to them so since you are the one buying listen to them yourselfi am  and i am a girl so go ahead right now tell me i dont know anything about music tell me im soooo wrong but really it isnt what one thinks of the music that makes the review its what everyone thinks compiled and sorted so you can really make your own decision|1
to me the allegretto though not an allegro needs to be taken much faster than bernstein doesin essence i hear and feel this as shostakovich doing a scherzolike parody of a mahlerian austrian laendler slow movement if you listen to a good interpretation of this symphony in this movement or listen through and below a notsogood performance youll soon grasp thisbernstein occasionally gets the drive of a parodic dance rhythm but its often just too slowand in the finale yes the allegro is tagged with the non troppo modifier but not rushed does not mean dragged out nor does majestic mean put the brakes onunfortunately does any of this surprise you this is lennythe older he got the more inconsistent and even bombastic he becamethe cello concerto is very good under ormandys direction and yoyo mas performancei wavered between two and three stars but finally fell on two|0
do not read this review if you are interested in a cd version i am reviewing vinyl reissue but amazon pushes reviews from different issuesversions together which causes a lot of confusionto start with  abbey road to me is one of the top 3 albums ever made i only rated the vinyl reissuei recently rediscovered vinyl after almost 2 decades of cd collecting and i have to admit now that i wasted my time and money on almost 500cd collection almost any vinyl record sounding so much better than a cd i spent 350 on a standalone cd player and about the same for a brand new turntable both hooked to same amplifier  and the sound of the most recent remastered cd and vinyl pressing from before cd era of the same album is incomparable in favor of vinyl please note  i am talking about the precd era pressingunfortunately most of the recent reissues on vinyl that i purchased are sounding pretty poor even compared to a cd examples band on the run capitol vaults and hot rocks by rolling stones sound just like the cd versions and hard days night let it be and abbey road actually sound worse than 1987 cds disappointment with abbey road was so big that i just returned it to the record shop for a fraction of the price and bought the 1969 version of the vinyl instead and it was definitely the best sounding version of abbey road i have ever heard bottom line  if you want a good vinyl of abbey road  stay away from this reissue and try to find one of the earlier pressings the earlier  the better the price well worth it15september09 comment just compared my 1969 vinyl with the 090909 remaster of abbey road  the vinyl still sounds better  more clear and deeper than a remaster however if your choices are a new vinyl the one i am revieweing here or a remastered 090909 cd  go with the cd|0
first youll notice that goebel did not include the ouverture number 5 on this cd if you want to listen to it youll have to buy the concerti per lorchesta di dresda musica antiqua koln r goebel 1995 archiv 4476642 louverture numeacutero 5 is the most curious disorienting and frantic piece i ever heard from veracini after listenig to the latter i decided to buy the other ouvertures of veracini which are on this cd trully i was disappointed why  because this mucic gives me headaches and make me irritable the main problem is that the movements are repetitives sometimes i thought it was a perfect replica of the previous movement goebel should have recorded some concertos of veracini and incorporated them between the ouvertures the result would have been perhaps less aggressive for the listenernow the good points the sound is rich deep and the orchestra play with great autorithy|0
i always thought that a soundtrack of a motion picture would include all the music played during that motion picture apparently this is not the case i was really looking forward to hearing carol of the bells and white christmas by the drifters but they are not on this cd nor are any of the other songs i guess the secret is to look for the words various artists to ensure getting the soundtrack this cd contains only the music written especially for the movie so you better watch out you better not cry|0
this release by vp sounds terrible like it was recorded off a warped tinny old cassette or something they shouldnt be allowed to sell it like this its a shame this classic album isnt available in a better audio quality|0
as an ardent and lifelong fan of cinema and all things horror i had been looking for the soundtrack to this film for quite some time i was quite excited to see it pop up as a you might also enjoy response to a previous amazon purchase although more than a little daunted by the pricebut i figured what the heck im still listening to the psycho soundtrack after four years ill certainly get my moneys worth out of it boy was i wrongfirst the liner notes are in japanese  and only the track names were in katakana so i couldnt make heads or tails of anything but the titles tubura beruzo tubular bells etc yes its an import but if you were hoping for insider insights from the packaging better brush up on your kanjisecond the tracks are exactly what the cd title says musical excerpts all the cuing level dynamics etc are intact  these are not the evenly modulated source recordings of the score they are the nondialogue nonsoundeffects sound tracks from the movie with all the stops and starts and dynamics added on top of the original recordings to suit the action in the movie for long periods at a time there will be extremely low or even no sound coming from your speakers when friedkin was putting the sound track together he wanted periods of absolute silence to creep out the audience to this end he not only recorded nothing onto the sound track he had the engineers put tape over those portions of the celluloid so that there would be absolutely no audio output this is great and innovative cinematography but makes for a lousy cd  i really dont relish paying an arm and a leg for no audio data on a disc then in the space of about three nanoseconds the volume will swell to tweeterbusting levels i found myself forced to play remote jockey so much i could never sit back and enjoy the musicnone of this is to detract from the brilliance of the score and please note this is not a michael oldfield work as a previous reviewer described  he contributed the song everyone knows from the movie tubular bells but did not compose the film score all of these tracks successfully contribute to the films brutally suspenseful effect on the viewer but the tracks as delivered on this cd were never meant to be experienced independent of the visuals this is why smart marketers will put the original soundtrack on film score albums and put the original soundtrack on the disc in the first place so that people will know the recording is the original recording of the music and not the highly remixed version used on the actual filmso if you want to spend an hour jamming furiously on the up and down volume buttons of your stereo remote please be my guest and buy this cd but know that mine is collecting dust on a shelf where its been since immediately after the first listening if you are a true fan of the movie you probably have the dvd  check to see if your version has the music as an isolated track if so you have no need of this cdon a technical note for those of you postulating these level problems are the fault of my equipment i have a highend denon dolby surround receiver and a kenwood preamp and used my expensive sennheiser headphones to listen to the cd not sound engineerlevel stuff by any means but certainly good enough to be able to give a decent listen so i would have to fault the cd not the equipment in this case|0
we couldnt locate one of these in the us so i found this one and man did it fit my wifes hopes and expectations rush stands alone but to have this to go along with the memory of the concert is priceless|1
it is not real pink floyd  i like what another reviewer said pink fraud  when this cd was released i was one of the first in line and i kind of liked it  i really wanted it to be good and i wanted to ignore the facts  the fact is the emotional talented egotistical visionary great lyrical and essential part of pink floyd is gone  what was left is three great musicians with huge lifestyles that need to remain the same or get better  i guess in a way i cant blame them  they have something to market and it will sell  they have had a few bright spots  but other than that they hover right around or below mediocre|0
it is extremely worshipful  takes the season where i think jesus would like it to be  the true meaning in song|1
id have to say when i first picked up this cd at the mall i was interested but didnt know if it would be good or notit was better than i thought but theres just 1 problemtheres hardly any bass in any songs|1
just got done listening to a different kind of truthquite simply the new vh blows this album away this not even comparable  the main reason is because of the awful lyrics once again hagar pumps out childish repetitive and quite boring lyrics  sorry pal comparing yourself to zeppelin was just foolish doesnt surprise me though you have always been full of hot air  the band that has raised the bar is the mighty van halen  this is dreadfully awful a complete failure|0
this was the first capercaille album i bought ive since bought many others and love the band not just karen mathesons vocalsbut this cd was a huge dissapointment id heard some capercaille songs on compilation cds before i bought this and chose this cd because it had a large number of tracksthis is not the capercaille ive grown to love this cd isnt even what id call celtic folk there are about 3 or 4 decent songs on the album but the rest are a mix of keyboards synthesizers and echoey voices strange foreign and altogether nothing like i expectedif you are looking for a place to explore gaelic folk music ill always recommend capercaille but try from dusk till dawn instead i also recommend the band solas|0

like the previous reviewer i was a student at northwestern when this recording was made knew members of the orchestra and have great admiration for the cso  i bought this disk without recalling the controversy that surrounded barenboims bruckner  after listening to this disc i then remembered grousing by at least one trombone player and a woodwind player about barenboims bruckner  and having heard this disc i know all too well the reason for this grousingthe performances of the 4th and 7th are among the worst available  they are so bad that i would feel guilty listing my used copy for sale here  i am particularly fond of bruckners 7th and yet i almost ejected this disk after the adagio but a perverse desire to see how much worse it could get led me to continuethe previous reviewer is right that wild and idiosyncratic tempo variations are a problem  but thats not the worst of the problems  the performance is entirely lacking in crescendos accentuations or rubatos within musical phrases  everything just plods along lifelessly and mechanically  the worst example is the famous tuba passage near the end of the adagio  when wellplayed this passage is heartrending  barenboim treats it like an afterthoughtthe orchestra apparently believed that barenboim was faxing in his version of the 7th and so there are careless technical flaws aplenty in the playing particularly in terms of string intonation  this is totally atypical of the cso which normally exhibits in my mind unparalleled virtousity in its performanceswhat baffles me is why dg released this lame performance while abbados astonishing performace of the 7th with the vienna philharmonic languishes in their vaults without rereleaseall in all i would say that the skrowaczewski performance of the 7th on arte nova is the best current choice  and its onlyhere at amazon  dont let that price scare you  it is beautifully engineered the saarbrucken radio orchestra gives a worldclass performance and skrowaczewski extracts more epic grandeur and overwhelming pathos from the score than anyone else save abbado that ive ever heard|0
raffi is king of kids songs without a doubt i played them for my children my primary students and when i taught the mentallydisabled each group loved the singalongs classic music of all types never go out of date for any age or any group raffis 20th anniversary collection proves it|1
this is the kind of album that you cant really make its not just the music which is brilliant in itself but its the lyrics the arrangements and the whole concept together that makes it what it is everybodys heard  about this album and everybody should hear it its a milestone in  musichistory a symphony of rock|1
im sorry i didnt understand the early reviews better  while these maori favourites may be traditional their performances on this cd were anything but  they sound much like american folk songs of a certain era with very dominating acoustic guitar  so its a lot like listening to short american folk songs sung in a different language and not an authentic maori experience at all  they also tend to all sound alike  very very disappointing  ill continue my search for something much more like the real thing|0
this cd is great  i love how he puts down phonicsto survive april fools day last year i played comedy cds for my sixth graders  this was their favorite|1
i was very disappointed with the cds  there is nothing to indicate in the product description that many of the songs are not vocals by karen  had i known i would not have purchased this product|0
all i can say is that this is while not as good as dark side of the moon is still a very awesome album i own this and all i can say is that every song here is amazing hell you should buy this just because another brick in the wall part 2 is on this which is probably pink floyds most famous song that loser sunburnt albino aka henry mcpruter will burn in hell for insulting pink floyd unless hes joking then he doesnt deserve to live well maybe not that bad but he is still a retard pink floyd is the best band that uses a keyboard and thats still around other bands like metallica and acdc have died in the past few years but pink floyd still has it|1
awesome sammy and the guys keep bringing hands down better than the first chickenfoot release in my opinion sammys voice has never been better love the two part harmonies michael anthonys back ground vocals are great joes playing is great nothing over the top but clearly is very comfortable being in a band settingsome darker sides of the album which i like some people say it is a bit more main stream than the last but so what album of the year for me|1
a good cd for starting didjeridulovers but if you learn more of the instrument and if you listen to various artists such as david blanasi alan dargin adam plack and charlie mcmahon youll leave this cd in its case for a long time however its a relaxing meditationallike album for listening in the background especially the song awakenings sounds really good early in the morning|0
if youre like me and wanted to hear robert shaws interpretation of the beautiful mass for double choir by frank martinforget it  the interpretation is absolutely awful way to slow and completely devoid of feeling and flow  in some spots shaw blatantly disregards the pieces dynamic markings to the great detriment of the performance  frank martin a tremendous and underappreciated composer deserves far far better than this for a good interpretation of the mass get the rias kammerchor great production values or the westminster cathedral choir recording|0
and those keyboards no thanks i would recommend this more to a dokken or whitesnake fan than a fan of vintage black sabbath|0
this is a great set of raffi music  my son and i love listening to all three cds  i am so happy to have this set raffi has a classic voice  pleasant and soothing my fav song is sodeo on the second cd but all are great good mixture of classic songs original songs upbeat music lullabies instruments  great for singing and dancing|1
absolutely awsome the best pink floyd album on the planet ive worn out 3 albums of the wall in fours years|1
i saw flyleaf a few nights ago in baton rouge they opened for cold and 10 years did as wellawesome by the way  i bought there album that night and listened to it the next day  i was pretty impressed with the album  i see most people say the ep is better than the lpi may buy the ep because i like harder music  but the band is great laceys vocals are unique and pretty pleasing but the band is just awesomevery catchy music  all in all flyleafs debut album is a pretty good buy i got it for 10 and its well worth it and i recommend it  hopefully this isnt the last weve heard from the group and hopefully they continue to grow and make even better music in the future|1
i first heard them on the radio around january when their song im so sick played and at first i didnt know who made it but it was an awesome song  then snocore tour came around and poof there was flyleaf along the ranks of seether and shinedown headlining or something of the sorts  as i read through most of the reviews i noticed how maybe a very short amount of the reviews were a little harsh or somewhat ridiculing or overly analytic and i must say 2 things1 i fully disagree and2 calm the negativity down this is music not a blood transfusiontheir debut cd was unique and capturing some of which the likes of younger or perhaps less mature people might not be able to grasp i mean come on people this isnt some childish goth metal or whiny brokeback emo band or halfheard band that can only make it as far as headbangers ball on mtv2 in the wee hours of the nightmorning when everyones asleep theyre amazing and make great music not to mention have wonderful live performances and even an equal and mutual respect from an array of well known bands  not everyone out there has the mental capacity to know great music when they hear it but this band defies all boundaries and stereotyped closed minds and id recommend anyone to listen to their music and give their style a try  if not then ill see you on the other side from a distance youll only know as a musical future the likes of ridicule cant harm|1
this cd has a short quicktime movie which executes automatically when inserted into your computer  i couldnt figure out how to listen to the music tracks on my computer itunes and other software did not recognize the existence of any music tracks  i had some difficulty until someone told me to use windows media player  when i called amazon the customer service reps could not tell me this  the one star is reflective of this not the music just be forewarned|0
one of the greatest albums in the history of rock  this is a true concept album where every song flows from its predecessor its a journey into madness and depression  not an album to pick you up but brilliantly conceived nonetheless  in my judgment the greatest double album ever made  if you dont buy this album you cant have any pudding|1
while this album is a bit on the dramatic side and is a rock opera of sorts it is definitely a pink floyd classic not to be overlooked so many great songs on this album a real thrill from beginning to finish its just great and any fan of rockpink floyd should have it its a timeless classic|1
klemperer makes bach sounds like bruckner or wagner beeing so dark depressive and dramatic its very difficult to listen to the 3 cds in sequence this album is not a first choice i cast my vote on the gardiner  version neither an essencial recording but a curiosity how would bach  compose if he lived in late 19th century|0
ive now been listening to the album for over two months and as i learn its nuances it just gets better and better as several other reviewers have noted how many bands have been around for nearly 40 years and are still exploring getting better musically in terms of both technical skill and in composition not to mention selling out concerts just about anywhere they play you can count them on one digit they are the power trio and it is really amazing that three guys can create such amazing music like this let along perform itthe album cover shows a clock with alchemy and other symbols representing each of the songs with time a central theme the entire album tells a story  a megaepic of over 70 minutes but each song can still stand on its own musically if not lyrically1 caravan starts off the story in whats become a standard rush practice of having the most iconic song up front on the album its a tribute to the youthful longing for adventure and gettingoutofdodge a young man wants to escape the safe secure farm where he grew up it has a great stoptime riff for the verses an anthemic chorus somewhat reminiscent of dreamline on roll the bones and an instrumental breakbridge section that just flat out kicks ass to hear and to see live on the time machine tour video three topnotch musicians playing off of and supporting the others with a chemistry matched by few other groups2 bu2b has a very brief acoustic guitar and haunting voice intro before kicking into a pounding riff punctuated by a steam venting sound effect which they match with their steampunk stage setup on tour the song talks about the predominant beliefs of the society the protagonist was raised in  a very fatalistic belief system that kept anyone from questioning what they were brought up to believe the liner notes teaser for the song talks about the omniscient watchmaker who ruled  crown city the capital the protagonist travelled to with alchemistpriests vaguely like the priests in 2112 providing for every need not a very subtle hint at neils and probably geddy and alexs disdain for organized religion and contempt for those who never question anything the same attitude is shared by the protagonist as he learns more about life in the big city musically the song has a melody that doesnt seem like much initially but quickly gets stuck in your head no extensive solos in this one just solid rock3 clockwork angels takes the protagonist to the center of crown city to chronos square noticing the theme of time again where he sees the aforementioned clockwork angels  floating globes representing light sea sky and land  basically the four elements they are the visible symbols worshipped by those in the city but even they are beholden to the unseen watchmaker the music has a majestic sound to it that complements the reverence held for the angels  punctuated by a mocking bridge section with geddys voice distorted as he sings they lyrics  a partial biblical e lean not upon your own understanding which is attributed in the liner notes to proverbs 35 and innout milkshake and again mocks the fatalism of those in this perfectly ordered society4 no ordered society is complete without a villain  the anarchist the rhythmic lively music to me contrasts sharply with the dark character in the lyrics  to me it speaks of a deeply held contempt for the sort of behavior demonstrated by the worst of the pseudomarxistnihilist idiots who seemed to infest ows protests in larger cities last yeari lack their smiles and their diamonds i lack their happiness and love  i envy them for all those things i never got my fair share ofthe lenses inside of me that paint the world black the pools of poison the scarlet mist that spill over into rageanyway the anarchist could be a heath ledgers jokeresque character consumed by hate and envy who just wants to spread chaos through the city but again the music is an interesting contrast to that5 in the fifth song carnies the protagonist has taken a job working on a carnival kinda like neil did when he was young and one night amidst the busy crowds games dancers and performers he spots the anarchist planting a bomb and just as he shouts to warn the crowd the villain throws the detonator to him and disappears the crowds assume the protagonist is the guilty party and hes forced to flee the city the music starts off with an ominous sounding riff alternating with a lighter section that builds tension the chorus is built around the idea that you should be careful what you wish forhow i prayed just to get away to carry me anywheresometimes the angels punish us by answering our prayers6 halo effect backtracks a bit or its the protagonist reminiscing and introduces a little bit of love story  even if it turns out badly its a short ballad barely over three minutes led by alex with a melancholy acoustic guitar on the verses the protagonist becomes obsessed with a beautiful acrobat performer who doesnt share his feelings and he has to come to terms with the fact that he was just projecting his vision of a perfect soulmate onto the object of his infatuation  to be disappointed when she doesnt comes closeits so shameful to telljust how often i fellin love with illusions again7 in the next song the protagonist makes his way to the rough port city of poseidon seven cities of gold plays off of the old spanish legend  the unreachable untold cities of riches always forever just beyond reach but tortuously visible past a brutal wilderness described in the lyrics and hugh symes artwork that resembles the four corners area only colder the protagonist of course hears the stories and has to try to find them spending who knows how many months or years and ends up nearly freezing to death before having to return to poseidon8 in the wreckers the protagonist believes his luck has run out and catches a ship back home hes tired a bit older and has had his fill of adventure they get caught in a vicious storm at sea and get lost and when they see a signal light they believe theyre saved by some samaritans but it turns out its a trap to get ships to run aground so the wreckers can plunder the cargos and leave the poor passengers to drown in the waves musically the verses have a melody that reflects the tragedy of the passengers shattered hope with a chorus that reflects the protagonists growing disillusionmentall i know it that sometimes you have to be waryof a miracle to good to be trueall i know is that sometimes the truth is contraryeverything in life you thought you knewall i know is that sometimes you have to be warycause sometimes the target is youthe protagonist is the only survivor of the doomed voyage9 headlong flight has the protagonist presumably back home and safe reminiscing again about all the adventures hes had and in spite of how bad things may have seen from time to time that they all helped make him the person he became the chorus contains a tribute to neils mentor freddy gruberthe real test of a life welllived is whether you would do it all again musically this is the most kickass song on the album starting out with a killer bass riff from geddy before launching into a rocking 7minute fasttempo song that shows off geddy alex and neils jawdropping chopsit is going to be a blast to watch them play this one live10 bu2b2 is a short acoustic reprise of the first one but from a protagonist whos older disillusioned but wiser and despite still having the same disdain for the fatalists and their unquestioning beliefs he realizes his own refusal to share in their beliefs and his desire to continue living his own way in spite of all the challenges hes faced is itself a reflection of a kind of faith11 wish them well is a lesson the protagonist tries to teach  how you cant let those who dont agree with dislike or hate become a driving factor in your life those who are evil mean stupid or nasty simply arent worth spending any more of your energy than needed to get away and get them out of your life theres too much other cool stuff to dospirits turned bitter by the poison of envy always angry and dissatisfied even the lost ones the frightened and mean ones even the ones with a devil inside thank your stars youre not that way turn your back and walk away dont even pause and ask them whynot as fastpaced as headlong flight it has easy pace and an uplifting sound that reminds me a bit of some songs on the presto album but without that albums tinny sound12 the final song the garden i think its the most beautiful song rush has ever written it floored me musically it has geddy starting out singing the lyrics to an almost folksounding melody thats not quite like anything theyve done in any of their more ballady songs over the years with alex playing an acoustic in support then it builds with bass and then neil joining in on the drums and then it incorporates some piano and orchestral parts it has geddys best singing on the album and closes out with a gorgeous solo from alex the lyrics provide the finale to the theme of time and the unseen watchmaker behind the scenes as his final lesson the protagonist realizes that the meaning of his life boiled down to a quest for two very simple things from the liner note intro to the songlong ago i read a story from another timeline about a character named candide he also survived a harrowing series of misadventures and tragedies then settled on a farm near constantinople listening to a philosophical rant candide replied thats all very well but now we must tend our garden i have now arrived at that point in my own story there is a metaphorical garden in the acts and attitudes of a persons life and the treasures of that garden are love and respect i have come to realize that the gathering of love and respect  from others and for myself  has been the real quest of my life now we must tend our gardenit is a stunning song  i found myself playing this one several times throughconsidering several of the songs individually this would seem like a very dark album but as a whole i find the story and the music as uplifting and inspiring as any ive ever heard its lesson is that if youve gone through life without experiencing its tough times its tragedies and disappointments youll only be a fraction of what you could be life is about overcoming all of those thingsone of the biggest criticisms about epic songs like rush has done in the past is that they are not casually listenable i dont think any of these are that way  musically each one can stand alone even if you dont understand its place in the larger story the choruses on almost all of them deal with universal themes will it be too much for some fans or blunt the growth of their fanbase from being overly complex or intellectual i doubt iti really hope they play this entire album in concert but given that theyve only played the 20minute 2112 epic on one tour in their careers playing this 70 minute magnum opus is probably too much to hope for but damn that would be an amazing thing to experience|1
i first heard this band on a radio station that is known for playing more pop rock music rather than hard core rock lift fm the song was all around me  the lead singer for flyleaf introduced the song which i thought was pretty cool and she talked about it for i guess around thirty secondsi was impressedlistening to all her songs its great to hear hard rock music with some real meaning sometimes it seems some bands dont sing abotu anything  its just words thrown togethergreat band|1
been a rush fan for a lot of years more than i care to think about it is what i expected to hear when i downloaded it and ive been playing the entire album numerous times my favorites seven cities of gold the anarchist bu2b and caravan|1
i listed this with amazon not thinking there was a snowball change of getting a copy of it but within 3 months they notified me that they now had used cds listed i had too pay for it but think it was worth every penny|0
ive been a gnr fan for god knows how longappetite to date is still one of my favorite albums of all timeive been following whats been going on in axls band and slashs band for a while nowi liked a few songs from chinese democracy likewise for the velvet revolver stuffbut nothings got me excited about gnr in whatever incarnation until slashs solo album last yearit was kick ass classic rock n rollalso i really liked this guy id never heard of until then called myles kennedyso when i heard slash was coming out with a new album featuring kennedy as lead vocals on all the songs along with his band i was pumpedand im definitely not disappointedthe entire album rocksand there are a few truly classic songsmy favorite is anastasia which rates up there as one of the best rock songs ive heard in years imagine sweet child o mine on speedanyway cheers to slash and co for keeping it real  pardon the awful cliche but thats what this record feels like something real when theres a lot of phoniesgimmicky bands out therehighly recommended|1
another album which may seem over exposed but thats only a testament to its strength the songs are all joined together by the common thread but we already know that and if youve worn out your copy its affordable to buy a new one|1
ive been listening to ellis paul since i picked up a copy of stories which i purchased upon its release unheard and on a lark i loved his music and style immediately i was fortunate to see ellis at uncle calvins in dallas in the 90s and was even more impressed but carnival of voices is essentially my favorite ellis paul album the mixture of guitar melody and poetry really ring out every track is a joy what a great followup to his almost equally masterful say something what a wonderful singersongwriter a joy to list to|1
i listen to classic rock  the beatles rolling stones led zeppelin the doors the who david bowie cream bruce springsteen are few of the artists that i listen to but the one i have a special place for is pink floyd  i love them all but pink floyd just has amazing instrumentals great lyrics just all in all great music  when i first listened to the wall i thought it was pretty overrated but when i listened to it again i thought it was amazing  i love on the first disc empty spaces and young lust  in the flesh and thin ice are good beginnings i also love the precursor to another brick in the wall part 2 the happiest days of our lives  in my opinion that is one of the most underrated floyd songs  another brick in the wall part 3 is short and sweet  on the second disc there is the famous and incredible comfortably numb which is one of the best songs there is run like hell and the show must go on are also very good  outside the wall is a very good ending to the album  the wall makes you think in so many ways about a number  things  the person who is writing kids reviews has no idea what he is talking about  no idea  the wall along with dark side of the moon animals and wish you were here are great albums  i will treasure this|1
as a fan of goldies music and a supporter of any electronic artist who works to break the boundaries of generic convention im sad to be giving this cd a negative review i wanted it to be great and i wanted to like it i give goldie props for a great effort but its ultimately unsuccessfulthe first disc is rather staggering  an hour long drum n bass tribute to his mother the idea is great but it makes a few assumptions number 1  it assumes that approximately 30 minutes of vocal work by goldie himself is a good idea goldies vocals are barely sufficient for a track like temper temper and anything more is just inappropriate number 2  it assumes that goldies personal journey is inherently interesting the fact that he was abandoned by his mother at a young age is sad but its not enough to say i was abandoned by my mother and then make an hourlong track assuming some sort of emotional connection its a solid effort but the whole thing still seems rather selfindulgent upon listening to mother it seems like it was made more for goldies personal edification than anything else once the drums kick in things improve considerably but since its sandwiched in between long vaguely orchestral in the most diluted sense of the word arrangements its just not worth the effortthe second disc is stronger but its still no timeless goldie has already proved he can work with extended tracks because timeless was well a timeless album im not sure why he abandoned his winning formula for this album but he did temper temper is sort of rocking and is an obvious standout track dragonfly also has some nice moments unfortunately chico  death of a rockstar clearly intended to be a substantial track is just sort of bland its around 15minutes long but it cannot sustain interest it actually feels a little bit polite when it should be gritty and inyourfacei knew saturnzreturn had mixed reviews when i bought it i fully intended to find something the reviewers had missed something to make me love the album after living with the album for a while i have come to the conclusion that its just not that good im sure the very idea of a track like mother will be interesting to some for that reason i would recommend trying to find it used for a good price because its just not worth the money goldie fans would do well to skip this in favor of the superior ring of saturn while its technically a remix album all the tracks that are revisited are also improved that includes a heavily abbreviated mix of mother which works really well as a hardcore dark drum n bass trackheres the breakdown of my final rating as always i would give this 25 stars if i couldcourage factor  5 starseffort  4 starsselfindulgance  1 starexecution  2 starssuccess  1 staroverall 12 25 stars|0
brian regan has a great style that is a clean alternative for teens parents too|1
dig on this album if youre super excited about the fact that rush has given us a proper concept album 40 years into their career and are back to recording 7 minute songs but for my money all that stuff is really just  buzz thats been attached to this albums release  if the concept and songs are weak what does it really matter  the good news is  clockwork angels is another tremendous album from rush since they returned in 2002 withvapor trails  more so than that album and its morethanworthy follow up snakes  arrows clockwork angels is a sprawling ambitious challenging work of a band that has truly continued to learn how to improve their craft  impossible to fully digest after one or two listens the chunky riff rock of caravan bu2b and headlong flight will certainly have longtime fans pleased that rush is still at the top of their game but its the more subtle things about this album that really stick out in my mind as being its biggest achievementswith vapor trails and snakes  arrows rush seemed to be on an unflappable mission to simply rock as hard as they couldand they certainly delivered  as a big fan of both of those albums the one consistent critique i had was that because of this there werent a lot of dynamics to the proceedings  with clockwork angels being a concept album no real groundbreaking story to this tale of a loner yearning for a larger life but interesting nonetheless the production is very well thought out and the flow of the album is pretty much impeccable  strings keyboards and synthesizers are really put to good use fleshing out the songs and taking the lead when appropriate  its a more dynamic album than vt and sa with the group finally giving some breathing room to songs which has been missing for a while  the group references their past on songs like headlong flight bastille day and the anarchist late 70searly 80s rush with lifesons flanged guitar leads around the one minute mark yet theres a lot of new territory being explored including middleeastern flourishes the anarchist the almost remlike feel of the prechoruses to wish them well and the beautiful album closer the garden which i think even the most passionate rush hater would find hard not to praise  a critique of rush over the past ten years has often been about geddy lees vocals  that they were being doubled too often were coming off over processed and that he had run out of memorable melodies  i can respect that opinion because its somewhat valid as rush on their last couple of albums were definitely sticking to a hard rock riffheavy approach which didnt necessarily lend itself to being combined with interesting melodies  and theres still some of that on clockwork angels but at the same time this is probably their most melodic group of songs since the early 90s and they seem to have reigned in the doubling of vocals for the most part to give a more earthy natural feel to things  the garden in particular features a pretty breathtaking vocal performance from lee  im glad that there are songs like halo effect and the garden on this album as it seems that lately rush didnt want to slowquiet down for one minute  everything was very inyourface riffheavy rock  that is all still hereand in spadesbut its nice that theyve done some songs that those fans of late 80searly 90s rush have probably missed for quite some time  at the same time theres more jamming and musical interplay in these songs than in maybe any other rush album certainly more than any in the last 30 years  the opening of seven cities of gold makes you think its perhaps cyngus x1part iii  just really powerful heavy stuff before a really cool shift takes place and it transforms into a 70s bluesy hard rock song that wouldnt have been out of place with the songs they chose to cover onfeedback  as far as the musical performances go  this is rush  at this point youre not going to be disappointed in the drum guitar or bass playing  lifeson in particular is ferocious throughout and geddys bass playing is smack dab in the forefrontive been a fan of rush sinceprestoand love all of their albums for the most part except the slight fumble oftest for echo and i think the overall feeling i take away from this album is how confident and commanding rush sounds even as they step outside of their comfort zone in many respects  it really is a remarkable sign of a stillevolving creative unit|1
i love this cd i first bought it for myself then for a friend now i can not stop buying them every year somebody else on my list gets one oy vey|1
living in a box who arrived in the 80s with semihit living in a box was a fun danceable pop tune  however this is as far as it goesthe rest of this cd never arrived on radio and there is good reason why  these songs stink  none of these songs have any hit potential they are mundane run of the mill pop trashthis is the reason living in a box had one hit  if you want to buy this and take a chance like i did fine but i warned you this is a waste of moneyi was going to give this 2 stars for their one hit but why they said this was a hits compilationpuuuuuuhleasethis is just another way for a label to try to make some money on a 80s band 1 hit wonderwhat next the greatest of kajagagoogoo or maybe the the fabulous hits of michael sembello or even better the the hit stylings of andrew ridgeleygive me a break|0
love love love chickenfoot this is a great cd for rock and roll fans  looking forward to future releases by this band|1
this review is for the vinyl release and its quality not for the album itself  this record was mastered from the 1987 cd meaning that the warmth and depth normally associated with a direct analog transfer from the master tapes to vinyl is completely missing not to mention the fact that the 87 cds were mastered from 2nd and sometimes 3rd generation tapes of the master resulting in a muffled high end buried drums and too much bass  if youre looking for a vinyl copy with good sound quality youre better off hunting for one of the repressings from the 70s or 80s these are distinguished by not having a upc barcode on the back of the jacket or if you have the pocketbook a copy of the mobile fidelity sound labs vinyl release however if your sound system is lofi and youre not picky about sound quality then you wont mind the points i described above  hopefully one of these years capitolparlophoneapple will remaster the beatles catalog properly instead of letting the fans line the pockets of used record sellers|0
love this cd even back in college when i first heard it  recommend it for any family beautiful boys choir|1
different devil is chickenfoots greatest recorded song to date  michael anthony is van halens huge loss  the new vh recording will never be as good as it could have been without michael anthonys bass voice  stage presence  vh needs to humble themselves  get mike back before the vh album  tour once the chickenfoot recording  tour has run its coarse  wake up ed  al end the legend properly|1

i ordered this disc because i particularly wanted the havanaise number  i was sent a disc that had 2 paganini violin concertos on it and no havanaise and was not by violinist sarah chang  when i questioned this they could not find my amazon order number said i had given them a wrong order number which i had not  in the end they gave me a complete refund and did not ask for their mistake back  so that part ended well but i still do not have the piece of music i wantedso i will need to pursue another merchant|0

one word to describe this album incredible  stop reading these reviews now and just buy the cd lifeson lee and peart are the composers of our age it is not hyperbole to state they have given humanity the gift of thoughtful rich and inspiring music  clockwork angels is another musical achievement for rush|1
this cd is nothing to write home to mother about it contains six beatles songs two of which appear on other cds the four new songs are ok and not reflective of their talents the remaining tracks are orchestral drek by sir george martin all in all this is a poor sample of the beatles save your money the beatles have some great cds this is not one of them|0
i have been a fan of rush for 35  years it brings a sense of rightness and comfort when i listen to this album they evolve and grow musically as i grow in years rush has been is and always will be the soundtrack of my life even in the autumn of my life a child like wonder and fascination swells when i hear their musicit all comes flooding back i will tend that garden i promise|1
the beatles were pretty much over by the preceding album white album which consisted mostly of solo performances with some perfunctory overdubs  this album was their attempt to recapture their roots but they could not rekindle the innocence of bygone years  only billy prestons keyboard work redeems this otherwise slappedtogether effort  put it this way if this album had been a demo by some unknowns no record company would have touched it|0
i was just listening to the radio and comfortably numb came on  to this day i still get goosebumps everytime i hear this song  it is timeless like most of pink floyd songs  perhaps the best song ever written both musically and lyrically  i guess time will tell|1

mysterious ambitious and complex nature of clockwork angels opening with ominous synthetic keyboard effects soon lifesons acoustic guitar enters in  geddy lees vocals begin muted in effects eventually repeated to their full glory i was brought up to believethe universe has a planwe are only humanits not ours to understand incorporating the watchman a figure within the narrative with the storyline the heat further picks up within the effort  the title track is a tour de force by all means incorporating the use of various styles and sound effects  of the most interesting shifts the incorporation of a blues driven by lifesons acoustic guitar virtuosity is sheer brilliance  pearts drumming facility and lyrics are as clever and vital as ever particularly as lee delivers the refrain clockwork angels spread their arms and singsynchronized and graceful they move like living thingsgoddesses of light of sea and sky and landclockwork angels the people raise their hands as if to fly the lyrics reference spiritual and the scientific also exploring and conveying pearts atheistic beliefsthe anarchist continues to allure opening with pummeling drums and dirty sounding guitars  lees bass is noticeably present within the mix which is yet another pro of the album as a whole  continuing to help their audience understand the crux of the narrative programmatic notes are included within the jacket walking among the people  who are so content so blind  the anarchist hears the pedlars call and sneers derisively what do i lack ah vengeance definitely deep  carnies doesnt miss a beat incorporating carnival sounds at the onset to contribute to the tone poetic nature  again the lyrics in tandem with the overall production are the selling pointhalo effect is a more sensitive turn from the band though a smart and successful contrast  the program signifies loverelationships within this cut and the use of strings and tamer sound confirms this  lees lead vocals are clear as a bell  even the title references back to angels and further serves as a nuance of the tightlysewn nature of the program  seven cities of gold gives the title track a run for its money delivering perhaps the albums valedictory moment  overt from the onset driven by lees bass and the employment of angular muscular riffs seven cities of gold is nothing short of superb  the bite and the sheer resolve of the cut remind and reminisce back to2112s passage to bangkok again is it coincidence that the seven a biblical and oftcited religious number is central herethe wreckers finds more play into pearts atheistic agenda with references to salvation even if they be indirect within the program the notes read we seemed to find salvation in an unexpected signal light  steering toward it we soon learned it was false read into it as you may it is no secret that pearts lyrics have always been sharper and laden with messages deeper than what appears the wreckers shines brightly even after following a juggernaut the likes of seven cities of goldheadlong flight delivers superbly joining top echelon cuts like clockwork angels and seven cities of gold opening with a minimalistic groove and a driving uptempo nature headlong flight is rush at its best angular slick virtuosic musicianship headlong flight is classic  bu2b2 again focuses on more realist ambitions as evidenced by its program no more boundless optimism no more faith in greater powers too much pain too much grief and too much disillusion albeit brief bu2b2 is as much part of the totality of the project as anything elsewish them well incorporates asymmetric meter brilliantly and lees lungs sound as impassioned as ever  as good or possibly better is the culminating closer the garden which closes the epic well epically  standing strongly upon the program the liner state i have now arrived at that point in my own story there is a metaphorical garden in the acts and altitudes of a persons life and the treasures of that garden are love and respect  another spiritual reference nonethelesswhat else can be saidclockwork angelsis one of 2012s masterpieces  for the progrock fan dying to go back to its heydays in the 1970s this is like heaven well crafted well executed and as cerebral as any classic progrock album clockwork angels is excellent|1
i need the soundtrack fot fools rush in with matthew perry and salma hayek where do i find it|0

i actually bought this cd for those exact songsto replace a worn out cassette regrettably they arent on this cd the description and the music samples are wrongthere are at the very least two problems with the descriptionfirst what amazon calls disc 1 is really disc 2second what amazon calls disc 2 is not from this cd the description and music samples you hear are from this cdbest of germanyit looks like the description provided by the manufacturer is wrong for this cd as ive seen the same description all over the internet so if you buy this looking for specific songs youll probably be disappointedby the way  i have the cassette version ofbest of germanyand it is awesome it features heino among othersfollow up nov 19 2007well i orderedall the best from germanyto replace my worn out cassette and amazon shipped me the wrong one this cd must be discontinued it has been replaced with another that amazon shipsto get the songs listed on disc 2 you need to order this cdall time german classicsthis has taken me many weeks of ordering to track down this cd but its worth ithope this helps|0
what is there to say about the wall other than that it is one of the best albums ever  period  there is no way to encompass with words the power and impact contained in the musical genius that is  the wall it is the definitive study in how the world impacts  man  a plunge into the human condition even morsoe than dark side  of the moon  how can anyone beat tracks like  comfortably numb another brick in the wall parts  123 in the flesh run like hell  goodbye blue sky hey you etc  the creative  omniscience of the wall has remained unmatched by anything with  the exception of the beatles white album  this is the best  album i own and along with the white album would definetely be the one i  would take to a desert island with me|1
slash kills it some of his best work to date is found on this disc and myles kennedy just grows on you through repeated listenings|1
there are way to many snaps and pops on this album i am playing it on a very fine turntable with a high end cartridge i have heard that these albums have had some problems and this is another yes there is response the seller has not responsibility in this matter|0
agnetha sure know hows to sing doesnt she personally i like fridas voice better but i think her vocals for abba were fantastic and also on this album she sings very well however the songs selected for her first afterabba solo album do not interest me at all maybe its because they sound so oldfashioned and somewhat childish to me i often play abba and frida but agnethas solo work remains unplayed too bad as shes a great singer i recommend voulezvous by abba for agnethas best songs|0
refinement and elegance of her playing is pretty impressive at first hearing but this is not the kind of performance i want to come back repeatedly its matter of personal taste but for me bach should be played with much depth and sense of awe maybe im too old fashioned but whatever she plays sounds like light music and as if something is missing despite all the praises heaped upon by critics|0
the music was fine  the voices were very professional however  the music just did not fit what i was looking for and that was a more realistic sound of how it really was sung and played during the civil war|0
rush has been my favorite band for 30yrs and my favorite era is the prog 70s early 80s i am also one of those desert island list guys that actually likes great albums as a whole listen not as random songs on shuffle there were seven rush albums on that list but there are now eight cwa is a complete rush album experience that gets better with repeated listens 7 months in the songs are thoughtfully crafted to propel the theme of the story but stand on their own the story also has a lot of metaphors for the three members of rush especially neil the gtrbassdrum interplay is true power trio and alexs sound is thick on the heavy stuff and ethereal on the clean geddys bass lines are melodic and up front and his singing is the best it has ever been neil has a lot of energy and power but still intricate all that is great but we are really talking about a rush concept album that has dynamics a cinematic flow and enough odd timedrop beats carefully placed to keep you guessing it has elements and easter eggs that look back on prior phases of rush but even if you are not a hardcore rush fan cwa is an amazing complete album with ebbs and flows and is incredibly produced no track by track review but i never saw the title track and the garden coming oh yeahcwa is great on shuffle too desert island list|1
i opened the tape and noticed that there were two of the same discs  both disc 2  since i had already mailed back the duplicate which i received in error i got disgusted  i kept disc 2 and threw the other disc 2 out  i will probably not be using amazon again|0
bought this song collection for my 2 12 year old son he absolutely loves it the songs are so very catchy that i actually found myself singing along to one of the cds in the car when my son wasnt even with me|1
this is one of the most beautiful film scores ever written  the cd however is a disaster  it is poorly recorded with terrible sound  the stereo seems to be electronically processed  the original lp is infinitely superior in sound and quality although the contents are identical  if you are fortunate enough to own the original lp do not replace it with this cd  this is one case in which the cd anit worth the effort|0

i first came across the dvd under the same name hollywood rocks last year if you are a true fan of the 1980s glam and hair metal scene from los angeles then this set is definately for you the book shows rare pictues of all the different bands from that era some other books i have seen that are similar only focus on the really popular bands from that scene  poison warrant ratt ect this book shows and tells about so many more bands you may have never heard of from back then that had a strong local following but never really took off or got signed theres also a great part that shows the band flyers from back then that those guys used to pass out overall a great book for any die hard hair metal fan |1
even though im a fan of horners music this one didnt strike me at all imo the only listenable music is after the ship sinks the vocals are quite good but i dont think that shouldve give it the oscar they  probably thought since titanic had won practically everything else why not  give it best score too something that might have saved it however would  be the lack of a synthesized choir it is a good thing that dions song  only appeared once though all in all this score i repeat score for  those of you who only bought the cd for that gravy train song is pretty  much uninteresting if you buy any james horner cd make sure its willow  its kinda hard to find but can be purchased at amazon for a very  inexpensive price and believe me its worth a lot more than the money you  spend on titanic|0
dont you dare miss the ultimate dazzling recording of the famed undisputed african master of the gambian kora harp  alhaji bai kontes  legandary artistry was well documented by the press for making even some of the worlds most the most brutal dictators and hearless tyrants weep like childrenthe short amazon clips below do not begin to do it justice because they are too short to cover his astonishing transitions  take it from a conservatory graduate and full time touring professional musician get this recording and spread it around  great for background foreground and concentrated listening  there is a lot more here than the musics gleaming surface  use headphones and really concentrate on every nuance  and try to keep your foot tapping to the tempo of the initial groove no matter what you hear  and you are in for a mind altering experienceit a blessing that this vital recording was made almost didnt happen and it has been blowing my mind for over 30 years i cannot imagine life without it and it is a human tragedy that the publisher is considering discontinuing it  it is without question one of the great recordings of all timethe harmony counterpoint texture melody technique interpretationis off the charts  above all the incredible way konte appears to leave his astounding rhythmic grooves behind moving seamlessly into soaring arabesques and counter sections only to to drop back to the original groove later on right on the beat right in tempo and in exactly the right place where the groove would have been is utter genius  konte playes contrasting sections like the greatest of modern jazz drummers take a solo  but unlike them konte keeps the harmony and melody going too  if beethoven or charlie parker or rachmanainoff or earl hines or tony williams were from gambia they might sound almost as good as kontemaybe  but i never heard of those musicians making grown men cry|1
found this on vinyl used at a thrift store paid 99 cents and still feel ripped offit was in perfect playedonce condition which shows how much its owner dug iti like nancy wilson a lot but her one tune here does nothing for me pure mor schmaltz like the rest of the album even the one funkish tune sweet dreams is nowhere near what the crusaders were able to do on earlier records despite a larry carlton solo far from his best everything is overproduced polished to a fault and lacking any soul or grit that i can discerneasily the weakest crusaders album ive ever heard of about tenwith so many unheard albums out there i doubt ill ever hear this again and someone will get a used record played all of twice hope they dont pay more than 25 cents|0
flyleaf made quite an impact on the nonmainstream music industry when they made their debut with the selftitled album music journalists and critics were already marking the band as a huge future success and it isnt hard to see why while subsequent albums display the growth and evolution of the band this flyleaf exhibits a raw and unforgiving intensity that is truly mesmerising this album cemented their signature sound and introduced the world to something beautiful and unique in doing sothis rerelease is definitely worth investing in the acoustic performances are so passionate and deliver such a quiet intensity that they are able to slow your breathi believe this album to be an absolute masterpiece and i predict it will stand the test of time and uphold the standard of any future albums|1
this originally came as a three disc set 2cds and 1 interview dvd the discs come in sealed paper enevelopes that you have to rip open there is an 8 page booklet that gives some background what the group was up to and some history of the recordings it comes in a cardboard box the size of the cdsthe original version was much more expensive than this  so i dont know if it still comes with the interview dvdnote that there is also a different live cd called madison blues that features fleetwood mac in the earlier days with peter greenthe dvd is an hour and 20 minute interview of jeremy spencer from 2002 it basically covers his whole life and isnt that interesting there are a few notable insights like peter green wanted to stick to basic blues and spencer wasnt on then play onthe cds come from the fleetwood mac era of christine mcvie danny kirwan and jeremy spencerthe first cd is 72 minutes long and is a collection of studio and live tracks the first 4 tracks are studio recordings of christine mcvies band when she was a solo artist going under her maiden name christine perfect they are pretty good and might be the best thing on this whole boxset however they dont sound complete like they were not quite finished for release on a album the songs were not included on her solo albumthe next set of songs are live studio recordings of fleetwood mac when christine mcvie was not quite an official member of the band they are basically studio outtakes from kiln house there are alternative versions of tell me all the things you do and other songs the sound quality is fairly goodthe remainder of the first disc is various live performances from fleetwood mac there are some very good and interesting live tracks on the last half of this cd there is a 6 minute tell me and an 8 minute station man the sound quality is good on these live tracksthe second cd is a complete 56 minute live performance the sound quality is borderline it is not horrible like some live cds black sabbath live at last inxs live baby live simple minds city of light hawkwind early daze king crimson epitath or yes beyond and before but the sound quality is bad enough that you wouldnt want to listen to this repeatedlythe performance on the second cd has some very good sections and some not so good there is some good jamming there are some bad songs there is a section where jeremy spencer imitates elvis presley and then goes into a presley monologdanny kirwan could be a good song writer but he could also writes some horrible pop tunes purple dancer which is on both the first and second cd is probably the worst song he ever wrote on the second cd they do an 8 minute version of the song it is excrutiating getting through the singing part of the song but then the group breaks out into some of the best jamming the band has ever done|0
the dukes of dixiland  great music of course but i had barely put it on the cd player than i had to change it and only then realized that i was only getting 19 minutes of dixieland for the money since most of my cds go to 45 minutes or more i felt a bit shortchanged|0
there are some good songs on it but overall i didnt care for it i like playing cristmas cds over and over but not this one|0
i hear drums guitar bass vocals but wherere the melodiesas a huge rush fan i really wanted to like this album but after a lot of listening i have to conclude that i dont like itdont misunderstand me  i dont want to keep listening to the rush of old i dont want them to reinvent the 70s or 80s or not explore different styles growth and change are all good but great music is still great music yes i mean its supposed to transcend time and musical style and all that take these great rush albums  2112 permanent waves moving pictures gup and counterparts  they explore different styles from classic rock to progrock to synthrock to grunge but i love them all the common thread is that the music is melodious with strong hooks it does not and should not take hundreds of hours of careful listening to appreciate a rush albumindividually the guys are still rocking their respective instruments but what theyve created sounds discordant no amount of incredible technical musicianship can fix that i think geddys voice in the lower registers has really improved in the last decade but he has not made enough use of it here he sounds tired and like hes wailing when he tries those high notes most of the time his singing is not sharp enough and sounds aimlessanother point is that ive always liked pearts lyrics but unfortunately for neil theyre meant to work with the music when the music is this forgettable i really cant care about the lyrics or that this is a concept albumbesides the garden and maybe clockwork angels the other songs are really weak this is the first rush album where the ratio of good songs to filler is this low there are a couple of other songs that couldve been very good the wreckers bu2b but were spoiled due to an incoherent and rambling midsection to make them longer perhapsoverall i am sadly disappointed since when is it required to try this hard to like an album especially a rush album i hope their next one and i do hope they continue to create new music will be way better|0
laceys unforgettable  voice alone deserves a 5 star rating  shes got that rocker chick  voice that would stop any body  dead in their tracks i cant listen to this cd enough its awesome from start to finish filled with catchy beats raw emotion  and spiritual lyrics buy now even if only just to ahh and ooh at that vocal range of hers|1
i read all the 1star reviews for this cd and all i can say is how off guard they were most of them went on how it was hip to have it in high school but its nothing more than teenage music that should be forgottenor another review said that this is the roger waters show which i think is quite funny because i feel that this is pink floyds finest masterpiece this band deserves all they have anyways get this cd it may be pricy but its worth it my favorite songs are hey you run like hell young lust and much more|1
buyer beware  yes these are the usually great sometimes brilliant sometimes annoying tom lehrer songs but his introductions are gone  these are rather sterile recordings with no audience reaction and more importantly none of the wonderfully funny verbal introductions that were half the fun of tom lehrers music  the songs are there  and most while not as wonderful without the introductions do stand on their own  just know what youre getting|0
why bother if you own the studio albums and past masters beside this album could have been just 1 cd i guess if you wanted just 1 beatles to listen to in the car this might be worth it but if all the other albums this is just for super fans who have to have every beatles album in there collection|0
in this recording dr jane simington does a great job of creating a safe environment  a place conducive to complete relaxation i instantly felt at ease and allowed her to guide me through the processi definitely recommend that you use this recording to help cleanse your aura and ground your soul jane does an amazing job of guiding you through the process and after listening to them just once i can honestly say that i feel lighter already|1
no reply im a loser and what youre doing and the best of the originals on this album in that orderkansas cityhey hey hey hey rock n roll music and everybodys trying to be my baby are the best of the covers also in that orderthis album was made during a time when the beatles were exhausted and is one of the beatles worst albumshowever the album artwork on the cover is fantastic very honest and gritty|0
is not as i expected not anointed one from the lord jesus christbut in my point of view he need to do more to put his music on high level|0
i must say that i considered snakes and arrows to be a great album notwithstanding any other reviews on the site about that album i am quickly hearing and conceptualizing this album as better  as old as rush gets the more seasoned their work and more in depth the analysis must beits hard to imagine this album as a debut but every album must be considered as such  if these were 19 year old kids playing this music would people still flock to it  is it just reputation and existing achievements that make their albums so acclaimed or is there a build up of emotional attachment that makes it so  i feel it is both  they havent let down for a long time over a long travel of personal ups downs and consistencythe lyrics are top notch  the chords are in time and hard rocking with what can only be every time neals greatest  all three musicians and the mix are relevant and up to date  there is no doubt that this band listens to current music reads current literature knows current trends and makes it so in music  these are our elders preaching to us the wisdom of the ages  deny such wisdom and you may be living on your own out in the woodshas it been different in any other album they have produceddec 21 2012 find a guitar and start tuning metaphorically speaking lol|1
i dont know about any review i want to be able to listen to the song befor i rate it im not realy sure if that is the right song im thinking about if  you or some one can tell me where i can listen to the song to see if it is realy the song that i am looking for|0
terriblewhat the heck did they do to this soundtrackthe dance routine stuff is awful i just dont understand how they could take such a great piece of music and ruin itbut wellthey did i dont want visions of the fly girls dancing when i listen to simons songawful and nothing is better than the original london version and the 1973 movie version|0
it is inspirational that these men are still creating exceptional music after being together for 30 years alex at his best for sure|1
when caravan and bu2b were released last year i wasnt thoroughly blown away but starting with the title track this cd put it into overdrive and is just an unbelievably enjoyable listen  i do agree with other reviewers that it is alot to take in initially but after the third listen at least for me this is a cd you cant wait to listen to again and again it is like any concept album you really have to listen from beginning to end i also dont understand the bashing of the production value it is in no way the trainwreck vapor trails was just go and get it already and enjoy|1
ive been looking for an adult performance of peter and the wolf for quite some years  all the narrated recordings ive heard have clearly been aimed at children  besides if i want to follow the story while i listen i think i can do so reasonably well without some popular actor or rock star reading it to me  so i was pleased to see that finally someone had allowed the music to speak for itselfbut we seem to have a misunderstanding here  by adult i didnt mean humorlessi cant recall ever hearing a more wooden reading of peter and the wolf  sure most of the notes are there although the string playing in the regional orchestra up the road rather handily beats that of this st petersburg group for expression ensemble and intonation  but in spite of valiant attempts by some of the instrumental soloists to breathe a little life into the performance our timebeater stanislav gorkovenko seems grimly determined to stomp it all outif you want your peter without patter it appears that you havent many other choices  pity|0
this album is absolutely amazing roger waters is on a different level then the rest of us hes simply a genius the music lyrics and overall concept is great its a cd youll listen to over and over and over|1
and now we have the fab four coming into their own my question is if the byrds had done this album would people still be raving about it today the first song help is an ok song nice sound basically a  fun song then we have the night before which is also fun but sounds an  awful lot like another girlthen youve got to hide your love away which is  one of the best songs on the album and the only song with decent lyrics i  need you is a dreary george harrison type of thing while your going to lose  that girl sounds like 50 other beatle songs i could name ticket to ride is  the beatles trying to do the byrds but other than that its an alright song  nothing too special just a fun song act naturally is another hideous  ringo starr country and western songwhy they let him sing on any of the  albums is beyond meits only love you like me too much tell me what you  see ive just seen a face are all typical beatle songs none of them are  very interesting or the least bit memorablethen we have yesterday which is  one of the big ones its pretty but nothing special as tears go by by the  stones has much better lyrics and a lovlier tune lastly and defiantly the  least we have dizzy miss lizzy which is silly and forgettable|0
i was attracted to this album because it sounded good when listening to  the sound samples at amazoncom however in this case i was disappointed  with the actual cdthe strings are played too legato in general on the  entire cd set making the melodic line less clear and precise  the tempi  are taken quickly yet instead of sounding like an exciting performance  the whole thing just feels rushed  during the third movement of the  transcription of the bach brandenburg concerto on disc 1 there is a  section where it sounds like the disc is skipping because its hard to  follow the keyboard line but its not  its the keyboard playerthe  second disc that contains the concertos for 234 keyboards is slightly  better though theres still that extralegato string section  unfortunately this is the only recording of the bwv 1062 concerto for 3  keyboards played on the piano that i know about and its adequate though  not stellarthe recording lacks bass but otherwise sounds good for an  aad|0
i love this album but it is not even one of my top 5 favorite pink floyd albums its more of a treat when you are watching the movie as well as listening to the music from the film which is basically the same musicwhat this album needs is when the tigers broke free which is contained in the film but not on the albumthe wall is great classic fun with really good music but i tend to like the bands older predark side stuff better i love everything before dark side the best i do love dark side as well the wall is nothing like their other stuff it has its own unique sound to it i just prefer their earlier vocals so much more their old sound was much dirty raw and very psychedelicthe wall isnt my favorite by any means because it doesnt have long epic songs with awesome guitar solos and beautiful vocals the wall has interesting vocals with shorter songs telling a story which i find cool but my favorite album with a continuing story to it is tommy by the who the wall is still a great album that every floyd fan should own but they need to get out and buy their other albums as wellhearing the wall makes me want to watch the movie i still give the album 5 stars because i pretty much give every pink floyd album 5 stars they are one of my favorite bands and i love all of their stuff my least favorite though would have to be final cutalthough an awesome album i listen to it the least of all my pink floyd albums other albums you should get along with the wall are wish you were here dark side of the moon animals meddle and piper at the gates of dawn for more obscure ones get atom heart mother ummagumma more obscurred by clouds and saucerful of secrets late floyd is pretty cool toogreat band|1
rush is one of my favorite bands  this album is great and i saw this tour live  they still have it  i love the string ensembles in the songs also  really sounds great|1

im so sick of people telling me how great this album is this album is the beginning of the final stage of pf with roger waters as lead songwriter the loss of rogers father eric fletcher waters during ww2 combined with the schizophrenic tendencies of pink floyds previous songwriter syd barrett makes up the plot for the wall basicly a story of an individual who loses his father at a young age and slowly slips into very heavy mental health issues a young man named pink taken from an early pink floyd being asked which one of you is pink is a young rock star pressured by fame the death of his father and supposed schizophrenia to isolate himself from people the story of his life and tribulations is the album written entirely by roger waters and later made into a movie is one of the most sucessful pf albums of them all very boring and a definite cry for help the wall makes me fall asleep lacking the brain bending genius of dark side of the moon the wall has nothing to offer from the pf of the past besides sound fx for those of you who mistake this album for physicologic geinus rethink and realize this album is boring for pink floyd|0
great music and with this purchase i have become more of a fan than just a casual listener jp |1
from a very diverse body of work this is definitely not his best  too smooth for my liking and leaning too far to the pedestrian  some great players but they dont do much playing  well suited to smooth jazz radio so it may appeal to some listeners|0
what makes this naxos cd susceptible to being marked down is in the first instance the recorded sound which is pale and rather distant and has the effect of nullifying any enthusiasm that the musicians may have brought to the recording sessions the piano concerto is played comparatively rapidly and joseph banowetz while demonstrating his virtuoso abilities with regard to moving his fingers over the keyboard seems to me at any rate to fail to differentiate between the differing moods that the music would have been able to evoke if only he had varied his tempi somewhat a comparison with the equally lowpriced 1983 digital recording with viktoria postnikova and the vienna symphony orchestra under gennadi rozhdestvensky on decca makes it plain that this music has so much more intensity so much more color so much more in the way of variety and message than banowetzleacutenard are able to conjure uptchaikovskys tempest after shakespeare is an evocative piece that is here played acceptably by the csr symphony orchestra but again the pale somewhat cavernous sound fails to do the performance justice and the excerpts from eugen onegin just do not bear comparison with the recently rereleased version by the berlin philharmonic directed by herbert von karajan 1972 deutsche grammophon|0
in the thirties and forties it was en vogue to call a countrys top singer the bing crosby so while germany had horst winter britain had denny dennis holland had jan de vries and france jean sablon canada came up with dick todd while the europeans were fully deserving of their being compared to crosby on account of what todd was accorded these laurels is difficult to say the mere fact that he did not sing out of tune and possessed a baritone he hasnt got a very beautiful voice he has no personality no distinctive style of delivery no feeling for syncopation and he delivers the lyrics as if he were reciting a grammar book he is certainly not in the same class as some of the better singers in his time like buddy clark tony martin bob eberle dick powell let alone bing crosby no wonder that larry clinton with whose band todd made vocal noises in 19381939 made hardly any recordings with todd groaning the vocal refrain todd had a career of sorts on radio and made some recordings but his style or rather the lack of it was soon out of demand and he seems to have ended up penniless unable to come to grips with the fact that nobody liked his singing and i certainly still dont|0
computercomposed music is in its infancy but david copes emi experiments in musical intelligence is at the forefront  because the music is programmed to sound like bach chopin mozart joplin  gershwin and others copes musical pastiches are more advanced  artistically than similar efforts in computerauthored literature see  racter the policemans beard is  halfconstructedunfortunately this first disc is all programmed  on a yamaha digital piano with the result that it is fairly dry and  monochromatic  the second disc classical music composed by  computer benefits from being performed by good old humans on a  variety of instruments|0
les miserables complete symphonic recordingalthough the quality of the recording is excelent the title is misleading for those like me who were looking for purchasing only a symphonic orchestra instrumental recording without the singing part there are many other recording of the musical with a singing cast and they dont say symphonic on their title this is the part that i found misleading when i came to purchase this item and there was no information published about it on amazon that would have helped me not to purchase this item as it did not correspond to what i was looking for it is only after opening it and starting to listen to the recording that it became evident that this was not what i wanted to purchase as it duplicated other recording of the same musical which i had purchased before so be aware of this fact before you order this item|0
this is by far pink floyds best album although the final cut could have easiy been included to complete a formidable triology the wall is a masterpiece and shall not be equalled or even approached by  any band for many light years|1
my dad bought this album from amazon but i bought it from itunes  buy it here they actually get the track names rightbefore i get into the nitty gritty reasons for my rating id like to say that i grew up listening to rush  i hated them through sixth grade because my dad thought it would be a good idea to listen to them on road trips and he liked listening to the live albums  as anyone who has seen rush live knows you can really only appreciate the live stuff if youve seen it  well while i was learning guitar middle of sixth grade all of it suddenly clicked  i learned to love geddys voice and modeled my guitar playing after alexwhen i first heard snakes and arrows i despised it  far cry  wheres the guitar solo i ignored the song for a while and then i heard the entire album  it took me a good 10 listens to get but after seeing snakes and arrows live twice its among my favorite albumsclockwork angels clicked after just a few listens for me probably because i love their new sound as much as i do the first to absorb were the anarchist carnies and the garden  i had listened to headlong flight obsessively along with caravan and bu2b so i knew the tunes by heart and loved them already  the wreckers clockwork angels bu2b2 and wish them well have all grown on me after listening to it a good 10 more times  halo effect and seven cities of gold are far more challenging  halo effect bores me but seven cities has been growing on me a bitmy dad doesnt get it as much and ive found that most of the people ive forced rush onto people around age 20 love it  theyve continued to progress and i think that older fans have trouble wrapping their heads around it  ive never heard a bad thing said about the garden from either age group thoughanother reason that people seem to hate this album is geddys voice  well if you think about it hasnt that been a reservation for people since the 70s  its definitely changed with age but i dont think theres consensus about whether its a bad thing  obviously his high range has weakened  the man is 59 give him a break ive become accustomed to it  his new high range is definitely an acquired taste and im addicted to it but his lower range sounds beautiful  thats my opinion to each his own i love his voice now but im also a very open minded young person whos a big fan of the groupif youre a rush veteran thats been following them since the 70s and think they havent released a good album since grace under pressure you probably wont like this album either  if you enjoyed snakes and arrows and vapor trails you will adore this album  if you think that they should quit because geddy struggles with the high stuff from the 70s its better to be quiet and keep people in the dark about your stupidity than to open your trap and make it abundantly clear  the man is 59 and plays bass better than the majority of the young folk and a lot of us still enjoy the singingim a younger fan and ive enjoyed it  i would give it 4 stars for the lyrics the singles and the beauty of the garden alone but theres more than that to appreciate the wreckers the anarchist carnies and wish them well easily win 5 stars from me|1
i hadnt listened to this recording in years  when i did i was shocked at what a dull lifeless preformance it is it seems as if the orchestra had played this music so often that they were bored with it  were just going through the motions it plods along with no joy life or excitment i was so turned off that i studied the other available sets of the schumann symphonies  ended by ordering the levine  philadelphia and the david zinman  zurich orchestra both are quite different from each other  a huge improvement on this recording|0
this is a very sad effort if ever a song lends itself to emoting all the things you are surely does tony martin manages to produce a totally blandeven boring rendition  annoyingly he does not sing the verse either i must presume his first runthrough is sung in kerns original key and martin is unable to hit the high note  on his second runthrough there is a perfectly hideous unanticipated change of keyi mean does he have a tuningfork in his earpresumably done in order for him to finally hit when all the things you are the high note are mine  its a beautiful song and this is disappointing|0
if this was an instrumental album it would be a better jazz cd  the vocals and lyrics are a detriment herethe saxaphone playing is well done in kind of a kenny g style  which is great if you like kenny gkind of a loungey style jazz cd but not a keeper for me|0
near the end of this is spinal tap a couple of band members discuss writing a musical called saucy jack  if you ever wondered what it might sound like if an overblown heavy metal band actually wrote a broadwaytype musical you can satisfy your curiosity herelike many people i was initially drawn to this cd after hearing christmas eve sarajevo 1224 a fantastic heavy metal melding of god rest ye merry gentleman and carol of the bells  the rest of the cd has its moments but does not live up to the promise of that piece  i cant say how it compares to mannheim steamroller since i try to avoid their music whenever possible  in addition to the spinal tap styling this may be what it would sound like if andrew lloydweber wrote music to be performed by rush queen and queensryche with slash on lead guitar and with vocals by among others meatloaf neil diamond and a childrens choirthen there is the whole deal with this being a concept album  the story goes something like this  god who is apparently not as omniscient as we thought sends an angel to earth to bring back something to show that christmas is still meaningful in this day and age  isnt that similar to the plot of year without a santa claus  so the angel flies around the world listening in on christmas carols  he witnesses lands ravaged by war and other travesties but he finally finds someone who really needs his help a girl in new york who cant get home to visit her father  the angel in the guise of a little child in a seedy bar on christmas eve convinces the bartender to give money to the girl who is inexplicably standing around across the street they never say she is a hooker so that she can fly home  then the previously miserly bartender gives out free drinks to  people who are already at home in the bar  thats right the real meaning of christmas is free alcohol|0
the wall is a towering  pink floyd masterpiece from the brilliantly tormented mind of rocks literary genius roger waters david gilmour takes somewhat of a supporting role here but he shines with his trademark vocals and unbeatable guitar no one on earth plays like david gilmour mason and wright are further in the background but contribute their flavor as wellso much has been said already about the wall that i wont take up the space to rehash the plot this amazing piece of composition is like an operatic psychological rock journey through hope despair pain alienation and once again a glimmer of hope although it is very personal it also becomes universal in its treatment of themes of the loss of childhood innocence horrors of indoctrination into society familial angst and the numbing of growing into adulthood and disillusionment everything about the wall entitles it to be called a a classic|1
thanks a music fan that info was just what i was looking for much better|0
brian is the best  very kid friendly  we e this to each other all the time  i will be buying more of his work he is very talented|1
i banished this recording from my collection long ago the first movement is so stiff it sounds like it is being conducted by a metronome most cd sets will isolate the first movement on the first disc to honor the composers instructions for a pause and then follow with the remaining movements on disc two the grouping here of movements 12 and 345 shows inattentiveness from the production team avoid|0
the beatles are rock prince is pop credeance clearwater revival was  bayou tupac was rap adam sandler is comedy cake is a snake sprite is a  beverage butpink floyd is pink floyd there is no way to describe pink  floyd its the most powerful amazing music there is there is no one song  that pink floyd ever did that was bad and that rarely happens every band  has to have that one bad seedbut sorry peoplepink floyd doesnt have  one pink floyd isnt for everyone its the most unique music ever  the wall is probably theyre best but then again i cant say  that because with a best there has to be a worst and there is no one bad  album they ever did this isnt just a review for the wall  even though let me tell you it is amazing this is a review for every  pink floyd albumso when describing pink floyd there really is now way to  describe them except these two wordspink floyd and that should do it|1
dj cam is one of the best french djs but this early album of him is so flat and clumsy triphopthe ambientstyle piano dub of this album is so unexpected and unforeseenthe other hand hiphop beats and scratches are too limitedid rather recommend another album dj kicks released in k7 label than substancesthis is the worst dj cam cd ever bought|0

when they got home at night their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them within inches of their livesyeah this album is great quite possible the best album ever made it is the third bestselling album of all time in the united states behind only michael jacksons thriller reviewer has to leave momentarily so he can puke which is blasphemy in this reviewers book and the eagles greatest hits that album by the eagles is great but better then the wall i dont think so i guess the eagles album just had a broader appeal in some circles it crossed over into the country chartsi had this album since it first came out i was but a youngster in high school at the time there were many of times when id come home from a party and slip on the headphones with this cassette in the player this is a timeless album as all great art is the bottom line is this is an essential album which should be in every discriminating audiophiles collection right next to led zeppelin iv nevermind ten and blizzard of oz|1
no seacute que rayos me sucedioacute no tengo la menor idea de por queacute compreacute este cd tal vez estaban de moda pero ya no pues no he vuelto a tocar ese cd desde hace long time ago|0
given our societal crisis of confidence where authority is suspect and free will under thought control it is timely that rush returns with their intricate rich ode to individualism and personal fulfilment that they do this with the creative intensity sorely lacking in modern pop music makes the album all that much more distinct from its contemporariesas a concept album clockwork angels keeps true to its theme  a lone traveler looking for meaning in a mechanistic world a fool against the elites the individual songs provide fragmentary glimpses into his journey and encounters with diverse characters each a metaphor for the things that matter and that allow us to define our identity as distinct from the wholethere is a great deal of depth in the album  musically it proves that rock can still be born anew and poses a challenge to the rest some songs feel a bit too layered requiring repeat listening to peel away the dross to pick out the gems within|1
byther smith has recorded several gorgeous albums avaiblable on delmark and bullseye records among them housefire might be the best one  producers took their time to choose the best musicians to rehearsal several days  which is rare for blues records  and to improve the sound and the arrangement of each song so the gutwrenching singing the splendid guitar playing the terrific lyrics of byther smith could reach a level close to the best westside chicago blues ever recorded  otis rush for cobra buddy guy for vanguardlisten to the tragical live on and sing the blues the paranoiac man wants me dead the angry martha dear the desperate and funny wait and see and the instrumental knockdown could have been played by magic sam on his delmark albums the kind of stuff that goes straight to your soul and stick to it for years |1
i guess i was looking for more of a dance club with a middleastern flavorand a lot of the music started to sound the same|0
if you are looking for traditional versions of the songs in this collection do not buy this cd the versions of the songs on this collection are not by any means traditional  particularly the collection  does not include the traditional versions of the birthday song  or auld lang syne  the other songs in the collection are  mediocre at best with the possible exception of the wedding marches which  are fairly well done|0
a lot of bands new and old have attempted to bring back the feeling of 80s rock this is the first album that ive listened to in awhile that sounds like it could fit into that original genre its refreshing to get some new classic sounding metal slash has still got it|1
all i have to say about this isfunny i love this guy clean and funny everyday stuff|1
flyleaf is similar to evanesence but better and harder  this is a must buy cd  i highly recommend it|1
one does not often hear music from uganda and geoffrey oryema brings beautiful melodies topped with unusual rhythms to delight the senses|1
i have been listening to this since it came out  i liked the first cd but this one is so much better  like others said the songwriting is better  been a sammy fan for a long time  more on the solo and with chickenfoot than vh always liked dlr  cant wait for the new vh and compare i only hope its as good as this  looking forward to seeing chickenfoot when they come around here again  saw them last year and it was a killer show|1
come on you cant deny it the wall is a definite masterpiece its one of the greatest rock albums ever created 31 years and its still outstanding in almost every way who can forget another brick in the wall or comfortably numb or mother oh and we shouldnt forget the trial my favorite song on the cd that song is just brilliant beyond belief in fact almost every song here is brilliant except maybe young lust and one of my turns both of which dont really hit the right notes sometimes but hey two songs are nothing the other 24 songs whether short or long on this 2cd set are enjoyably wicked and beautiful im so glad that i encountered this at still a relatively young age its been said before but ill say it anyway they dont make them like that used to anymoregrade 9710|1
i have never heard a worse peformance of these wonderful sonatas staier has rendered his personal touches to the performance and in so doing has shown his conceits pauses in cadence and other effects make this cd impossible to listen to|0
this is a symphony and as far as that is concerned this recording is very good jrvi brings out the best of the gteborg sources and its all recorded in clear sound by the bisengineers but this symphony also includes many parts of singing and thats where my objections come the choral parts are ok but the soloists really arent i had to turn it of the first time i listened to it take a short break and then begin again from the start the vibrato and strain from just about every voice is extremely disturbing this is most surprising since youre usually spoiled with good recordings from the bislabel you ought to get another version of this fine symphony solti has made a great version for decca with just as great solosinging as conducting and bernstein though always being bernstein makes another almost as good version for dg both these are definately worth their money even if they would cost twice as much as this|0
i love frankie laine but this is not one of his best  too many are songs that were done by someone else and just arent what i had in mind  frankie did such a great job on all the hits he had so i would recommend a greatest hits etc cd instead  this just isnt one of his best|0
brian regan has to be one of the funniest men alive not only does he pick out the flaws of common man accurately but he portrays them in such a way that we all have to sit back and laugh at ourselves plus the fact that he adds in his voice distortions and face contortions makes his act one of the best this album is a must for anybody that hasnt had a good laugh in a while or anybody that simply wants to tilt their head back and give out a loud hoot once in a while a skippy magee|1
i really did not care for this cd you could not hear your arch angels talking to you at all|1
primero que nada me da gusto ver que alguien peruano como yo este ofreciendo su opinion sobre en mi criterio el mejor grupo punk que ha existido en nuestro idioma hablamos obiviamente de siniestro total pero lo mejor de siniestro fue ya hace muchos antildeos el cuando se come aqui es indiscutiblemente el mejor material de siniestro canciones como cobrador loco y te tirare del atico jamas han podido ser duplicadas o al menos se ha estado cerca de obtener ese ritmo punkeke que le rompe el craneo a cualquier persona coppini para mi fue lo mejor que le paso a siniestro lastima que solo duro para un album pero como todo lo mejor siempre hay poco yo considero el cuando se come aqui de siniestro a la altura del never mind the bollocks de pistols o la novena de beethoven obras maestras perupunkyahoocom|0

being overweight has created a feeling of disease for me and can lead to disease certainly  for 2010 im using this cd along with tinas weight management hypnotherapy cd to shed the unwanted pounds and also to replace disease with excellent health happiness and love i have used tinas cds over the years and they never get old or worn out every time i listen i am at a different place so i always get something new new revelations about myself my health is about the journey not a goal but an ongoing journey of mind body emotion and spiritual balance the cd is very soothing for anyone going through a health journey whether its cancer or anything else that poses a health challenge|1
the mechanisms used to create these tracks are truly original for television and remain a classic to music listeners of technonew age like aeon flux herself the soundtrack makes you cry wtf in a good way  i drew to this music too|1
you must avoid this title because it is the ultimate in deception as everyone knows julius larosas biggest hit is the title track of this cd but guess what the song is not on the album in its original version but a rerecorded version and nowhere is that fact stated anywhere on the cd or on the jewel case  the fact its a rerecorded version is kept hidden from you for you to know only if youre already familiar with the original hit version  the jewel case label goes so far as to actually claim it was recorded in 1953 the date of the original recording but its a lie  perhaps the vocal track is original i cant be positive but the drums and rhythm sections are definitely not original and are rerecorded  this was an expensive disappointment and total ripoff by the record label luckily you can purchase the original version of the song on any of the other titles that claim to carry this song as this rerecorded version appears only on this cd so this is the only one you really need to avoid|0
the orchestra sounds good but you can barely hear the guitar  the guitar is the reason i bought it  when you crank the volume to hear the guitar then the orchestra comes in and blasts  poor poor sound recording|0
i ordered this with overnight delivery and did not recieve it that soon it was in good condition when i did get it though|0
berwald was born a year before schubert and managed unlike that composer to make it into his 70s but any kind of serious musical recognition didnt come his way until just before his death id been familiar with the symphonies of this swedish romantic and had heard his string quartets but it was only in the last year that i chanced upon these two piano quintets both are marvelous and rendered magnificently by the vienna philharmonic quintet  the pensive middle movements of the no 2 especially appeal to me this is wonderful music at a bargain price that is it will be if you can find it at the time i write this its not available through amazon arkiv music however does have copies available you should grab one|1
i bought this cd because it featured john harrison i love his part of the cd but the rest was really boring if you like john harrison pick up his soundtrack from day of the dead 1985 really cool keyboard stuff|0
this is a simple no music cd i have fallen asleep many times listening i only gave it 4 stars because she repeats certain phrases to many times|1
welcome back to the 80sto the mediocre parts of the 80s  im afraid that this group really only had one good hit  the rest of the music is unmoving  heavy with synthesizers dry melodies and passionless vocals all i can really say is skip it|0
the wall its a classic album and but i dont believe its pink floyd at their best if any other band in the world released an album like this it would be really great but pink floyd can do so much better sure there are great songs like mother another brick in the wall pt2 hey you etc and my vote for the best song of alltime comfortably numb but that being said there are too many stupid filler songs its the only pink floyd album that i cant listen to from start to finish its not that its depressing i listen to sentenced try listening to sentenced and tell me if this album is depressing no i like slow sad music its just that the album has alot of parts that are very unneccasary well thats enough of my ranting dont take it from me listen to it for yourself all im saying is i believe albums like wish you were here and animals are better floyd pieces than this one|1
ive always loved hamlisch and hated sayger faker baker my god what a horrible dated terrible lyrics and rotten scoring i feel like taking a shower now that ive listened to it not 1 memorable song and its amazing that chorus line which is 5 years before is as fresh brilliant and innovative as ever and this piece of garbage started out dated|0
chicken foot is a must have for any guitar blues fan it has incredible guitar solos and vocals by hagarill definatly buy more|1

great vocals checkamazing guitar checkbass drums wellcrafted rock songs check check and checkgreat album great talent great great band how many greats is that i dont know but however many isnt enough get this album|1
there is nothing on this album that you havent heard already in 80s pop david bowie 80s springsteen even outfield the entire album feels canned prefabricated and overproduced which would be fine had another 80s outfit recorded it unfortunately a rich legacy including amazing albums such as dsotm wywh and animals is here abandoned with the exit of roger waters david gilmour is the only floyd member who plays on all the tracks mason and wright do minor work and he forsakes his guitar far too much in order to add canned synthesizers and cheap effects he also writes most of the lyrics which are flat and uninteresting after hearing waters lyrics a new machine part 1 terminal frost and a new machine part 2 is the worst block of floyd music to dateim not being a floyd nerd but this album as a pink floyd recording fails miserably it is badly dated and devoid of the psychedelic flavor featured on nearly every other floyd album and lacks the classic rock riffs and ballads that the wall and the final cut deliveryet there are a few saving graces of this album the organ part towards the middle of the instrumental signs of life sounds like a throwback to iron butterflyera rock but the 80s flavor is still undeniable gilmour has a few interesting solos throughout the album and on the turning away is a good song not a great song if the boys had just laid off the cheesy effects in this song it would have been a great more simple ballad that rivaled the terrific song wish you were hereall in all if you need to complete your collection get this album but if you love the david gilmour of darkside and wywh you will be sorely disappointed by this effort but if you are a fan of cheesy 80s rock go for it this is a novelty|0
the beatles were probably the best white pop band of the sixties and there are great songs here but there is just way too much crap  lennon is responsible for most of the useless songs here  this could have been a great single album|0
i heard this on the radio three years before i was able to find iti did not know who did the music now i play it even when it is not the christmas season|1
this is an abominable recording and i dont recommend that anyone waste a cent on it  one voice per part is an interesting idea in theory but the reality of this recording is awful  the whole idea of small chorus is to improve resolution of the details but rifkin throws that away by having the instruments so loud they obscure the chorus  even within the orchestra the balance is horrible at times the dominant sound is the organ doing nobrainer harmonic fill you get a lot more choral detail with richter or various other of the best conventional performancesto cap it off the quality of the voices  except for the excellent bass jan opalach  is substandard  in 80 for example the solo tenor phrase tritt freudig and den krieg  march joyfully to the battle comes across as if he were singing mince vaguely over to the buffet table  contrast this with aldo baldins intense and deeply felt performance with leppardi would like to hear a great one voice per part performance of 80  but this is not it|0
i was laughing hard throughout  im not surprised at all the five stars it receives|1
this is just simply a great folk album  there are stronger songs but each is rewarding in its own way and the album unfolds as a whole into a tremendous work of art  i must listen to this cd once a week even after owning it for years if you are into singersongwriters ellis might be the one you are overlooking if you are familiar with john gorka david wilcox etc ellis paul is much more rewarding he is also fantastic in concert and he is still relatively unknown enough to see him in most venues with around 150 people|1
started listening to raffi in the late 80s with my first child  just as fresh 25 years later|1
this should never have been madei wish i hadnt watched it  nothing worked at alleven dear richard couldnt save this production|0
i am on a 3rd listen the keyboards are back well sort of they have added some piano last song and some keyboards in places which really add a lot to the sound this may be the best album since hemispheres i have them all i thought the mix on vapor trails was bad too much treble snakes was much better but only the first half of the album was great with a few boring tunes near the end with the exception of the filler bu2b2 i like all the other songs on clockwork musically this may be their best album alex uses a variety of guitar tones that sounds like the 80s and 70s at times with chorus and reverb and some clean electric tones think time stand still neil continues his angry diatribe against god the watchmaker here and this can all be traced back to his personal tragedies there were a few songs about this on the last half of snakes faithless in clockwork he lets loose and dedicates a whole album to the theme as he battles trying to explain an evil world and why bad things happen to good people he even takes a swipe at a verse in proverbs in the old testament in the title track once you get past that this is a great album hopefully neil has finally gotten this out of his system now and can move on to other topics in the next album great album|1
i had this music for my children 25 years ago and now i have it for my granddaughter and she loves it as much as they did|1
the hossam ramzy track 1 is very good  the rest are like pop versions of belly dance music smileyface versions some are almost the type of song you expect to find on a childrens educational program  one cut even had happy hand clappingi am not a belly dancer i was looking for music evocative of that genre and this is not it|0

this cool collection of 999 songs is lacking the earlier spunk and power of the original recordings  why make a really good collection of 999 songs and not put the original recordings  recording is smoother and better  sound but since when does punk need that  raw energy of earlier  recordings far out shine these redone classic 999 songs|0
i bought this album on cd when it was first released i compaired notes with a copy of this album on lp amd ross jr ruined this classic album  the songs the devil went down to georgia and boot scootin boogie should have been on the low places cd he totally ruined i love a rainy night by putting dialog all over the songfor those that want the classic album can look for it on line the original lp had brenda lee singing made for each other with alvin as well as back to the basices of love please ross stop ruining the oruginal lpssorry alvin you srruck out with this reissue bagdasarian made a mess of this one|0
my experience with the product received is very good this is a cd you can not buy it in my country of residence if i can either listen to or download from various internet sites interested i have the original disk i do not speak english so im using an online translator to send my comments and i hope it does not change the essence or what i mean|1
i was a little dissapointed im a musician and it was mostly just music i really like merlins magic for putting you in a good zone this was just okay for me nothing in comparison to merlins magic and deuter cant say as it got to anyside of my brain lol i reallly wanted to hear something different and this didnt do it for me|0
pink floyds final true album with bassistlead songwriter roger waters the wall is on a peak above any other concept album written prior or post cheifly penned and composed by waters the wall intends and delivers on providing a conceptual groundwork as a sort of map for the music the story of a rock musician aptly named pinks slow descent into insanity citing various bricks his mother education absence of paternal presence which are combined to form a wall for pink a seperation from society and cultured life the second half of the album focuses on pinks follies with drugs beginning with selfhatred and loathing hallucinations about his father and the war and being drugged up in order to perform a concert hallucinating wildly pink imagines himself a fascist dictatior cynically delivering the next three songs finally when all hope nearly fails pink commits to putting himself on trial for his social crimes this story while i may be reiterating it for the upteenth time remains one of my favourite aspects of the album and is essential to truly appreciating the musicthe primary consideration of course is the music itself floyd are able to create intense textures as well as maniaclly pounding rock songs several tracks are short and are meant as segues into subseqent songs standout rock compositions include but are by no means limited to comfortably numb run like hell young lust and the wildly progressive one of my turns other more ambient pieces are epic in their own right and allow for gilmours guitar work to stand out in a way that it hasnt since the classic wish you were here albumthe wall is an album that has been and will be enjoyed for generations and possesses a demanding longevity that will not be ignored you should buy it if you have not already after all it is 23 times platinum favourite songs comfortably numb another brick in the wall pt1 run like hell waiting for the worms the trial5 stars|1
dont know what happened after southpaw but this album is worse both in style and production but it only if you need to complete your collection|0
enough said rush still keeps on rocking  the garden and the wreckers are some of my favorite songs would recommend it to any true rush fan out there|1
this is one of the few rock concept albums that truly works as a concept album  it tells a cohesive and intelligent story which sets it above the whos tommy which has great music but a poor storyline who  fans are screaming right now but the false messiah story is old hat and  some of tommy is a series of undeveloped characters showing up  to abuse him then leave the story  and even though i am a huge kinks fan  and i like many of the kinks concept albums not one tells a story as  powerfully as the wall which allows us to explore a rock  stars psyche from the child whose father dies in wwii through marital  problems and drug abuse through madness imagines himself as a hitlerlike  dictator until finally he tears down the wall that he has mentally built  between him and the rest of the world  for those who dont know the  wall is a combined biography of syd barrett and roger waters at  different times the leaders of pink floyd|1
one of the best albums of all time right up there with the beatles white album rolling stones let it bleed and jimi hendrix electric ladyland|1
agnetha sure know hows to sing doesnt she personally i like fridas voice better but i think her vocals for abba were fantastic and also on this album she sings very well however the songs selected for her first  afterabba solo album do not interest me at all maybe its because they  sound so oldfashioned to me i often play abba and frida but agnethas  solo work remains unplayed too bad as shes a great singer i recommend  voulezvous by abba for agnethas best songs|0
yes ive read the comments made by those that felt obligated to give it one star and found that most of them were made without actually listening to the album hearing it maybe but not listening as far as those that  couldnt follow the story of the album im sorry go buy some yanni  now dont get me wrong there were some well founded notations almost the  only thing that anyone brought up that made any sense was that they liked  earlier floyd and felt that this wasnt as good or that it was a roger  waters album well why not try to review it on its own merrit and stop  worrying who wrote most of it or if its a replica of atom heart mother  anyway i found this album to be incredible and would suggest it to  anyone listen to it a few times all the way through and youll realize the  power that it holds defeniatly my favorite album  ps it has  sold 23 million copies to date|1
the cds are mislabeled  it is a 3cd set and two of them say cd 2 and the third says cd 3  im sure this is not the vendors fault but the manufacturers fault however the vendor should have examined the product before selling it and they would have noticed the problem too  i havent listened to it yet and i sincerely hope at least that the right music is on the cds otherwise it will be a useless purchase without act 1 of the opera|0
so does the cd contain music with lyrics or an actual score cause if its one with lyrics and not the actual score it will save me the trouble getting it and spending money on something i wont be happy with|0
im an avid fan of all of pink floyds albums  but i can honestly say that i cannot stand this oneyes the music is nice  it is a nice piece of work and i certinaly cant deny that roger was a fantastic songwriter and musician  but it is quite literally a solo piece of work by roger with the rest of the members from pink floyd being backing instruments mainly and i think that is an insult to the pink floyd namepink floyd are a band they are suppoed to write together or as much together as they can stand of each other play together sing together and whatnot if roger waters wanted to produce a solo piece of music on his own then that would have been fine but to do it under the pink floyd name i do believe it is an insult if the whole of pink floyd were more engaged in the album and the four members had been in the band then it wouldnt be half as badthis album was also certinaly different from the others with the opening lines being jesus jesus whats it all about its just not pink floyd at all and a whole album based on the warclassic examples of pink floyds greatest songs would be animals and dark side of the moon  i wouldnt recommend this one to a new curious pink floydian|0
ive looked at this soundtrack ever since the movie was released and never bought it because i just cant believe the nice soothing choir tracks from kevins scenes near and inside the church were missing from the track lists that i saw advertised they can be found on a john williams disc called joy to the world also remarkably missing are the old classic rock christmas tunes like rockin around the christmas tree brenda lee and the drifters version of white christmas a good alternative buy for a soulful mix of christmas tunes is the soundtrack to mixed nuts which includes the drifters track the remaining pop tracks here more or less just make me nervous for christmas which is definitely not what i want to be i hope this helps|0
the songs just did not get me dancing  i have to say i was disappointed  but i love kids favorite songs vol 2 but was never able to buy it as it was not available|0
with the death of morphines mark sandman treat her right seems to be the next band to take the drunken throne of laid back southern drunked bar blues  amazing music an awesome combination of good lyrics great  swinging music and an overall aura of relaxation  definately  recommend this album|1
i heard this at a lesbian discotheque in berlin  it made me gag that i was even there i was getting out of a bad blizzard and i nearly puked because these songs were so badabba singer annifrid lyngstad aka frida dumb name does the job of messing up this album  theres nothing noteworthy or even interesting  its swedish slop served up in 80s decorif you stuck your hand in a bin of 70s era gay discotheque music youd have a better chance of finding something at least passablei know theres something going on is supposed to be the great song here but its so horribly annoying as to produce a monotone buzzing in your ear|0
none of pink floyds albums really justify the hype and this one is no exception individually the song the wall is appealing but there isnt much else that really creates a desire to play this repeatedly  that said its definitely better than the tremendously overhyped dark side  of the moon but still doesnt stand up to the achievements of the better  artists of that era if you are looking to build your collection better to  go for the rolling stones led zep or fleetwood mac|0
unhappily i disagree the conducting and playing are appallingly sloppy given that this is a studio recording not a live performance recorded frequently the soloists are ahead of the orchestra and the chorus exists in its own space warp the ssoloists yes are wonderful but they do not displace and in fact hardly compete with the lineup of gedda christoff and de los angeles i was shocked at the inaccuracies of the ensemble work and the muddy acoustic swallows many instrumental and choral lines that are perfectly coherent and balanced in the much earlier angel recording from 1959 likewise and french conductor and orchestra and a russian mephistopheles how far standards fell merely 20 years later the editions of the opera in both sets are not quite the same a couple of scenese are cut from the beginning of act iv but the overall clarity and french lilt of the earlier angel set make it in my opinion demonstrably superior with respect to sheer correct musicianship|0
i have been a rush fan since 1976 i was 12 years old and my older brother came home with the live all the worlds a stage double lp around 1987 i drifted to other artists for a very short time as favorites somewhat bemused by the direction that much of hold your fire and the more synth laden sound had developed into  then swiftly with the presto album and first hearing the song show dont tell on the our local radio station my opinion and my heartfelt passion for rush was then refreshed and renewed i can say today that i have enjoyed every aspect of rushs long career of musical diversity and musicianship sure certainly scratched my head in confusion along the way  but rush is the most consistent rock band prog or other ever everwith snakes  arrows and the tour that followed i was thrilled by how great they had continued to be live in concert i first saw them in 1979again being appeteased by the new songs caravan and bu2b something i didnt really feel or recall them doing since putting subdivisions into their moving pictures tour set list before signals came out please correct me if im wrong about that ahhh radio the great long lost and greatly confused and misused media outlet it has sorely dismissed some of the amazing 1980s rush singles distant early warning time stands still big money etc i feel that radio once much of the radio stations were bought up by big money corporations such sociopolitcal statements had to be curtailed by previously lauded works placing rush and so many other bands that continue to put out new music to the category of classic rock they are classic butanyway i know you know what im talking abouti felt with the snakes  arrows albeit a fine fine work they needed to next make a really powerful complete rush album tighten up the loose ends jams and instrumentals and make a solid reflective though modern sonic record front to back completei feel with clockwork angels it is donethey have created a work that at this stage of the trios career is a true masterwork that will hold up and be considered one of their best and most cohesivewith 20 albums endless tours and life journey distractions from tragedy to success personally and professionally they still make incredibly poignant and groundbreaking musicthis might possibly be the best rush album of songs a single body of work an album per se of a combination of longer pieces and shorter songs with no wasted space they are on fire and on the mark on every track i like that caravan opens the record it is stunning and desperately deserves to be on the radio everyday everywhere same with the garden  the wreckers headlong flight they are outstanding performancesby the time you the listener gets to the song the anarchist your head is spinning at power thrust each song has a development of  the featured story but doesnt overkill the point and ruin any kind of individual statement made by each song on its own terms it is a work of brilliant genius and the musicianship is on every level simply fantastic the music taps into impressions made from each stage of rushs catalog neils drumming is as always a beyond impression of elegance intensity and intelligent execution he is simplly the best rock drummer of the past 30 years geddy lees unimaginable abiliy to sing while covering many bases and triggers is a focused precision in the same mindset alex lifeson is in my opinion one of the most though very highly rated underrated guitarists his nuances are within the songs and never in the way of the complete messagei really enjoy where geddys voice has developed and grown emotional harmonic melodic and completely a singing vocali trust rush i trust them to make intelligent musical decisions and i dont question their creative voices and processthey are painters each with individual brush strokes creating works of art when they work truly together in unity as the friends that they are deeply respectful of each others minds and instincts and never compromising the fact that they are indeed a rock band in my obvious and not unbiased personal opinion a great great band of originality and pride in the music that they make the lives that they live and the influence that they have on their fans lives good work|1
i own and love this album precisely because it is not played on mtv our culture is doomed|1
i was excited to put this in my cd player being that i love waterfalls so much  i was very disappointed when i heard it play  it sounds like the static white noise you hear when a tv station goes off the air|0
this is an excellent rush record it definitely gets a lot of playing time in my house i wont spoil the contents but suffice it to say it is a concept album and a really good one at that|1
the white album is quite possibly the most overrated alum in history followed closely by the beatles sgt peppers  the beatles poor musicians rely heavily upon studio technology to polish  their work  one could argue that producer george martin is far more  valuable then talentless drummer ringo starr  the beatles never really  toured after their early days and there was no edge to their music  they  only could write bubble gum pop songs like the hideous rocky  racoon  on the other hand the stones would never write such drivel  their classic exile on main st not only eclipses every beatle  album ever made but every album ever made period  i am willing to  challenge every beatle fan on this one  i will go as far to say that the  stones emotional rescue is better then abbey road|0
as a huge fan of alter bridge i was slightly skeptical of how this album would turn out  i was stuck wondering whether it would sound too much like alter bridge or too much like guns and roses  luckily i surprised when i heard a perfect medium between the two  myles has a voice that tells a story  one of excitement youth pain life etc slash has guitar playing skills that also tell a similar story  put those two together along with some pretty awesome lyrics and you have yourself an awesome rock album  if i could go back in time to the early 90s this album would fit right in with the rest of the rock greats of that era  it almost makes me wish i had a tape cassette player and cassette version of the album  very nostalgic  well done myles and slash  well donesongs to listen tofar and awaynot for meone last thrillyoure a lieanastasiabad rainupdatei have had this album for over three months now and it is still played once a day while at work  far and away has easily become my favorite song on the album  myles kennedy belts out the lyrics beautifully and is backed by an unbelievable guitarist  i recently saw them perform this album at the welmont theatre in new york  good lord was it awesome these guys are having fun and they make sure to give back to their fans by putting on an amazing show  you need to own this cdalbum|1
like this pairs other albums they have some good choices that i have heard of but never heard before |1
this vinyl reissue is awful its like listening to the beatles around a campfire with all the noise in the background and in between tracks|0
i liked this album right off the  bat but the more i listen the better it gets  i actually think it may be better than chinese democracy though that could be due to this being newhowever you cut it with this and chinese democracy being so solid it appears that finally the boys in gnr have gone on to bigger and better|1
this is a great cd i love it and everybody i know loves it great for gifts i and my friends only wish that brian regan had done more cds like this|1
four virtuosos just out making music for fun they have so much fun making classic rock that you cant help have a good time too|1
the movie this soundtrack is from is possibly a work of genius and i really do not use that word lightly but at the same time i dislike it the walls imagery is a creepy mindtrip unlike everythingumever made yeahi disliked it because it disturbed me and made me feel ill which is unusual because im a dark sort of person but it certainly was worth seeing once just because even though i didnt like it i was amazed by it and couldnt stop watching until it was over similar to a fascination with staring at a rotting corpse you are disgusted by but cannot take your eyes off ofbut wait were talking only about the soundtrack here not the movie its fromthere are quite a lot of tracks on this classic cd which range from unique but annoying only 2 tracks to wonderful most of the rest to aweinspiring phenomenal music that will be permanently emblazon itself in your mind something like 5 of themthis music gives you a feeling you cant experience with any other music its that unique and perhaps one could say mind expandingbut if you are unable to understand it you will not be able to enjoy it like classical musicthis really is classic rock and its far more fresh and vibrant than the modern pop music of today|1
how do you market a thirdrate barmitzvah band playing simplistic bubblegum eurotrash with cheesy keyboard generated horns and a drum machine  but wait are they not singing in portuguese the official language of brazil the land of sensuous infectious brilliant music by prodigies like jobim buarque veloso gilberto nascimento lins call the band the name of a chic en vogue party town in brazil and call the cd brazil is for lovers and if that does not work rerelease under musical tour of brazil am i being too harsh|0
the cd didnt have the song i neededbecareful what u get i think it was ok be lookn again|0
i listened to raffi on a record player as a kid and went to one of his concerts simple cute songs that are great for little ones now my daughter can enjoy these songs too|1
okay so i know its a harmonium but jeez is that instrument tough on the ears  nusrats vocals are powerful and inspiring the tabla sets a nice beat but the harmonium ruins the show  a little harmonium ok but not the whole cd  what you get is nusrat drowned out by the extremely annoying offbeat wailing choppy drone of that awful harmonium if it wasnt for the passion that nusrat brings to the recording this cd would be no better than one star  if it wasnt for the grating harmonium shabaaz would be a four star effort for nusrats inspiring vocals with a more soothing backdrop try the prayer cycle  or buy shabaaz and groove to the agitating vibration of the harmonium|0
to prove rushs musicianship in the sense that they can sound just as amazing using second rate equipment raskulinecz insisted that for this new ablum lifeson use a 2002 fender squier bullet and 2007 daisy rock 34 scale guitar which he had purchased for his daughters 8th birthday from walmart no less lee was limited to a 1998 rogue bass guitar with an alder body and black on chrome hardware in speaking of the daisy rock lifeson said so he speaking of raskulineczhanded me this pink glittery stringy piece of sht thing to play that i guess had belonged to his daughter or something at first i was like wft raskulinecz get this gd dmn thing out of my face i mean even the smell of the substandard woods was causing me to nauseate but raskulinecz being the pro that he is said  look al if you can record the entire album on this thing i promise you it will be the best work you have ever done in your entire life  yes you will have to work twice as hard to get what you want out this shitar that is what he called it but the extra work will show in the music well dammit he was right i mean i had quadruple triple effect racks hooked up to this halfdonkeyassed guitar when i recorded the solo for the garden and that may be quite possible the best solo i have ever tracked to date its like the strings were so fricken hard to bend and the strenuous effort really comes through on that song lee on the other hand had his own problems with the rogue bass the d string machine head had stripped completely out of its bolt hole and kept popping the string out and catching lee on the side of the face leaving a pompourous welt at one point during the recording of the anarchist  about two minutes in to be exact the string snapped yet again lee grabbed the string and charged raskulinecz lifeson stepped in and calmed lee down peart offered lee some of his gorilla glue and well the rest is history as for using the daisy rock live lifeson said i would rather cut raskulinecz wrists and then stitch them back up so i can cut them yet again|1
bought this cd for the brother for his birthdayhe couldnt be happier the songs are fantastic rush is awesome buy this cd  you will not be sorry|1
highlights are never worth it  you will never get the little inbetween songs which make a show complete montages will be cut together badly instead of being full songs as they should beso much is left out  this is a fantastic show and deserves to be heard in full|0

could a magnetic shift much like the one theorized to send the dinosaurs into extinction be around the corner resonance earth is overdue is a fictionalized doomsday scenario that follows dr jordan abellard and dr jillian brookwood with few believing their claims they are faced with the task of finding some way to save the human race from the same fate as their distant reptilian cousins resonance earth is overdue is an action packed thriller highly recommended for community library collections|1
i bought this item for my husband for his birthday although it arrived after his birthday the later date in the arrival estimate so technically not late he absolutely loved it he is very particular of his vinyl collection ie he checks the corners for dents etc and he even said it was in perfect condition awesome item|1
missing songs are frog kissin the one i wanted fiddlin around poison love and ill see you in my dreams  only 27 minutes of music  beware|0
could not figure out why it was chickenfoot iii as i couldnt ever remember a ii  then i opened up the package and saw the 3d anaglyphs  outstanding packaging  makes me want to buy one more just to archive  i put the music on and ive been playing this cd over and over and over  great mix of rockers and even a ballad  what surprised me was the raw sound of three and a half letter in which sammy screams i need a job im willing to work but i need a job  if that doesnt sum up this obamanation economy i dont know what does  loving different devil bigfoot and dubai blues  this is a very fun cd in both sight and sound  buy it|1
what a stellar cast when you look at the prestigous names here the first thought is wow what a performance i bet that is unfortunetly despite rock solid singingthe whole affair is about as uninspired and boring as any parsifal i have ever heardand i have heard quite a fewfirst of all let me state that i do not like placido domingo in wagner repertoire with the possible exception of his tristan which is still too italiante wagner late opus  nurtured the masculine german sound which domingo lacks or purposely avoidsthe singing actually isnt as good as the names suggest kurt moll sounds strained norman is good and james morris is beautiful the real problem which i am sorry to say since i am a fan of his is levines tempos they are almost unbearable in their lack of momemtum i adore the met and i adore levine but this cd and his dvd traversal of this specific opera are both failures though the dvd is much better due to the added excitementif it can be called that being in front of a live audience siegrfried jerusalem is parsifal in the dvd and hits the overall role much more on the head despite some pretty gruesome acting if you want to hear a good modern version of this operago to barenboim which  so much better than it is almost laughable barenboim along with karajan and knappertbuschmy personal favourite are the way to goavoid this like the plague unless you want boring sluggish uninspired wagner for dvd versions check out horst steins with bayreuth|0
the music is good but it looks like he recorded it from another and sent it to me it was in a white sleeve wasnt even it the original case it sounds good but i think i deserve a better product for the money|0
this mildly entertaining musical black comedy about a mommas boy serial killer and the mommas boy cop who tracks him down is definitely unique in its choice of subject unfortunately the jewish mother and murder jokes wear thin quite quicklydespite a topnotch cast the music all sounds the same melodies and lyrics while pleasant are rather pedantic and simple no complex sondheimesque harmonies or witty word plays here|0
initially the cds played well and beautifully but then they stopped for some inexplicable reason  will i be able to get a refund or a replacement  thanks for your consideration|0
brian regan is hilarious he can entertain anyone with his act  hes even able to pull off a recorded show that cant be seen  though ive never seen him i bet hes even funnier livehis style is a mix of seinfeld and a bit of insanity but the two together are great|1
this cd features anthony arizaga playing christmas songs on flamenco guitar  that is it in its entirety  there are no vocals and no instruments other than the flamenco guitar  arizaga is obviously a great guitarist but its pretty boring listening to somebody play flamenco guitar for 48 minutes to me anyway  not much variety to it at all  the best track here is the do you hear what i hearlittle drummer boy medley  i almost put it on a compilation cd i made for a friend of mine recently but i cut it at the last minute due to time restraints  here is the complete track listing for this cd1 god rest ye merry gentlemenwe three kings2 have yourself a merry little christmas3 it came upon a midnight clear4 the christmas song5 oh holy night6 the first noel7 ill be home for christmas8 joy to the world9 white christmas10 oh little town of bethlehem11 what child is this12 silent nightaway in a manger13 do you hear what i hearlittle drummer boy|0

we play this in the car all the time our 2yr old loves the music he is now singing because of this cdi recommend this to everyone|1
to put plainly this brass section very old agewise and do not have chops that they did 20 30 or 40 years ago  their old lips just cant do it  its painful to hear adolph herseth try and play this insane trumpet part at 70 years old  he just doesnt have it anymore  and hes not the only one  jay friedman is starting to decay and sounds really bad in all places not just the loud parts  same with herseth  he uses this nasty vibrato to try cover up his bad tone  the only good part of this recording it charles vernon but barenboim holds him back  when i first saw this recording i wanted to get it too  i said hey the greatest brass section ever playing the alpine symphony  unfortunately i was sorely disappointed and you will to if you buy this  i have an la phil recording but im not sure when it was recorded or who conducted it but it is flat out amazing they can handle this monster  unfortunately chicago cant|0

this soundtrack is simply horrible if you are a fan of country music youll be disappointed if you are a fan of broadway musicals youll be disappointed if you are a fan of live plays with good scripts youll be disappointedits classic country mixed with showtunes to top it all off its all done with the quality of a mediocre bar band the vocals are boring and mediocre the ladies sound better than the men the men simply sound boringeven lousyin my opinion there isnt really any impressive musicianship the basslines are boring and stereotypical the drumming is solid enough but nothing interesting the guitar playing is generic the piano playing is fair but not attention grabbingi bought this soundtrack to learn the songs because i was going to play bass in the show even though i accepted the gig to play the show i still think the entire soundtrack stinks unless you need to hear this to learn to perform the songs save yoru money for simple listening enjoyment this recording is just not worth any attention i honestly think this show came to be because the band was probably going nowhere and was looking for a way to get their faces out there it might have worked back in 1982 but today the music just isnt up to the level it could be|0
i am not an anti sailor moon person if that is what you are thinking but this cd has the music potential as a barney movie soundtrack i have seen both english and japanese versions of sailor moon and i must say the if you  buy this cd you are supporting the person who decided to chop up a  wonderful anime into a peice of crud|0
the initial reason i purchased this cd was because the only version i had was a cassette tape and nothing that worked to play it onin this has been listening pleasure for me for years now especially for later in the afternoon when i can make some quiet time for myself anyone out there who is feeling the frazzle of todays modern world should appreciate ascension its good to have it back as part of my collection|1

i cant believe this is still around this set on the bescol label is the poster child for what not to do when you release beautiful old recordings it is terrible from beginning to end do yourself a favor and do not waste your money and time on the bescol setthe recordings themselves actually sounded very good when they were made and they are wonderful performances look around and you can find these same recordings in much better presentations than this bescol travesty|0
to be quite honest id rather hear something more positive and uplifting however being a poet myself i realy appreciate the honesty and the deepness of roger waters lyrics this was my first pink floyd purchase and it definitely shocked me most artists now cant even go a song without straying from their topic or message waters goes 2 full discs on 1 plot that takes a lot of skill and talent he wasnt afraid to throw himself out there and let his opinions and thoughts out for the world to see breaking down the wall he built to seperate himself from others knowing everyone would analyze and pick apart his lyrics he did it anyway musically it can go from slow paced to fast paced in a matter of seconds without losing its listener id say the majority of the album is very relaxed though complemented by the vocals which go with the music perfectly dont get me wrong i dont like every song on this album but i like enough of them for me to enjoy it and appreciate the genius of it and waters lyrics i havent heard another pink floyd album yet but i urge everyone to give the wall a listen and a 2nd to realy understand the concept of it if youre more into a positive message like myself check it out anyway for the story and if youre a poet or a writer you should appreciate the work and thoughts put into these well written lyrics|1

first off  im canadian eh  rush are considered in canadian music circles as royalty  rightfully so   to the best of my knowledge   again  this is purely just my humble review  with all the fantastic music which rush put out over the decades  this release just sucks big dead bunnies  seriously  i was really thrilled to see new music from rush  huge huge huge fan  but  at  the same time im not going praise a release from a band based on fanship   im going to base it on what i think is the actually quality of the music   i just find this cd crap  the songs sound tired  geddy just doesnt sound strong  solid like he did in the past  the whole message of the cd  i just dont get it  cant find it  frankly  gave this thing away to a complete stranger whom commented on my geddy tshirt  told me he was a huge rush fan  afterwards  i asked him what he thought  even he came back with a meh  its just ok comment  so  apparently its just not me |0
this is the worst opera recording i have ever heard  it reminds me of the old bootleg albums made in the 60s and 70s on lowquality recording equipment smuggled into venues where it was illegally recorded  there is distortion whenever one of the featured sopranosespecially sutherlandenters the high register and the hissing background sound that persists throughout the recording is utterly distracting  i will be donating this recording to my local used bookstore    or perhaps i will throw it away so some other unsuspecting customer doesnt pay good money for it|0
i had a copy of this cd collection for several years and lost it this summer 2012 so the one i have now is a replacement which means i am very familiar with it  i like it not only for the songs but the entire collection is narrated so there is a lot of civil war history woven in every time i take an extended road trip in my car i take it with me and listen to it at least once i would highly recommend this to anyone interested in civil war history|1

if you love hawaiian music then youll hate this cd please dont buy this cd if you in any way shape or form like hawaiian music when you open up the cd jewel case you will see that its made in canada not in hawaii or by hawaiians i gave the cd the benefit of the doubt and gave it a spin after listening to this abomination on my ears i felt as if i was trapped in a bad restaurant with a hawaiian theme and this cd was playing in the pa speakers|0
i really hate to be the negative one but this cd isnt that great compared to the one that is a much much better find the rudolph the rednosed reindeer soundtrack you can find that one here on amazoncom for cheaper  i bought this the other day hoping it would have the good songs from all those old shows but what it did have was all the good songs from rudolph and then some others which i really didnt find that appealing  i highly recommmend getting the rudolph soundtrack  its so much better and probably what youd enjoy more |0

the actors in this cast recording arent particularly bad although some of them are definitely inferior to those in the other cast recordings especially the 10th anniversray recording but it is frances ruffelle whos the worst here  she can emote all right but shes just not meant to be in musical theater  her voice is bad her diction is bad and her singing is bad  granted that her character in the book doesnt require a nice voice but this is musical theater and theatergoers do not have to be subjected to her constant screeching and whining and mumbling here  i think someone else in this review or in a review of some other les mis cd has already raised the point that a successful theater performance revolves around the ability to communicate and connect with the audience  theres no excuse for eating ones words and dragging ones lines making everything incomprehensible  the more important the ability to communicate becomes when theres another factor singing thats involved  no matter how effective ones facial expressions are the entire musical acting package is destroyed one is inarticulate and does not meet even the requirements of a secondrate singerfrances is not a good eponine and is a million miles away from being a great one  and im pointing this out as someone whos not even a lea salonga fan its kaho shimadas version i like better as one does not have to be a lea salonga fan who was just as good as kaho ill concede to that to see the very clear difference between a great musical theater acting performance and a thirdrate tryinghard attempt at eponines role|0
i knew a few of bill morrisseys songs and even saw him live at a small venue near the end of his life  it would have been easy to talk to him i have heard he was a very humble approachable guy but i missed the opportunity i regret that  his songs though make me feel like i knew him  casey illinois this aint hollywood and robert johnson are classics  man from out of town is a hauntingly beautiful song  great album|1
im a huge rush fan this album is great it takes a little effort getting into it since they whole albums tells a story from beginning to end i recommend listening to this with the lyrics in front of you to better enhance the experience|1
this is just david gilmour another solo album hidden under pink floyd name so it would sell no lyrics come close to rogers which is a great lyricist and even the melodies arent floydian this is not the sound of  pink floyd i mean if both the music and the lyrics are awful then it isnt  pink floyd sorry david but you should start doing somthing else than  lyricwriting and dont let your wife help you because she isnt even good  in it david is a good guitarist and its a shame that he cant write  better music on his own dont buy this cd but if you want something after  roger devision bell is better because some of the songs are listenable|0
the first album was good but this one is better  chickenfoot got some attention with their debut but now theyre establishing themselves as a musical force to be reckoned with  if you didnt get it the first time the guys will make sure you do so nowa strong songwriter in his own right sammy hagars collaboration with joe satriani is very much hitting the mark  its clear that these two musicians have a great songwriting chemistry this album is better than the debut with the partnership between hagar and satriani clearly bearing fruitthree and a half letters is worth the price of admission alone and its far from being the only good tune on the album  hagar knows who he is as a lyricist his lyrical style is plenty tough enough for the hard rock musical style but theres a generous dollop of heartfelt soulfulness here too  sammy both writes from the heart and calls em like he sees em  lyrically he doesnt try to be dylan he just tells it from his own perspective  its working just fine if you ask memichael anthony is putting in some great background vocals here and playing a mean bass guitar  whats refreshing is that hes no showoff its obvious the man can play but he clearly doesnt feel the need to try to impress anyone with his considerable chops  rather he lays down the bassline most beneficial to the song if a note is unnecessary he wont play it  in my book thats the mark of a fine musician  he plays according to whats best for the songjoe satriani puts in some amazing work here his riffs are infectious and his solos are oftentimes pieces of music in and of themselves  thats the mark of a great solo you could listen to it apart from the song in which it appears and it would still strike you as an impressive piece of music  if you are a satriani fan buy this album right nowchad smith is a great drummer and he lays down a tremendous groove with michael anthony  whats interesting here is that most of the time youll hear a band where the drummer rocks out whilst the bassist just holds down the groove think van halen or youll hear music where its clear the bassist wants to solo all night while the drummer just puts four on the floor  neither is happening here  smith and anthony are clearly focused on complimenting one anothers playing on every song  its obvious that they both spent time working out their arrangements before recording such that their grooves riffs and fills would both accentuate one anothers playing while adding a great deal of dimension and depth to the music  bravo says iall in all a very impressive effort  this album is an improvement over their debut these guys have found their footing  they know who they are as a band and if the improvement continues their third studio effort should be nothing short of amazing|1
after i started watching aeon flux i immediately liked it the soundtrack was amazingly unique and was perfectly matched to the visual i looked for a soundtrack disc for the series but initially could not find one then i looked at the music credits for the series and noted drew neumann that was the link if you are interested in great electronica this soundtrack is a must for your collection it is a pity the aeon flux series was so short lived|1
i ordered wish you were here and instead received a completely wrong record by a different artist it was addressed to me and when i opened it the inside was addressed to someone else it doesnt seem that hard to mail an album would not buy from these guys again|0
i owned a number of metheny albums on vinyl in the early 80s notably wichita falls and others i remember liking them at the time but i gradually grew disenchanted with the whole new age jazz thing as being kind of wimpy  vapid recently i heard metheny on another artists disk  recalled my initial positive impressions so when i saw offramp in the bin at my local used record shop i picked it upmistake this is really bland boring newagey kind of pablum in my opinion i suppose it makes for good background music i agree strongly with the one reviewer who said it is hard to tell where pat leaves off  where lyle picks up both are so heavily synthesized that the sounds are almost indistinguishable  unrecognizable as either a keyboard or a guitar there is nothing organic about this musicmetheny is a fine craftsman  is good at what he does i suppose if this is the sort of thing you are looking for well youve found a fine practitioner of the art in metheny  this is a fine example of the genre but it is not my cup of tea|0
i first heard this band on the radio and had mistaken it for a new kittie song but my friend told me that this was a band named flyleaf and i had to get the albumthe single out on the radio now im so sick was a sweet relief from all the male heavytoned stuff id been hearing lately the lead singers sweet voice remided me of tatu then she let out this awesome scream and that got me hooked i bought this cd for the single totally worth every penny as most of the songs on here are fantastic i especially like perfect and breath today check this group out|1
not enough thunder  the long periods of rain sounded like static  dissappointing|0
in the flesh is the best song here it always get to me the hairs on the back of my neck just stand up when that intro comes in loud but its pointless to name the strengths here it must be played in its entirety and loud|1
this is bad even by the beatles standards not even yellow submarine or ringos excellent drumming can save this one im afraid verdict avoid|0
same old stuff half a dozen albums repackaged with a different picture different title but same songs buy one of the other christmas albums|0
i expected more instrumentation of the classical songs i havent listened to it again for the appeal was falling short while i was listening to it the first time|0
the first time i heard kathy tracoli i instantly felt joy in my own soul as the words of each song spoke to me  i listen to this cd over and over in my car and feel the presence of god right there with me  she has become  my favorite christian artist not only because of her music but because her  love for christ through her music is genuine and refreshing  her music  lifts my spirits and blesses me every time i hear her sing|1
not quite as good as some of the old stuff but still very very good what makes it even better is my new found appreciation for older music it seems 99 of new music today blows chunks so a quality band like rush looks even better than they should heck they could beat on a trash can and sound better than the top 40 |1
this group rocks they sound very similar to the group fireflight i recommend purchase of both of these groups cds|1
dont let a song like im so sick fool you it did me at first  this is an absolutely gripping album and 955 of that comes right from the heart soul and mouth of lacey mosley there arent a huge amount of female vocalists that can floor me they could all be counted on one hand and even fewer who can do it with melodic singing alone which lacey obviously doesnt only do but she might as well have been the rocking guitars are somewhat standard not bad but not overwhelming and at times ill forget why i rate the album so high only for lacey to come back and sweep my off my feet again the timbre power emotion and quirkyness of her voice blend together a young everyday woman and an emotionally devastating artist get the special edition and listen to it from start to finish  if that doesnt convince you youre too far off this kind of music to even be reading this review and by this kind of music i dont mean christian music  this album does contain the jword but as i see it its up for interpretation and can be enjoyed even if youre an atheist just make sure youre an atheist with remnants of a heart somewhere|1
the wall is the best and most cohesive rock concept album so far it has some classic radio songs like another brick in the wall some great straightahead songs like mother and then several songs which tell the story more than stand up on their own like the other pink floyd albums this has wellrecorded songs memorable solos and dave gilmour does most of the singing|1
disc 2 has noise that sounds like radio static between stations a couple of other people i know on a music forum had the same problem we all ordered it because it cost 289 i returned it|0
i love this set its easy to find all the hits from these artist but alot of these are rare gems the book that goes along with it is also totally cool great stories and tons of rare photos the book  cd set are each stylishly packaged a true rock  roll dream come true and theyre only 15 bucks a piece dont wait youll be glad to have this history and information both in audio and book form|1
broke down and bought the remastered revolver the other night  listened down three times and here is my report its clean and clear but no improvement whatsoever over my 1982 britishpressed vinyl release on parlophone  thats not to say it isnt good but that pressing from 82 was always the one to beat to my earsthe big advantage of digital technology is not clarity but dynamic range  analog can be and typically is perfectly clear and defined but has limits especially in the case of vinyl as compared to tape with big shifts from soft to loud  the cd when it came out was touted as being able to accurately reproduce the dynamic flow that is present in all great music  instead it quickly became a convenient and portable medium and was not used much to improve dynamic range  the compression that had to be used on records to make them fit on vinyl was transferred intact to cds  occasionally you will find artists and producers like brian eno and daniel lanois who understand and exploit this aspect of digital but generally it has become the norm to use a lot of compression because it has a certain sound the sound of pop music on the radiorevolver and ill wager all the rest of the beatles remasters is highly compressed  bummer  tomorrow never knows good day sunshine and your bird can sing eleanor rigby should breathe with the dynamics of live performance  instead they are crystalclear but canned  this a too bad  the same team that did a great job on let it benaked which is a step in the right direction dynamically did these remasters but all theyve achieved is to make them sound like firstpress vinyl  again there is nothing wrong with that but it is so much less than it could be they could have put us in the room with the beatles  instead here we are in 2009 listening the beatles on the radio the dj spinning a very good pressing  just like old timesi compared the new revolvers eleanor rigby with the 1999s yellow submarine songtrack  yellow sub is it the hidden secret of the songtrack is that is a remix as well a remaster  and brother it is well done the gold standard for toptier beatles sonics  the big question is  wtf   why didnt they remix the new series the eleanor rigby from yellow sub is natural and full voice and strings are balanced and sound like a live performance in an intimate recital hall  the new revolver version sounds forced and unnatural  i think they are gonna hear from a lot audiophiles on this and will catch holy hell  at the least they should have lightened up on the compression|0
note this was originally for the review for the actual music cd release in 1999 and not the mp3 version amazoncom released in 2010 the amazon collection has 18 tracks the 1999 cd had 10 but both have and use redos and seem to not be the original tunes a number of the amazon release tracks seem pretty good indeed at the current price the amazon collection appears to be not a horrible value listen to the previews then decide to buy or not endon the back of music cd case in small print you will find the kiss of death statementthese tracks have been rerecords by the artists or one or more members of the original groupktel entertainment uk put this stuff together simply not even close to the original stuff we all know so well dont waste your money herepackaging is pretty nice but this isnt recommended|0
first of all the users who rated this 5 stars are all girls i heard one of their songs on mtv headbangers and damn they suck pretty bad her singer its a mix between avril lavigne and evanescence their songs sound all the same i dont see any difference this band blows ass if you want to hear real girls rocking maybe you prefer to hear kittie arch enemy or my ruin|0
this is a 2 disc concept album by pink floyd released in 1979 about a rock stars life his decent into madness and the consequences this is an exploration of lifes pressures and tragedies that can cause someone to snap every song is good as they can stand on their own but when all together they tell the story the music is great played very well with great solos drumming and keyboards there is also some good acoustic tracks as well the sound quality is also top notch you can hear every instrument very clearly this is another classic from pink floyd if your ready for a trip into a personal hell with great classic rock music it doesnt get better than this 5 stars also check out the film based on this|1
thought this was just an extended top gun soundtrack with youve lost that loving feeling great balls o fire etc but turns out this is some strange super cd format that none of my players or computers support never heard one track off this cd and although it is my fault for buying it and i should have returned the cd i have no idea what would play this cd i think the entire format was dead before i ever ordered this thing|0
excellent comedy clean a priceless jewel in todays market i just purchased the cd and dvd only 1 was available here|1
ive been a faithful follower of rush since fly by night album this album although somewhat similar to snakes and arrows is the pure sound that everyone loves its a reflection of life and what we need to learn by it they have such a wide range of rock to ballad that leaves you wanting more the lyrics are typical rush that adds depth and makes you think about what your listening to  awesome album that has it all a must have|1
i am a cancer survivor and a lonerthis helps my moodi am extremly depressed and angrythis music changes everything thanks|1
grammy worthy material throughout this album  though i can imagine the grammy committee looking at the song lengths and rolling their eyes  730   thats like 2 or 3 songs to the committee  and then rush fans laugh at the grammy committee as usual|1
i have six different recordings of this masterpiece and this particular recording is probably my least favourite of them all  its jarring to hear sprightly passages played too slowly making them seem to plod along  and its even worse to hear sensuous and languid portions like cour damours and uf dem anger played too quickly as if they were all in a hurry to get home  it ruins the effect completelyand dietrich fischerdieskau  i actually winced hearing him in his solo passages where hes supposed to sound impassioned and suffering to hear him warbling away like he thought he was singing lieder  sorry no  if you want to hear how it all should sound buy the cd with charles dutoit conducting the orchestre symphonique de montreal which is the finest version ive ever heard  the best use of tempo the best diction and the best soloists by farand please lets get something straight carmina does not rhyme with christina it rhymes with stamina carmen is a seconddeclension neuter noun in latin as is stamen and in the nominative plural the stress falls on the first syllable its carmina not carmeena it makes my hair stand on end to hear someone pronounce it like they think the ina is an italian diminutive ending like in manina it is notadded later  how pathetic that so many people have thought my review was not helpful  did they expect lies and smiley faces  they probably went right ahead and wasted their money anyway  i tried to warn them  chances are though they have no idea what the lyrics mean so it wont matter to them that dietrich fd sings them like he doesnt know what they mean eitheri even hope they will also ignore my correction of the frequent mispronunciation of the title because it can be quite hilarious to hear pseudosophisticates mangling pronunciations and thus announcing to the world that they really dont have a clue|0
i remember i was forced to put up with this cd when i was in grade school by stupid teachers that try to instill their values on every one of their students at my wonderful lutheran school addicted to jesus has got to be the worst song of all time we were forced to dance to it in front of the school like a bunch of  cherubs to this music i hate it and feel like crying when i remember it i am glad i am past that part of my life and have rejected christian music and now listen to kmfdm|0
this gifted group creates a joyous sound that will make you smile and your toes tap throughout the widely varied cuts on this disc  if you truly like international music and unusual and exciting rhythms this group is sure to  please|1
this is one funny man if you should catch him live or tv special he is even better because his facial expressions are the best with his jokes to listen to the cd well you will have to find a bathroom it is just to funny|1
the concept of the wall came from roger waters the member of pink floyd who played the most unspectacular instrument but offered ideas for his band that resulted in no 1 records this was again a concept album from floyd with songs that flow one into the other like a sad river mixed with sterling sound effects that whiz around in your head long after you hear them half of the walls greatness is in its sound effects ringing phones a ditzy groupie smashing objects the stern schoolteacher an isolatedsounding operator the falling bombs whirring planes kids screaming the insistent knocking of a door the tv incessantly changing from channel to channel all this extracurricular madness makes thedark side of the moonseem like a serene day at the office from the start this multimedia project well ahead of its time was under roger waters thumb unfortunately the bassists autocratic demeanor tolerated little room for collective brainstorming ultimately waters made it clear that miniscule credit would be shared with his band mates see for yourself in the gripping readsaucerful of secrets the pink floyd odysseyby nicholas schaffner 1991 as excellent and timeless as the wall is its sad that those involved cant look back on this opus as a true team projectthat said despite what people think the wall was far from a roger waters solo project the efforts of producer and mediator bob ezrin for example were immeasurable through all the harsh fights between waters and floyd guitaristdavid gilmour it was the patient and forceful ezrin who actually sorted out the songs on the wall giving it the coherence and structure that make the album so intense and unique the rough structures of songs were definitely in place from waters  as were his excellent lyrics  but initially they were rough and scrambled ezrin sorted waters songs out in one night then asked him to improve them keyboardist richard wright and drummer nick mason barely hovered in the background during the recording process both disinterested and largely ignored anyway eventually the pensive album took on a grandly produced operatic quality resembling a volatile play  or expensive rock video that most artists dont have the ambition money or fortitude to create all in all studio time was tense and the  alreadydrifting members of pink floyd drifted even further away from each other this was to be their last worthwhile and outstanding work and of course waters accepted nearly all of the creditthe wall has lots to say about the disillusionment and isolation of our time themes like growing up without a father because of war dealing with fame going crazy the similarities between being in a successful rock outfit on a crazy tour and going to war losing a wife and shielding yourself  brick by painful brick  from the harshness of an often cold world all cast their shadow largely on this record despite all this bleakness and not one shred of levity to lighten the load  unless its portrayed extremely sarcastically  the music is excellent as always this is where gilmour came in along with ezrin to save the day the talented guitarist gets three writing credits for three excellent songs but word has it that gilmour put his stamp on a great deal more of the wallin the final analysis the wall offers a glimmer of hope in the end though it comes after a lifetime of learning and selfpity some may  fault waters for a feeble toosensitive approach to life as well as a depressing outlook be that as it may the opportunity to peer into the window of his brain proved to be the best thing he could do for music  and the world painful or not the wall stands as as one of the best  collection of songs ever recorded|1
you may also know this album of the art of seduction belly dance music i almost purchased it again not realizing that it was recycled with a different cover the cd is good when you need or want very traditional music with an emphasis on vocals the recording is not the best it really should have been digitally remastered before putting it out againif you dance in a very traditional atmosphere or just want something in the back of your music collection just in case  then this is a good oneif not skip this one|0
this is by far one of the best albums i have purchased in years myles kennedy paired with slash is pure genius along with the songwriting i was never a huge slash fan but this album has changed my mind the guitar work is absolutely amazing and fluid myles kennedy is not only great in alter bridge but his vocals just ring through on this album if you like just good solid rock and roll you will love this album along with the great groove it has dont hesitate to pick this up you will not regret it|1
bar none the worst sondheim compilation andor concert to ever be foisted together  many of the artists were likely very busy when they committed to this project but that does not excuse the utter shoddiness of some of the performers preparation  worst example  the tenor in the kiss me quartet from sweeney todd sings most of his music wrong or late or early or all three combined  other examples of mediocrity include inane gender switching  the cassidys singing you could drive a person crazy  and a notable veneer of passionless performances  on that last note i got the distinct impression the performers were sightreading their scores  this cd remained in my collection for several years simply because i was maintaining a comprehensive sondheim collection i just downsized my library and this was the first cd to get sold on ebay|0
pink floyd gives it all beautifully orchastrated music of heightened intensity and melancolic despair  the lyrics are overwhelmingly thought provoking and emotionally stimulating ingeniusly incorporated with every beat of the music  you will be forever moved beyond words  this is the reason i wanted this album  however its been 2 12 weeks and i have yet to receive it|1
this is by far one of my favorite albums he has done  the other being the big picture|1
raffi is great music for the entire family  all the children love it from the babies to the big kids  we dont mind it either  raffis music has really stood the test of time  i highly recommend these cds and all others by raffi|1
a very worthy addition to the rush catalog i took the entire family ages 1453 to this tour performed in seattle everyone enjoyed it and after seeing it performed the album was a universal must buy even from those who only have a casual interest in my favorite band of all timei recommend getting the digital booklet edition or the cd its the best way for getting the context of the overall storyi hope i hold up as well as these veteran rockers have|1
some real trivia about this band that is intersting i was at my first concert with my newest girlfriend seeing mitch ryder minus the wheels back in 1967 at indiana university the illusion was opening up for mitchthey were just ok and dressed in the hippy looking clothes i wait for what seemed an eternity and mitch jumps on stage and who do i see the guys in the ilusion dressed in satin tuxs with their long hair slicked down these guys were definetly not the wheels my first concert turned about to be really bad why mitch thought these guys could back him up with his style of music is beyond me he might as well have me or the nitty gritty dirt band up there|0
a bad judge in a bad court system allowed ringo starr mason and wright and george harrison gilmour to call themselves the beatles  but since ringo and george dont have any talent compared to john and paul roger waters they were forced to go on a scavenger hunt to try to find people to help them sound like roger waters  check the song credits for this album  instead of the song credits saying waters like they do with all the great songs on all the great pink floyd albums the song credits on this terrible album basically say everybody and their dogs  in other words it would have saved space to simply list all the people on our planet who did not have a hand in creating these awful songs rather than actually listing all the people who were brought in to try to sound like rogerlisten to the song on this album called dogs of war  that song is the most universally hated pink floyd song of all time  many people find that it is actually interesting to listen to dogs of war and other songs on this album as it is like watching an a car wreck  it clearly shows what happens to a group of people when all the intelligence work ethic and creativity are gonepersonally i actually think it is almost fun to listen to this album for a good belly laugh  it is like watching the movie plan 9 from outer space  you watch it because it is so bad it is a decent laughyou may have noticed that whenever you hear a pink floyd song on the radio it is always a roger waters song  thus we conclude that although ringo and george were able to convince a stupid judge sitting in a stupid court to allow the blasphemous use of a sacred name the public knew better and has responded by not buying this trashmy suggestion  stay away from this dog of an album|0
while some of the songs are great the cd does not contain several of the songs listed which include some of the reasons i purchased this cd  i am surprised that there is not a quality check prior to offering the cd for sale|0
i was expecting this amazing production from my favorite artist and received the cd with the album when i played the cd it had the songs from ojala que llueva cafe even though i love this album is not what i ordered not a good experience never buying from you again|0
i steered clear from this album for a long time because i was afraid it would sound like white dudes playing jazz  i was wrong  it sounds like old white dudes playing jazz  the only worthwhile song is take five and its likely due to the fact that its the one tune not composed by brubeck  simple overpolished snoresville  music as toothless as the denturewearing men performing it|0
rhino really screwed up with the american comedy boxthe cover has a raised image in plastic of a pair of groucho gag eyeglasses with nose and mustache but look inside the package theres not a marx brother to be found anywhere an excerpt of one of grouchos many 1940s radio appearances would have been most welcome here speaking of radiotheres nothing from burns  allen jack benny milton berle fred allen or fanny brice vaudeville and radio stars all so what do we get from that great comic medium a lesser stan freberg single a weak henry morgan track and two tepid bob  ray routines and thats it oh and where are jonathan winters prof irwin corey don rickles bob newhart pat cooper rusty warren don adams and so many others theres no firesign theater or pdq bach on this album either so why nota further problem are the tracks that are here smith  dale were certainly pioneers yet their recording isnt vintage its the last one these old vaudevillians made from the early 1960s  it seems that in the majority of other cases better material was available for instance why an excerpt of 2000 and two year old man and not the original classic brooks  reiner routine why a tom lehrer song from 1965 instead of his great earlier stuff or al n yetta rather than hello muddah hello faddah all bad bad choicesthe guaranteedtodisintegrate tabloidstyle newspaper liner notes are a poor decision too mine has already yellowed and frayed finally why do the four cds average only an hour each for these reasons and more the american comedy box could have been so much better  not recommendedtotal running times disc one pioneersradio  the moviesmusical comedy  5947disc two political humoroneliners  4804disc three storytellerssketches  6226disc four charactersstandups  6051|0
if you are one of those who mistake volume and overproduction for creativity you will undoubtedly agree with all of the glowing reviews here  i checked out this album and thought it harmless enough  two nights ago i had the misfortune of seeing them in concert thankfully i didnt have to pay for the ticket  wailing guitars pyrotechnics lasers falling snow band members running through aisles physically exaggerated guitar licks and plenty of fistpumping did not impress me  it merely served to distract me as the albums overproduction distracted me from the pretentiousness and mediocrity of this musicits hard not to like the studio sarajevo but this train derails very quickly beyond it|0
the music and performance is fantastichowever the cd quality is very poor if you try to listen to it at a higher sound level you will find this very inconsistent sound levels on the cd not acceptable|0
very funny  the only way to make this better is to have seen the outrageous expressions he can create on his face|1
ive got this cd and its not too bad but if youre not a powell fandont buy it|0
this album rockschickenfoot is a powerful bandgreat songsgreat riffsjoe satriani and sammy hagar shows how to make a great album in these days|1
i love the fact that we can listen to this cd with the kids without worrying about what hes going to say next  the kids were rolling with laughter in the back seat and asked to listen to it again when it was over  it made for a quick trip|1
what else can be said about these masters of their craft they have made an disc of songs that ranks up there with their best|1
i was a bit skeptical hearing a while back that myles and slash were making a complete album  well they proved me wrong  this album does not contain a single track i would consider filler  not very many records have been released in recent history that i feel the same aboutthe singing is some of myles most diverse since fallout by the mayfield four  all sound the same  hardly the case here  quite a few different sounds mixed in with that rockanthem high pitched wailing  it all fits the style perfectly  i dont miss that rose guy for a secondslashs guitar work on this record is nothing short of amazing  brings me back to the appetite days in high school  its fresh and energetic  the intro to anastasia really stands out for methe entire band seems to gel and the record sounds like they have been together for some time  it just fits  same for the production  very cleanhighly recommended purchase to any fan of energetic rock and roll music|1
i had one of the cds for my younger grandkids but it was very scratched  was glad i could find a replacement the little ones really enjoy the songs and was glad i could get a 3 cd set of some other songs|1
not really funny  i wanted to like this album bad but its just not timeless like steve martin  not worth the money|0
this is a good place to start for a new comer to pink floyd  this is probably the best place to go for a fan of roger waters who is unsure about the rest of the band  the two cds come together to make what can be best described as a rock opera that portrays an artist gone mad  the music is great but the story makes it something special most songs are short and morer like fragments that come together to create a journey into pain torment and finally the other side of the wall also reccomended the movie of the same title|1
so youve either been looking for the version of when doves cry that was in the movie or the first soundtrack wasnt enough  well if the former is true you simply have to decide whether its worth it to buy a whole album for one song  but in the other scenario you have a bigger problem  this album is nothing like the first  i enjoy instrumental music but this cd just depresses me  the album is amazing in that it has so much power to bring a person down  o verona is great when you want to crank it up and yell along with the music and the instrumental version of kissing you is incredible  the second half of the album however actually made me crysomething a cd without memories attached to it has never done before  buy it if youre really into classical or if you noticed that you enjoyed the background music during the movie  do not buy it if youre looking for an encore to the first soundtrack|0
rush one of the bands that got me into playing the guitar i had lost touch with them a while ago but there were so many glowing reviews in guitar magazines about the new album i decided to pick it up it is fantastic and typical or rush music you have to listen to it a number of times to really get it but once you do itll be in your playlist rotation for a long time|1
an adequate cd but one may as well buy any ordinary christmas album nothing here is special to beauty and the besat beauty and the beast without angela lansbury is a disturbing thought a real disappointment that she isnt on there if she was the rating would no doubt have risen to 5 starsfancy putting talent a broadway star in a musical and not writing her a number or two crazy|0
i have bought over 400 cds this is the only one i have ever returned because it was crap these songs are not the versions from the show they have been rerecorded and have none of the energy or humour of the originals buyer beware this album sounds like a bad lounge jazz band urinating all over great songs if you buy this you will be very disapointed or maybe just a blissfully ignorant moron who cant tell the differencebtw when is this show coming out on dvd|0
this lifts your heart to god as you listen  beautifully done|0
rush is the best what more can i say this cd is one of their best they keep on going thanks to neil alex and getty youre the best|1

there is so much to combat in our thoughts that tend to be worriful and negetive rhondas tapes help create new thought patterns steeped in scripture and soothing to the nerves and mind meditation isnt just for those of eastern religionsmeditation on gods affirming word is very much a christian practice david meditated often on the precepts and wonders of god in the crazy world we live in these tapes help to bring some peace of mind and much needed solace|1
i actually play this during tai chi practice i enjoy the sounds and rhythms and find the entire album relaxing and conducive to the semi meditative state this is worthy|1
seeing as nobody has yet reviewed the 2012 vinyl edition i thought id be the first to start its a phenomenal reissue despite the price tag nearly 50 anyway the artwork is nearly identical to the original 1979 release and the vinyl is 180 grams its a very good pressing with no unwanted surface noise great dynamics too dont be fooled by the poorly pressed dsotm release from a few months back this is pretty much as good as vinyl reissues get also included is a new poster which is probably around five by five feet it contains all of the lyrics to the album printed over a brick overlay much like the cover its a very nice touch anyway dont let the hefty price tag deter you from purchasing this it really is a quality product and the music is absolutely brilliant|1
one of their worst no doubt perhaps not as abysmal as some make it out but does that really say anything this late 80s backfired comeback is drenched in lifeless production halfcooked experimentation and exploited past glories particularly how gilmour tries in vain again and again to relive the heights of his comfortably numb guitar solo throughout these hollow compositions producing their definitive over50 album for tailgate parties|0
song by song i found the album veryvery poortaxman   multimillionaires whining about their taxbill unbecominglove you to  i want to tell you  truly horrific peice of midsixties nonsense i want  to tell you is physically painful to listen to both these songs lack any  merit whatsoevergood morning sunshine  sounds like the cheesiest  cornflakes jingle ever writtenyellow submarine  if you are under 5 you  may like this songshe said and your bird can sing dr robert   pointless three poor guitar riffs set to dire melodies and lyrical  fluffhere there and everywhere for no one  paul mcartney at his  sickly sweet best cloying and profoundly annoyingeleanor rigby  tomorrow never knows  the two songs that made the albums reputation  eleanor rigby deserves the albums one star review whilst the beatles  attempt at avant garde on tomorrow never knows ends in an embarrassing  sellout of corny pianos almost apologising for their daring  venture outside the world of preteen bubblegum popi would recomend  you steer well clear of this dreadful album|0
i have bought quite a few albums recently this album is so thin it wont  play it was a present for my son and he just reminded me|0
walter krafts playing is technically advanced but unimaginative most pieces are just played along either too fast or too slowly with virtually no climaxes i was especially upset by his rendition of the toccata adagio  and fugue in c bwv 564 adagio was ok but toccata sounded like a race  just to get it over with in the fugue whose very music commands it to be  crystalsharp and dancelike the pedal registration was so heavy and muddy  that it pulled the manuals down with iti wouldnt recommend  this cd to a serious music lover however it presents a good lesson in how  to keep a steady tempo throughout a piece and could be useful as an  educational tool|0
watch out track 9 blew up 2 sets of very expensive speakers tweeters  very dangerous i broke them and threw them away  pink noise is very dangerous not worth the risk  use classical concert instead|0
raffi is by far my daughters favorite childrens music singerand mine as well  this 3disc set has all the raffi you could ever want and makes for a fun time and play and dance from start to finish  i highly recommend this for you baby toddler or preschooler|1
i think the great thing about this album is the way that the entire thing is really one work although several of the songs are very good by themselves the plot of the album is not particulary detailed but i like that  it gives you the freedom to make up the details on your own and there is definitely a theme that runs altheway through it there is also a variety in the type of songs some are softer comfortably numb and some are harder run like hell and some are comic the trial i could listen to this probably a million times|1
it was that fateful day when roger waters spat at fans in response to the disturbances they were creating that the magnificent concept of a wall of isolation between the band and the fans came to mind  waterss brilliant lyrics take you on the journey of a tragic rock star named pink and the terrible crises that he confronts in his life  the emotion expresson and magnificence of this album cannot be expressed in words however thats just the songwriting  pink floyd doesnt fail to impress us here in any way shape or formvocally the combined vocals of david gilmour and roger waters combine to create some of the best vocal performances in rock the trial  the guitar work is perhaps at its all time peak with such solos as on another brick in the wall hey you young lust and most of all comfortably numb a solo which can even rival stairway to heaven in terms of emotion and greatness  the keyboard work though a little weaker than previous efforts such as wish you were here is as essential to pink floyds sound as ever  waters and mason are a solid and dynamic rhythm section throughoutthough some tracks on this album are weaker than others its a concept album and these tracks are for the sake of the album  thats not to say that they arent highlights  another brick in the wall remains to this day to be a powerful anthem hey you is one of the most emotionally moving pieces ive ever heard young lust is catchy and has a great beat mother is another amazing track and comfortably numb possibly the best on the album remains to be one of my favorite songs of all timethis isnt even pink floyds greatest album dark side of the moon which just goes to show how amazing they really were  do yourself a favor and purchase this album  it is just sheer brilliance throughout|1
nothing to add about this classic album by pink floyd its  a good album for surebut the quality of this new lp pressing from 2011 is horrible the lp is very noisy even if it was cut at the mastering lab they usually do a great job at remastering albums and also cut great vinyl they must have use cheap vinyl for that release they include the original poster who is a very bad copy of the original one grainy picture and blur a poster that wasnt include in the usuk original version and only in the japan one also include 2 postcard the lp come into a black bag like the original one and can be reseal the original one cant be reseali think its a better idea to find a nm original copy of the original lp and buy it and not buy this new 180 grams lp edition i own the original columbia pressing and even if my copy have a lot of noises from scratch the sound is better a lot better than on this new remastering edition|0
maybe i am not ready to appreciate this but for the moment this cd is just awful to my ears sorry for the die hard fans|0
the qualities of riccis performance and even the undisputed beauties and complexities of the works recorded here are merely suggested by the awful quality of the sound recording it is more likely the work of an amateur one might guess if it has ever been authorized by the artist excruciatingly distorted and thoroughly covered by hiss and pops  the clearest parts are the applauses there isnt anything like balance here worse yet ricci seems not to be at his best although making any rendition about his performance is a heroic piece of guessingwhatmightbehappeningnowbeyondthoseannoyingnoises a serious candidate to be immediately returned by any customer who dares to buy it despite all my efforts to warn you so dont|0
dont like this annoying music at all this music is more irritating than relaxing i usually have to get out of bed to remove th cd i gave it several chances and decided its not for me|0
i am a beginner and have tried a couple of meditation cds on the market but have disliked them due to poor audio quality and all the far east philosophy they try to get you to buy into i simply wanted a quick way to get started meditating so that i could relieve my stress after a long day this cd has been a blessing as it is easy to understand and benefit from the music and the sound effects help me regulate my breathing and synchronize to the guided meditations i highly recommend this for anybody looking to improve their quality of life and mental focus and dont want to spend a lot of money or have to subscribe to complicated spiritual values from india or china  i had my wife try it and she loves it now we meditate together and it has brought us closer and even increased passion in our relationship i will give this as gifts as the price is great for the lifeimproving benefits it provides this is a cd for everyone|1
i love the beatles love thembut these stereo remasteredenhanced versions i went and bought a bunch of them are really just unlistenable|0
the wall is often considered one of the greatest albums of all time and it is deserving of every bit of praise it receives  pink floyds most epic emotional and mature work it is 80 minutes of pure brillianceone of the coolest things about the album is that you can hear so much influence from it in newer bands  youre constantly reminded throughout how big of an impact its had on the music world  listen to goodbye blue sky and see where alice in chains got their haunting vocal harmonies  listen to run like hell and youll see where u2 got their trademark echoic guitar effects  listen to vera and youll see where counting crows got their heartwrenching melodic rock style  and so on and so forthand of course this album has heralded a plethora of classics such as hey you another brick in the wall mother young lust and what is quite simply one of the greatest songs i have ever heard comfortably numb  and of course theres the incredibly powerful waiting for the worms the anguished ballad dont leave me now and the absolutely demented closer the trial  ok there are about 30 songs and im not going to go through all of them but for for this albums tremendous length there is not a weak spot to be foundthis is a simply beautiful and revolutionary album and no one should be without it  regardless of your tastes any fan of any kind of rock music should find something they like here  pink floyd are forever gods in the rock and roll worldoh and go buy animals if you dont already have it  its majorly underappreciated|1
ill keep this short and sour this album blows martins vocal headache inducing shrieks get on my nerves and his lyrics are as embarrassing as his voice is unpleasant quite an accomplishment cozy powell while a solid drummer never rises above indistinct and the bassist may as well not even have been playing perhaps he used the black metal bass pedal which is audible only to those who are trve kvlt of course that pedal may not have been available when this album was recorded iommis riffs are more hair metal than heavy metal with a few exceptions and are completely inappropriate to the lyrical content which while dark is less sophisticated than bottom shelf black metal fantasy at least dios lyrics while sometimes idiotic usually made no sense so werent quite as silly or embarrassing  martins however are distinct and satan is mentioned in every song geezer where are you theres nothing real sincere or artful about any of headless cross not the music not the lyrics all the listener is left with is contrived product after dio left the first time this band rarely delivers and this time they sound like they didnt really try pathetic|0
ive heard them all  the songs are weak the good ones are few and far between the storyline is incoherent it was good to listen to when one is 12 etc it is only after listening to the wall over many years that one can appreciate its true message  one that is cynical dark and brutalthe wall is not totally dissociated from the whos tommy both are rock operas that are darkly thematic if the good songs are few and far between in the wall then this case is exacerbated in tommy where we only see the occasional flashes of brilliance both stories are equally coherent or perhaps incoherent and both are equally ambitious however the wall is lyrically and musically superior with infinitely better production values and you can thanks roger waters and dave gilmour for thatenjoy the wall for what it is not for what you want it to be|1
this is an excellant collection for kids of all ages my only disappointment was that baby baluga was not part of this collection and that there was no way to know that before i purchased it|1
i didnt read close enough that this wasnt the soundtrack and what i was looking for wasnt this  so it went in the ggodwill box|0
this is a curious disc that is sold as juan luis guerra y 440 but does not feature juan luis guerra taking the familiar lead vocals very often like on  many later discs what you are left with is a sort of chorus singing with lead occasionally by an unknown female voice or guerra where he barely distinguishes himself from the chorus imagine a sort of  breezy brazil 66 sound with multiple voices 440singing in unison to a latin jazzy beat there is really no merengue with the exception of sambomba but there is lots of group singing that sometimes does some scat singing to sound like a latin version of manhattan transfer i really like juan luis guerra and remember when i bought this some years back to be very disappointed from one person who admires jlgs works to another look elsewhere for a good disc of his  this is definitely not it  this was probably his start before he made it big with his more well known discs like ojala qe llueve cafe or areito you would hardly know this is a juan luis guerra cd the original band is obviously not as good as when he took the lead vocals this is a very forgetable disc actually annoying on certain  songs and  recommended for die hard fans of the group only unless you are interested in jlg before his rise skip this disc and go for his other discs mentioned or his greatest hits the booklet opens  revealing two sheets of clean white paper with nothing written it has an exploitive running time of 33 20|0
the music of heinrich schuetz is grounded not only in solid counterpoint but also in the natural rhythms of the german language and somewhat less pointedly latin  as a result a good and godly performance even in a lutheran church before a solemn congregation demonstrates clarity among the various voices as they move over under and against one another in delicious polyphony and yet also expresses the emotions behind the words the shifting of feeling and mood within a piece and among the pieces in a collectionthe dresdener kreuzchor sang this music for decades under the direction of rudolf mauersberger from 1930 until his death in 1971  they established or passed along a tradition of how schuetzs music should sound  to my ears this tradition as presented to us on these cds is one of stolid heavyhanded unmoving and quite minddulling musicmakingthese performances are sung one composition after the other in the same heavy tempo and the same unyielding mezzoforte dynamic  the choirs intonation is fine but the vocal quality is a bit raw and unforgiving  the 1994 digital remastering of the 1972 edition of these performances from 1962 is poorly done  one hears distortion in the treble voices and the orchestral ensemble and organ are barely audiblewhat should the music of schuetz sound like  i direct your attention to recordings by three different groups each of which performs schuetz somewhat differently from the others but each of which reveals the life and spirit inherent in the music1  john eliot gardiners recording of 4 motets and the german funeral music with the monteverdi choir the englilsh baroque soloists and his majesties sagbutts and cornetts on dg archiv 19882  paul mccreeshs imaginative and loving attempt with the gabrieli consort and players to recreate  christmas vespers as it might have been sung in dresden about 1664 including schuetzs version of the christmas story as well as three related motets dg archiv 19993  craig smiths generous recording with emmanuel music of boston of twentyone motets and psalm settings in both german and latin koch 1991im a softhearted fellow  i hate to write a negative review  i try to say as many positive things as i can about a performance  this time however with all due respect for my fellow reviewers the most positive comments i can make are about alternatives to this set of cds|0
last year against the advice of a cast member i went to see a production of colette collage in chicago  the actors in the company did a fantastic job with terrible source material  this was a truly horrifying play with a score that borders on the absurd  songs like do it for willy the dog and cat duet and decorate the human face had lyrics that were just laughable  the true lowmoment of the score though is be my lady that is reminiscent of a cheezy 70s love song  this is an awful show with an awful score  do yourself a favor and avoid buying this recording|0
perhaps in 1972 this was a bold statement  but even then as a nineyearold i despised the selfrighteous but whiny tone in almost every song  of course men and women have equal potential and a just society must recognize that  but this album is only a celebrity vanity project it is about feeling morally superior not about changing anythingwhen i remember this album i think of john belushi in animal house when he hears the smarmy soulfulness of a campus bard  if you dont know what he does get that video for your kids instead of this record  at least that is genuinely funny unlike this humorless propaganda|0
ive had this album for a very long time  smitty shares the microphone with different choirs  and a full orchestra  the sound is fantastic  and you find yourself getting drawn into the musici lent my cd to some friends  and after two years had to wrestle it out of their handsthis is a christmas album that you will want to included in your collection|1
this was a nobrainer purchase for me being a negativland fan ive been following them for years and i really enjoy the idea behind the book i remember hearing about the u2 fiasco but getting all the details presented in a book format was awesome id purchase this again in a heartbeat|1
for me this was the pinnacle for pink floyd  most people consider dark side of the moon or even wish you were here as their high point but i disagree  and not because of the albums significant sales  it simply finds floyd reaching way beyond the sound effects and putting together its best lyrical messages by farone of my favorite elements of the album is the cycle element  if you listen closely to the very beginning of in the flesh youll hear quiet accordion playing that sounds like it started in the middle  thats because it didits a continuation of the accordion playing at the end of the albums last song outside the wall and is seemingly cut off  this invites you to understand that this is a cycle of life that begins ends and restartsand the songs are magnificent  in the flesh is gripping in its invitation to listen concluding with a spiralling plane crash that ends abruptly before its inevitable conclusion to a babys soft crying  this is roger waters representation of his fathers death in a ww ii plane crash at the time of waters birth  mother is a stirring ode to overprotection doubtless brought on by having to raise a child alone  sandwiched between the birth and mothers overprotection is the anthem another brick in the wall pt ii the official theme song of schoolboy rebellion  the album progresses into waters teen life with him coming of age in young lust and then turning his rage from his negative school and home experiences on a potential lover in one of my turns  finally rejected by everyone he turns inward inside his wall on the song that concludes the first disc goodbye cruel worldon the second disc he shows regret for his isolation on the marvelous nobody home waxes nostalgic on bring the boys back home and vera and then out comes the dual vocal and amazing guitar of the signature comfortably numb a song about the life of a rock star needing artificial assistance to get through a show  the last songs on the package run a gamut of emotions  the rapture of the show must go on which sounds like an extension of his relaxed state from numb the sudden turn on the audience with a racist rant in the reprise of in the flesh the return of authority in run like hell and then the theatrical the trial which sentences the social outcast to the worst possible sentence  his flaws laid bare for all to seeall in all the wall is a lyrical peak for this legendary band  waters would stay for only one more album 1983s weak the final cut before leaving for good  even at 30 this album is still an excellent investment and a vital part to any collection|1
wowreallyi bought it because i have every rush release ever a life long fanso i had to get it  i am more of a 2112 type fan but i still dig power windows too  there was nothing here that caught my ear as being something special  sorry guys  you let me down|0
my children ages 5 and 3 enjoy listening to this story on car trips  odds bodkin is a master storyteller|1
rating  2 12 stars out of 5first things first i have a pet peeve  it has to do with bands calling themselves orchestras  i have no problem with an orchestra incorporating instruments traditionally used in rocknroll  electric guitar electric bass your peartesque drum kit  however if you have those instruments and replace the woodwinds brass and strings sections with synthesizers you are not in my opinion an orchestra  you are a bandso when the cd label said american film orchestra i was expecting philharmonic  now i know better  if i want a full orchestra i should look or philharmonic on the labelto be fair the arrangements are good and the musicians have talent  this would be pleasant music to have pumped through overhead speakers while walking around a science center  thats why i didnt completely bash it with my rating  but its just not what i was looking forin fact when i listened to the star trek generations overture i thought for a moment should be watching babylon 5  those of you who know me from graduate school will appreciate the humor in that  not that im bashing b5 music  its quite good but it was originally arranged on synthesizers so it sounds good when played on synthesizers  not so much with star trek|0
great songs terrible productionmix seems like nick r likes to throw a wet blanket over the whole mix the original mixes of caravan and bu2b were way better now they sound all muddied and bass heavy like the rest of album snakes and arrows had a great mix what the hell happened ill give it 5 stars when they remix it in 2023|1
i was very disappointed in this one i wish i could exchange it not the songs i wanteddont know if i want to continue|0
it is not the original cast the broadway cast or the london cast  so who are these people i can say its a rather lifeless some what by the numbers version  but good it is not|0
there is a reason why my rating of this album is low  its because the powers that be lawyers business people etc decided to call it a pink floyd album  there have been many reviews stating things like give it a chance or dont listen to what people say  if this recording were originally presented to us as a david gilmour solo album or just an album of a band whose members included gilmour mason and wright then i would have given it perhaps three or four stars  its not a bad album  its just not a pink floyd album  the drum work of nick mason is its usual solid and dependable  the keyboard playing of rick wright is as always subtle and jazzy  the guitar work of david gilmour is magnificent  yes  its really really good  gilmours guitar phrasings and most importantly soloing are in perfect form  his vocals are also quite good  still pink floyd as an idea as a mode and style of music is completely missing from this album  however hard it tries its not there at all  yes there will never be another dark side or wish you were here  but when say animals came out people didnt shout its not wish you were here  they didnt have to  animals was pure floyd just as the wall was  just as was every other album that had roger waters in its makeup  those albums stood by themselves while still retaining whatever it was that made them a pink floyd album  i recommend a momentary lapse of reason to people who like good rock and roll guitar  other than that i would advise against buying it|0
i am not sure of how many reissuesrepackagingsremasterings have been done with the wall but it will always remain as one of my favorite cds of all timesdont pay excessive attention to roger waters child conflicts which helped develop the background argument to the wall i am not sure of how universal his conflicts can becomeit is better just to listen to the songs to each one of them most new listeners will discover inmortal classics such as confortably numb my personal fave hey you mother part ii run like hell and the ending theme the trial one the most complex things floyd did in this moment of their historyaway are the psychedelic 60s and the 80s decadence was about to begin for them but this very moment was both experimental and commercially succesful an achievement that not many bands can getabsolutely recommended both for pop fans as for prog rock enthusiasts|1
im not one of those purist jazz folk who felt gary burtons move to the grp record label was a bad thing  in fact  i like and even love in one instance some of the dates gary did during his years there  it was a smart move to be certain  the stated goal of expanding garys audience and hence that of the jazz community was most certainly achieved the recording that i really love that gary did for grp was and remains reunion with pat metheny  mitchel forman  will lee and peter erskine  other recordings ive heard and like include times like these with john scofield  marc johnson  peter erskine and a couple of lovely quest spots for michael brecker  very fond of that one indeed  nearly excellent record in fact in my opinion  i even with a fair bit of blush in my face and shame in my heart enjoy cool nights  difficult to strongly disparage for me a lovely smooth jazz record featuring the likes of worfgang muthspiel  bob james  bob berg  and again  will lee and peter erskine so what went so wrong here  everything really  on paper things look fairly strong  a couple of things should gives pause to even the most casual of jazz fans though  what on earth are b b king and paul shaffer doing on this recording  it gets a lot worse from there though  its at this point that ill defer to the penguin guide to jazz 1994 new edition  burtons continuing love affair with the guitar goes public with this rather odd lineumup  the title track and double guatemala with b b king are a joke  rosenwinkle is pretty anonymous  and only sco and hall really seem to know what theyre about  burtons own playing has gone to pot  in the sense that he seems content to string together bits and pieces from old solos  there are  of coarse  moments of interest  but for the most part this is a rummage sale to accomplish these results with all the spectacular musicians assembled is nothing short of astounding in my opinion  stop  look and listen  seriously |0
i had heard a few of flyleafs songs on the radio which i really liked  after buying the cd and listening to it a few times they have a very unique and different sound of most music i own  it takes a little while to get used to their sound but its overall a good cd|1
watch out with this new series of beatles who are supposed to be remastered and made in japanthis not the case this is a false japanese mini lp they all come from lethonie  estonie and russia the quality is ok but not good as a japanese they are a lot of defeats in the overall presentation but the most important thing its absolutely not remastered and the sound is exactly the same as the original even below  also those cds are not in closeable plastic enveloppe as all japanese cd even brand new they had scratchs and are not cleanas a collector of japanese mini lp who bought this one i assure you this is a fake|0

that monumental concept album the wall is a classic is pretty well known by now the problem with this release is that it is missing two songs when the original vinyl lp came out there were two songs what shall we do now and the last few bricks that they had two cut because there wasnt enough recording space on that old medium however with cds there is no such space restriction so how come the songs arent here the live version is there anybody out there the wall live includes the two missing songs|1
its as if karajan had downed a bottle of scotch and a couple of vallium with one hand and grimly held up his baton in the otherhis conducting of turandot is so meanderingly slow that you fear the whole thing will grind to a complete halt at any momentcasting wise hendricks makes a fine lui the part of calaf probably sits a little too high for domingo and ricciarelli sounds as if she turned up to sing lui but got a nasty shock when told shell be screaming away as turandot regardless she ploughs on as if she were singing  lui anywaybottom line is  if you want your turandot to sound like a sonic funeral dirge then by all means go for this onemehtas version with sutherland and pavarotti remains first choice|0
i wanted to like this album i really did  but every time i tried to listen to it i was disappointed by the muddiness  and lack of clarity  geddy  lee sounds like he is wailing in a tunnel during a hurricane  i cant pick out the drums  guitar  or bass over the maelstrom of background noise in the songs  their  past albums were precise and all parts  of the music could be listened to separately or as a whole  but not this  this band was once a well oiled machine  but now it desperately needs a tune up  which is a sadly ironic  thing to say about an album titled  clockwork angels  ill never give up on the band itself  they have been the soundtrack of my life for over 20  years  but every time i try  to listen to this album i end up cussing at the stereo and switching to any other album of theirs and remembering how good they used to sound|0
the pink floyd albums i listen to the most are animals wish you were here the wall dark side of the moon and momentary lapse of reason is good but to me may as well go under a different band namethere is not a song on the wall i dont like matter of fact some of them feel like a part of me and i dont get that as much from the other albums i fond that for me there are some albums that i like right off and there are some that take time to sink in before i really start to like them this was one that took a little time to sink in but as with most albums that reach me that way once it sunk in i was in love  ok that sounds gay but thats how music hits you sometimesthe story is pretty cool what makes this album great to me is that the frustration and emotions of the main character that comes through roger waters voice comes through with such with such beleivable emotion i mean really the words could just as well be anything because the melodies are good enough to carry the songs on their own however the story is good is believable and anyone can identify withthere are great guitar solos around every turn nice musical pasages everywhere beautiful piano as well the special effects are not overdone and seem appropriate and on time i also really like the fact that this was a two record set its helps with the drama of the unfolding story in side one we see the mounting tension confusion agitation and sliding of sanity of the main character  side one ends with the beautiful goodbye cruel worldgoodbye cruel worldim leaving you todaygoodbye goodbye goodbyegoodbye all you peopletheres nothing you can sayto make me change my mindgoodbye side two begins and our main character has slipped to the other side of sanitywith open arms then we have comfortably numbwell its just a great albummy favorite floyd album and one of my favorite all time albumsi try to listen to it at least once every couple of monthsback in high school its was at least once a week|1
i dont listen to a lot of soundtracks but after having this cd for a couple of weeks i absolutely love it ive listened to it many times  it has easily become one of my favorite cdsin my opinion two things set this cd apart first the performance is unmatched and you can feel the emotion and passion of the performer throughout the entire cd each song is very engaging and exquisitely communicates both the songs underlying emotions and the feelings of the pianist secondly the arrangements are fantastic they are very artistic and appropriate for the music yet also very unique and interesting without exception every track is wonderfully donei highly recommend this cd to everyone  you wont be disappointed|1
speed of light performances by the emerson quartet leave beethoven totally out of the musical picture  this is clearly not what beethoven had in mind  the more one listens to these performances the worse they become  the novelty of hearing such incredible technical ability wears off quite quickly  the set has some fine moments and the recorded sound is of excellent quality but none are worth the expense or agony of having to catch them as most of the music flies by  i deeply regret purchasing this set and will think twice before purchasing another emerson recording|0
i want to like this album i really do ive been listening to it getting ready for tour that starts 97 in manchester nh heres the thing i really like half the album and really hate the other half when i say hate i mean from a rush purist perspectiveive been with the band since the early days somebody turned me on to fly by night and then soon i was digging on everything ive embraced the bands shifting change in music loved the transition to the third leg of the rush movement counterparts presto rtb sai felt the mix was muddled the baseline is great but alex really doesnt come through well on the album i also feel the whole concept thing that this album speaks to was lost in the arrangementsclockwork angles caravan bu2b the wrecker wish them well  all thumbs up everything else thumbs down i said to my friend  longer term  this will be a dust collector in my rush collection|1
i bought the 1997 remaster and it sounds awful  very harsh and brittle and compressed if these sound engineers dont know what they are doing the buying public should not have to pay for their incompetence if a remastered remaster of a remaster comes out the original remaster should be recalled by the manufacturer as a defective product and replaced at no charge the only way they are going to stop making these multiple remasters is if it starts costing them money because money not music is the only thing they understand|0
this album is one of the most amazing albums ive ever experienced and it is a experience being semiautobiographical in content this albums shows how imaginative roger waters was in dealing with his fathers death  i would not say this is a upbeat album but none the less it is moving and how much of todays music can we say this about i would recommend also getting the movie of the same name because there are tracks on the album that are not in the movie and vice versa i am a big fan of lyrical content and this album has that and more so light a candle dim the lights and sit back and enjoy|1

im a long time van halen and satriani fan but i have to say that chickenfoot iii just seriously lacks orginality  i was most disappointed when i heard satrianis hard rock distorted menacing intro to big foot  unfortunately he never expands on this idea and the entire tune consists of one basic guitar riff  the lyrics sound like compiled washed up rehashes of classic rock and do nothing to appeal on any level  this basic pattern of limp wristed guitar and watered down lyrics is the main theme for this album and the band  i am extremely disappointed because satriani and hagar have incredible amounts of talent and have each made world class rock albums in years pastoverall it sounds like this band was the idea of big recording executives  it sounds like they kept a tight leash on satrianis playing and produced generic lyrics to appeal to noncritical pop listeners|0
before you listen to this forget who you are going to listen to relax and forget whatever you know about this bandas this is a concept album everyone will have there own interpratations of it i having not seen the movie will tell you minethe main carachter is born in the second song while the mother was pregnant the father had ran away the main charecter was normal physically but mentally he is insane as a teenager he has a girlfriend named vera after graduation he moves away and becomes a rock star he has women around him all the time and hundreds of guitars at the beggining of disc two he gives up on music and moves to a big city he stares at people through his apartment he basically goes completley insane he decides to make a comeback and has a big concert during the concert he starts yelling racial and sexual comments to those in the audience someone calls the police and he manages to sing two more songs before they drag him off stage they have a big trial and they all tell him to bring down the wall and he commits suicideof course i could be completely wrong buy it and see for yourself|1
the players play as if they were playing by themselves in their own little world totally unaware of the other parts the music crawls along with hardly an ounce of inspiration the total should be more than the sum of the parts and this isnt this adds support to my belief that jordi savall does not understand bach or german baroque music in general after listening to this recording hearing moroneys harpsichord recording provided a much needed relief from the hot humid air but the players individually are excellent|0
i saw the movie soon after high school and was duly impressed  the animation was spectacular  the movie was dark story concerning the growing emotional detachment and isolation of a rock star pink who gradually descends into a fantasy world of fascist leanings  perfect stuff for highschool i thought and a story that lent iself very well to the big screen  however even though pink floyd was one of my favorite bands since meddle i never bought the album  id heard it to death from my friends and though i was impressed at first i became less so with each subsequent listen  the wall has a lot of problems both in its scope and in its execution  as a larger work the concept is derivative of the pretty things far superior sf sorrow the first rock opera  the alienation of a boy who loses his father in wwii and his emotional breakdown  musically most of the songs with a few exceptions comfortably numb is among their best works seem to be filler they perhaps further the storyline but arent that compelling in fact many are dull  perhaps this has something to do with the fact that roger waters hogged the song writing and prevented rick wright from making any musical contribution what so ever which led to his leaving the group during the recording perhaps this has something to do with the over the top production of bob ezrin surely the most overrated producer on the planetpink floyd for me have since the syd barret days been primarily about the music which was often groundbreaking and moving  ive never given their lyrics as much weight although some were excellent but for me theyve always been secondary to the music  with the wall the lyrics are the main focus the music takes a backseat and the album suffers for it  there is a tremendous amount of filler music whose only purpose is to act as a backdrop to the lyricsstoryline  with some notable exceptions the music is either weak piano noodlings or overly theatrical bombast with little subtlety  which of course something that producer bob ezrin is known for  most importantly the wall just doesnt sound like pink floyd  after the wonderfully complex and even darker animals i expected more of the same sonic density but instead i got what is essentially a roger waters solo album with help from the other floydians and studio musiciansthe plot of the wall is unoriginal and just too long and ultimately boring  its just so much puerile poppsychology about building an emotional wall because school sucks dad died and mom is overprotective and then tearing the wall down who cares  the wall doesnt move me at all its story pretentions are too facile its music too showtune grandiose to move me in any significant emotional way  unlike previous pink floyd albums the wall sounds childish not childlike and less adult  its whiny self absorbed and worst of all maudlin  theres a silly and cinematic or theatrical drama to the whole thing that i find very unappealing and cartoonish  as a movie the wall was more successful because of the visual element and tremendous animation but as an album well  the music isnt very interesting its mostly filler and bombast and the storyline is just so much depressing and selfabsorbed navel gazing  just get over your pathetic rock star self rog  after the wall the floyd as far as i was concerned was over they never did anything that interesting again and roger waters solo career has been one bomb after another  the wall marks the death of pink floyd as a viable band  download it or rip it from a friend|0

i have been a longtime omen fan and i love all their albums up until the best of teeth of the hydra  this album sounded to me like an attempt to come back before they were ready and with a terrible vocalist to bootif you are new to omen i suggest the first three albums battle cry warning of danger and the curse or the best of if you can only choose one  the best of album is a pretty good example of the styles from each early album containing some of their best songs but not all the best onesi have not yet heard the newest album but it sounds like it might be a decent return to form based on reviews  i think it will be quite tough to replace jd kimball on vocals though|0
having come of age in the 80s i still list sam kinison as my favorite comedian  even so now with a family of my own i welcome comedy that i dont have to hide from my daughters or cringe when they overhear  brian regan is just such a comedian  if you love comedy based on language as opposed to stories observations etc then this album is also for you  and as a bonus your children can listen to it along with you with the strongest word used on the cd being hell|1
if youre a fan of anything live the beatles have done then this album is just right for you there are funny snipits of interviews and conversations theyve had with the bbc that will make you laugh there are also a couple of songs previously unheard like johns cover of memphis tn and pauls version of til there was you is actually better than the recorded album version on this takebut if i have this cd on my ipod i find myself skipping the majority of the songs because they just arent as good as their best work so this album is just okay for methe insert is great lots of pictures some previously not ever seen many taken at the bbc studiosif youre a diehard beatles fanatic then definitely buy if youre just starting out buy their other albums first before this one get to know their music first this is definitely not for the faint of heart |0

i have actually listened to some of this album i am not just saying this because of the title of the song i hate led zeppelin i would give this zero stars but i cant  if all they can think of is saying band members names and cussing them out they are not the best of musicians  plus they make fun of bonhams death how despicable can you get whos going to be around fifty years from now and whos not im fairly sure that nobodys going to care who screeching weasel is even five years from now led zeppelins surviving members are still making music how many fifty year olds are still making new music and getting playing time  not too many anybody who is in the least bit intelligent and likes creative music should not even consider buying this album|0

clockwork angels is truly one of rushs best albums probably my favorite since test for echo  this concept album truly is one that initially grabs you with its theme but only after you listen it a few times through do you really get a sense of the story and the messages that neil pearts masterful lyrics convey the album starts strongly with caravan a hardrocking song with nice movements that give you a preview that this is not your typical rush album  by the time you get to the catchy riffs of anarchist you cant help you but get very excited about whats coming next  the wreckers and wish them well are two of my favorite tracks both melodic but the strength is also in the lyrics and how they convey the emotions of confusion fear hope  the slower acoustic halo effect is an impressive track and you see the versatility of rush as they move right to the strong bass and guitars of cities of gold  the albums last track the garden at first struck me as not sounding like rush but the more i listened to it again the more i grew to embrace it  clearly that is the true experience of rush and clockwork angels it displays their unboundless creativity which pushes beyond traditional rushs fans comfort level and then makes you want more of what they continue to produce  i loved this album it told a story pulled me in and didnt let me go|1
if you are a pink floyd fan and you dont own the wall you shouldnt be aloud to be a fan this album tells a story of a mans life through a tough childhood and a depressing adulthood this album has songs from singing about his mother to songs speaking of young lust songs about being comfortably numb to having to tun like hell the album is filled with epic melodic songs to having depressing songs with distored guitar and evil lyrics my personal favorites on this album are another brick in the wallall of them mother goodbye blue sky young lust hey you comfortably numb run like hell are my favorites but if buying this epic of an album i suggest you do not listen to it all at one time it is a hazard to your health if listening to pink floyd to long and you slip into your own little coma than please consult parametics it is better to listen in sections they need to put a warning label on it but anyway this is the greatest album of the 70s if you enjoy the album then see the movie of course that probably has a higher health risk than the album due to that u see they trauma that the man goes through as well as hearing it get this albumsorry for my poor grammer in this i didnt review|1

the twelve pieces for various solo instruments and chamber orchestra bearing the simple titles concerto no 112 that vagn holmboe wrote between 1939 and 1950 are key works in the danish composers development consolidating a neoclassical style with the slighest of influences from other modernist trends the inspiration of sibelius and the metamorphosis technique are not yet in evidence but holmboe had already established a careful balance in his music and a very distinctive approach to orchestrationthis disc from 1996 was the first volume in dacapos complete cycle of these concertos hannu koivula leads the danish radio concert orchestra with soloists anne land piano mikkel futtrup violin eva stergaard flute and niels thomsen clarinetthe concerto no 1 op 17 for piano strings and timpani 1939 loudly proclaims that holmboe has discovered bartoacuteks music and loves it as it opens the strings play achingly beautiful triadic harmonies the pianist enters and produces very different material percussive and brash with a lot of spiky wrong notes for the whole first movement these two forces sweet strings and bold piano alternate the second movement much shorter is molto allegro and here the strings timpani and piano are more tightly integrated in a common musical line between majorkey punctuations from string and timpani the pianist plays ascending and descending runs with lots of spiky wrong notesthe other two concertos are much more traditionally neoclassical the concerto no 2 op 20 1940 is a double concerto for violin flute strings and percussion it is in four movements allegro con brio  vivace  adaio  allegro molto of which the middle two are labelled intermezzos 1  2 here orchestral pomp alternates with long melodies witty or poignant from the soloist the violinist gets a brief cadenza in the last movement in the concerto no 3 op 21 for clarinet strings and brass 194042 the soloist mainly plays variations on the same caprioling theme its a convivial little work and its hard to believe this was written during wartimeunfortunately the dacapo recordings of the chamber concertos are not very good the danish radio concert orchestra is a pops orchestra the soloists are not especially distinguished hannu koivula is an uninspired conductor of this material and the sound quality is flat in every way the dacapo recordings suffer in comparison with the inprogress abandoned cycle on bis where owain arwel hughes leads the aalborg symphony orchestra and worldclass soloists concertos no 1 and 3 can be found together onone bis discwith other fine works hear them thereas long as the bis cycle remains incomplete committed holmboe fans will probably end up getting this anyway since it is the only extant recording of the concerto no 2 but still not a good place to hear the material for the first time|0

the long awaited new rush album is finally here as promised on june 12 a date that became indelible in the hearts of all rush fans clockwork angles was a title that teased rushaholics for a long time since the release of the first single caravan the picture sleeve of the single depicted the intricate decorative clock and i had thought this would be the cover of the album however the cover design was released and i could not help but feel a twinge of disappointment that it was such a simple design having been used to some more dynamic art on previous album covers over the years i have since grown used to seeing that iconic red cover with the medieval clock in the swirling turbulent clouds the simplistic design is memorable and indeed all the artwork in the booklet is incredibly provocative capturing a steampunk future with dreamy scapes and structures illustrated by hugh syme there are some breathtaking designs including a spacey look at a blue world with clouds and that giant clock ticking ominously above some of the art reminds me of the future fantasy worlds of myst such as the beige colour painting of art deco sailing ships in the air over an enormous clock face and there are details of steam emanating from the wheels and cogs of progress it is a place of dreams and fantasies with characters wandering around such as the peddler in a darkened forest there is a shipwreck graveyard in stormy seas two hands reaching for a mystical clock object sun dials mysterious enchanted worlds and the everpresent watchmaker icons  beautifully realised the art captures the feel of the album and transports us into the world of the protagonists journeythe musicianship is brilliant on this album peart has stated in interviews that he intended it to be my highest achievement lyrically and drumming wise  he further went on to say that he took a new approach to writing and recording i played through each song just a few times on my own checking out patterns and fills that might work then he called on nick who became his conductor and i was his orchestra peart would attack the drums in order to respond to his enthusiasm and his suggestions between takes and together we would hammer out the basic architecture of the part with halftime bridges and doubletime outros therefore there was no need for counting or endless repetitionthe concept is strong and takes some comprehensive power to interpret it but the liner notes clearly outline a very intricate and compelling tale that is also told within pearts thoughtful lyrics the concept is based on the work of pearts friend science fiction novelist extraordinaire kevin j anderson who announced that he would write the clockwork angels novel and he related many of the concepts of the novel involving the forces of order and chaos that inflict themselves upon a young traveller who dreams of travelling to a steampunk alchemist world of hidden cities it is a world of piracy carnivalesque settings and colourful characters such as the watchmaker who imposes precision on the lives of the inhabitants and  the evil anarchist who desires that precision to be turned to chaosthe tale that has made its way onto this album is concentric around a farm boy who had an idyllic lifestyle with peace and stability but it became too much to take and ultimately stifled his dreams of exploring what the world offers it is set in the village of barrel arbor where steamliners descend onto the rails on their way to the winding pinion river to crown city as the farmer watched these massive machines he longs to escape to live out his dreamsthis is where caravan comes in and after hearing it out of context for so long as the first single unleashed upon the world it is so refreshing to hear it finally as the opener on the album  from the first time i heard it i was very taken with the song as it is a heavier rush than that of recent years and it sounded vibrant and dynamic with very thought provoking lyrics and excellent musicianship it begins with atmospheric clanging bells and the sound of machines moving across the hemispheres the familiar guitar sound of alex lifeson cranks up with that powerdriving riff then neil peart races around his drum kit then maintains a steady rhythmic figure until a bassline begins followed by the golden tones of geddy lee this is rush the production and mixing of nick raskulinecz is exceptional capturing a crystalline sound with all musicians audible including the orchestrations  the melody of the song is certainly infectious especially the way the chorus builds to the mantra of the album i cant stop thinking big the interlude is grinding guitar and some accomplished fret work a low key synth drone is heard in the background the choppy time sig is repeated until a lead break with some incredible string bends to lift up the sound and then back to the chorus the structure is effective and it is a great way to open proceedings it is easy to be accustomed to the standard of excellence that rush maintain from album to album but occasionally an album simply stands out as being above the rest simply due to strong songwriting and powerful melodies that jam themselves into the brain clockwork angels certainly qualifies in this regarda transition is heard leading into bu2b another song not unknown as it was the b side of the single but the new intro was a nice touch with reverb vocals and mystical undertones it was never a song i was immediately taken with as a b side but on the album it makes more sense and tells the story admirably that introduces the watchmaker who is integral to the concept this figure ruled from crown city through the regulators and the alchemistpriests had provided coldfire in order for the power and light of this world to be possiblebu2b brought up to believe concerns the whole concept of belief as a human condition the universe as a plan we are only human its not ours to understand the protagonist is expressing that the world in which he exists always has told the occupants to believe in what were told until our final breath while our loving watchmaker loves us all to deathclockwork angels is where the album becomes more than just great as this is one of the most progressive songs from rush for years it is little wonder that lifeson referred to it as an epic song very dynamic and a multiparted piece roadrunnerrecordscomit begins with a gregorian monk chant setting the scene and then a hovering synth and loud crashing guitars explode the percussion builds up and it breaks to a pleasant clean guitar phrase and lees vocals he sounds excellent and at times uses multi tracking on his vocals to enhance the tones the bassline is pulsating along the metrical patterns of peart the lyrics follow the deepening storyline that moves to the bustling city of chronos square where the farmboy finds himself gazing in wonder at the huge formations of the cathedral of the timekeepers massive  sky towers and the radiant angels of land sea sky  and light with the iridescent  floating globes it is a surreal scene that is captured brilliantly in the artwork the song is compelling with some dynamic time sig changes and mood shifts it builds with many variations on the main themes until the outbreak of the instrumental that is a hammering riffthe synchronised and graceful clockwork angels are the creatures that promise every treasure to the foolish and the wise goddesses of mystery spirits in disguise every pleasure we bow and close our eyes clockwork angels promise every prize  there is a biblical pretext based on proverbs 35 lean not upon your own understanding the people of this fantastical land worship  and adore the angels and celestial spiritual machinery the song ends with a quiet whisper and it has been quite a journey with some complex structures with rush at the top of their gamethe anarchist follows with a terrific guitar riff and heavy rhythms lees vocals are more forced and are full of conviction with some moments that sound processed like a robotic announcer on a pa system his register is high on verses such as in all your science of the mind seeking blind through flesh and bone find the blood inside this stone what i know ive never shown what i feel ive always known i plan my vengeance on my own and i was always alone again it is a heavy song with a ton of distortion and loud musical soundscape the interlude is a wonderful lead break with phase effects on guitar that soars heavenly it is as good as anything i have heard on the best tracks of recent rush albums it definitely has a modern sound unlike the 70s years the lyrics are from the point of view of the anarchist who shuns the optimistic cry of the pedlar what do you like to which he replies vengeancethe plot thickens and the next song the carnies augments the atmospheres with a strange intro of carnival sounds and distant voices the amazing riff locks in and opens one of the metal tracks of the album it feels heavier with the metal distortion and then the next section breaks into an electronic spacey soundscape it is certainly one of the highlights of the album but none of the songs thus far have been less than excellent respectively it may be one of the strongest first halves of a rush album since moving pictures and counterparts the lead solo is again absolutely virtuoso as only lifeson can be with a different sound but an appropriate feeling to the steampunk theme this song really grew on me and i love the melody and the overall chord structure and especially the heavy riffing throughoutthe concept was inspired by peart who was reading about circus settings in robertson davies novels the story continues that the farmer finds work at a carnival beneath the ever watching angels where bodies spin in a clockwork dance the smell of flint and steel a wheel of fate a game of chance  he sees the anarchist holding a clockwork detonator and he hurls it but the farmboy catches it just in time saving all the onlookers at the carnival however the ticking box in the hand of the innocent causes the angry crowd to move toward him with bad intenthalo effect is the first time the band are able to settle into a serene tranquil atmosphere an angelic howl and wind blowing lead to acoustics and gentle vocals that whisper on the wind lee sounds flawless and emotional on this ballad that has really grown on me finally it builds like a power ballad but this is not closer to the heart the sound is modernist and has a heartfelt feeling the sound reflects the story that involves the protagonist falling in love with a carnival performer acrobat dancer he pursues her and then after a fling she rejects and holds contempt towards him it is an illusionary lover a goddess with wings on her heels but the real girl was not the ideal that i wanted to see the song is very thoughtful and has a lovely melodic style the dreaminess of the song works well to break up the intensity of previous heavier tracks i look forward to hearing this song now on every listenseven cities of gold is another masterful track opening with powerful bassline and dark lead guitar string bends that echo and slice with serrations on a knife edge the working man style riff soon cranks up that drives this powerhouse track the riff reminds me of vintage 70s rush which is a sheer delight it has a sensational chorus that builds with innovative chord changes the time sig even has a progressive feel that skips a beat here and there the lead solo is more of the guitar serrations and high pitched string bends that add to an ominous atmosphere it has an infectious melody and again is one that is bound to grow on the listenerpeart explains id read a lot of history from the southwestern part of the us and that figured into the story of the explorer coronado who kept going out into the desert to find the fabled cities of gold classic rock the plot of the album gets into the historical legendary story that fascinates the protagonist the legend is that there was a land hiding the seven cities of gold and the only way to them was on the steamliners across the western sea the protagonist bravely crossed to poseidon a port city to work on the steamliners serving the alchemy mines and onto redrock desert with its stone monuments the traveller eventually set out on a quest to find the infamous city of gold cibola these legends were part of the mans dreams as the lyrics tell glowing in my dreams like hallucinations glitter in the sun like a revelation distant as a comet or a constellationthe lyrics of this song are superb with mystical imagery such as the desolate landscapes of the fantasy world canyons and cactus endless and trackless searching through grim eternity sculptured by prehistoric sea overall a wonderful track with esoteric imagery conjuring up the rushian scapes and mystique of 2112 where any minute one might expect to see the priests of the temples of syrinx turn up on the scene dare i say that this is one of the most brilliant tracks of rush for decadesthe wreckers was once one of the weaker efforts of the album though i always thought still had a nice rocking energy it was not initially as captivating as the other songs thus far so it was one of the more pedestrian songs for me even after many listens however this too grew on me eventually and after my 9th listen i finally succumbed to its wonderful chorus melodies and sweeping orchestrations the storyline is more compelling though concerning a narrow escape from the frozen dessert with the protagonist making his way half dead to poseidon aboard a ship a storm breaks out but a beacon of light helps navigate them from danger a ghostly light appears through the driving rain salvation in human chain unfortunately the signal is false to lure seafarers to crash on the rocks once the wreck occurred the crew would be plundered of their cargo these were the wreckers peart explains his inspiration the wreckers was actually from daphne du maurier thats been in my mind for 30 years i guess its an episode in jamaica inn so all of that coalesced into the character and the history of the story the whole conceptthe lyrics state the warning in a cryptic manner all i know is that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be true all i know is that sometimes the truth is contrary everything in life you thought you knew of course if you were unaware of the concept story you could interpret these words as part of coping with the trials of life something that peart is very familiar with having lost his wife and daughter in recent times in the same yearthe next track is an instant masterpiece one that i have heard many times prior to this release being the second and far more superior single of the album headlong flight has a glorious riff and melodic line lees wandering bassline is outstanding and the percussion is peart at his most frenetic as he chases his cymbals and skins around like a maniac the main riff is lifted from the glory of bastille day and that has caused some controversy among fans but for me there is nothing wrong with returning to the vintage sound if it works and is reinvented to provide something very special peart has actually stated that he hopes that song will be in their setlist for live performances indefinitely what was it that oscar wilde said selfplagiarism is style he believes that we certainly do a few tongueincheek nods to bastille day in headlong flight  thats deliberate so when we fans recognise it that is a compliment to the band who want us to do precisely thatthe speed of the track is quite breathtaking and lee sounds absolutely full of passion and drive all the journeys of this great adventure it didnt always feel that way i wouldnt trade them because i made them the best i could and thats enough to say the song builds to the chorus that changes time sig into a beautiful melodic moderate feel as soon as i heard the melody of the chorus and the lyrics i was mesmirised as chills went down the spine when lee sings i have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels steered the airship right across the stars i learned to fight i learned to love i learned to feel oh i wish that i could live it all again amidst that fantastic melody hides a story of airships turning cogs and wheels and machinery that now makes perfect sense amidst the rest of the conceptual material the song has even more power on the album and comes in at the perfect moment when things were beginning to become too easy on the ears the frenetic pace and intensity of this track makes this stand out as a magical moment of the album the way the song changes seamlessly from a fast tempo to the half time feel is a master touch this is rush at their most adventurous and heaviest after a long hiatus and 20 albums the lyrics are poetic beauty put to music that resonate so powerfully in my spiritlees high register vocals are everpresent and he has not sounded this good for years in the half time section there is an instrumental that has some fast peart drum fills and deliciously delirious axework from lifeson the band are in full flight and one can tell they are enjoying their golden years rocking as hard as ever you have to be inspired by their energy and commitment to excel lifeson incorporates wahwah pedals with hyper fast picking and is like a tiger loosed from its cage a far cry from his lead work on the past few albumsthe words could be taken in any way you want outside of the actual storyline some days were dark i wish that i could live it all again some nights were bright i wish that i could live it all again the highs and lows of life are captured perfectly here in context of the album the protagonist is thinking over all the great adventures and es the great alchemist friedrich gruber i wish i could do it all again he has steered the great airships across the stars and travelled to cities of gold so he fondly remembers the adventures without regrets one of the most optimistic moments of the albumthe pedlar returns and asks what do you lack again and the protagonist considers how he was brought up to believe and no philosophy consoles me in a clockwork universe the tone turns to a pessimism with the man pondering over the pedlars words so he loses faith in higher powers remembers the pain dwells on the illusion of love he holds onto the belief that love conquers over all the rejection of the past because that is the way he was brought up to believe this song is a melancholy short passage of orchestral music consisting of symphonic strings conducted by david campbell the strings have also appeared on halo effect the anarchist and the wreckers but on bu2b2 they are prominent and quite daring the lyrics are downbeat and gloomy belief has failed me now the bright glow of optimism has failed me somehow life goes from bad to worse this may not appeal to many it is easily the worst track of the album but as a diversion for the album as a whole it works and i count it as more of a transition into the next masterful track if taken out of context this track is a morbid downbeat filler but i still love the way it transforms the atmosphere after the bright vibrant uptempo rock of previous tracks it is the diversity that makes the impact rather than taken on its own this is a veritable fish out of water but the album would not be complete without these oddball moments and transitionswish them well is another outstanding track that grabbed me the first time i heard it the loud guitar and pounding drum is augmented by very melodic vocals that are back to a more hopeful resonance all that you can do is wish them well the hook is catchy and it leads to some wonderful verses i especially love the multi tracked harmonies on the section thank your stars youre not that way turn your back and walk away dont even pause and ask them why turn around and say goodbye i grew to love this song over a few listens it just jumps out at me and prepares for the epic to end the album the lead break is stellar playing with emotive bending speed picking and arpeggios there is a strong harmony in the refrain too and the words impact my spirit the ones whove done you wrong the ones who pretended to be so strong the grudges youve held for so long its not worth singing that same sad song this is about dealing with our demons that is essential to our wellbeing and rush have a lot to say about how we must learn to move on even when we are going through trials just wish them wellin context of the storyline the protagonist has come to terms with his life even after feeling victimised and defeated he reasons that it is not worth holding grudges as it is just burning him up like coals on his heart the best response is to avoid the ones that hurt him and simply wish them well now i can relate to this in my own personal journey peart has really hit the nail on the head here and it is spiritually uplifting to hear this song with these thoughts in mind i have seen how people have become scarred over the words of others and hurtful actions and it is all because they hold onto grudges and refuse to let go it is only when we choose to let go that we can truly be free from condemnation and the curse of rejection it is a choice and if we remember that we can choose to not allow the defamation of others to scar our character thank you rush for reminding us of these valuable important lessonsthe lessons continue and culminate in the next wonderful epic song the garden it begins with tranquil beautiful acoustics and a violin and ends with a sweeping majestic orchestral soundscape and soaring melodies that are soothing to the soul the music includes a gorgeous piano interlude by jason sniderman the lyrics are some of rushs most powerful and uplifting to the spirit  the protagonist muses on his life and finds that ray of hope he had been searching for the measure of a life is a measure of love and respect so hard to earn so easily burned in the fullness of time a garden to nurture and protect the hopeful lyrics are reflected in the way that the music builds to a crescendo and it really feels like the ending of an epic journey there is a sadness in the atmosphere but it is a relaxing beautiful mood generated there is a hint of remorse that the journey is over but the protagonist who has experienced a bildungsroman quest has learnt all the valuable lessons of life and nothing more needs to be said his life is complete having learned that the measure of love and respect is integral the arrow flies while you breathe the hours tick away the cells tick away the watchmaker has time up his sleeve continues the lyrics stating the case for all of us who only have so much time in which to make life count so we must make the most of it before time runs out these are simplistic ideas but they are conveyed with poetic resonance and it all ends on this ray of hope the future disappears into memory with only a moment between forever dwells in that moment hope is what remains to be seen the album concludes on this hope with sweeping symphonic soundscapes that pour out of the speakers embedding the album upon our consciousthis is an unforgettable album that took some time to grow on me but once it became engrained in my spirit i was totally captivated under its powerful hold it could easily pass by without fanfare on a casual listen by the average music listener disinterested in understanding the concept or the lyrics furthermore if one does not relate to the lyrics and interprets them as just some fantasy world out of reach it is possible that this could become rather incomprehensible the lyrics are deep perhaps as deep as anything peart has written but he has a lot to say about the emotional rollercoaster of existence faith love respect freedom resilience defeat and the purpose of our lives none of this comes off as convoluted or pretentious in any way there is a definite conviction in this work and it is trying to say something important to us that we can take with us into our own circumstances the music itself is a mesmirising virtuoso augmentation and this is embellished with symphony orchestra strings and ethereal atmospherics it transports us directly into the fantasy worlds and becomes a full sensory experience aurally with the music and visually tangible thanks to the artwork liner notes with story lines and of course the lyricsin conclusion this is rush back to their absolute best after some rather forgettable albums and straight forward rock releases clockwork angels is almost the perfect concept album where everything works to become a coherent whole with masterful song structures and music literally dripping with innovation it has been a long time since i have heard a masterpiece album from rush i would have to go back to 1981s moving pictures to find a 5 star album in my opinion however folks finally rush have produced a masterpiece with their new inimitable mature sound it is far superior to anything from the catalogue of albums from 1985  1991 it is marginally better than counterparts that had a weaker second half after a brilliant first half the difference with clockwork angels is that the whole album is consistent in terms of strong musicianship and infectious melodies with powerhouse lyrical content and that is not something i can say for the rather patchy material of test for echo or vapor trails and again it is better than snakes and arrows that had some ordinary tracks marring an otherwise excellent album to state that this new album measures up to the glory days of a farewell to kings hemispheres permanent waves or moving pictures is perhaps stretching the credibility too far however this is still the best rush album for decades and deserves accolades and high recommendation therefore ultimately a masterpiece status for all the reasons stated i did not expect it to stand up to my rather high expectations we rush fans are rather demanding but i am absolutely delighted to announce that this album is a tour de force that lives up to the hype and is an exceptional treasure from start to end so far i hail it as album of the year|1
michael w smiths second venture was a runaway hit when it was first released over 20 years ago  it was in fact the first album of his i ever heard  what i like best about this cd is that the music is really not all that dated  sure theres plenty of 80sstyle synthsizer sound on here but its never overboard  this album was for the most part michael w smiths own creative soundthe songs are very uplifting and not too rock n rollish  this album has appeal for general audiences not just the youth group ages but everyone  therefore its appeal is timeless  and i highly recommend it|1
it looks like the other reviews for this cd are reviews for the conductor and the performance rather than the material itself  my review is for the material itself  although the disc that i am reviewing is this solticso version i have only listened to a few other versions and have not studied the differences closely enough to be qualified to say how this version compares to other versionshowever i have always loved the classics so i feel that i am definitely qualified to express my opinion regarding the musical ideas on this disc  the bottom line is that this is really bad music  there is only one good song on the whole disc track 2 titled scene by the brook  i will admit that track 2 is awesome which is why im giving this disc 2 stars instead of 1 star  but the rest of the disc is just plain boringi have a few beethoven discs in my collection  and it seems to me that hes about as overrated as any composer  of course beethoven has a handful of great songs that everybody loves such as moonlight sonata and fur elise  but his great material could easily be contained in one double disc setif you are just getting into the classics i would definitely pass on this one and on beethoven in general except for maybe a best of beethoven set  instead i recommend artists like chopin scriabin erik satie john cage the beatles syd barrett and david bowie|0
disclosure im one of those rush fans that has enjoyed all of their albums even the lighter almost jazzlike offerings ive enjoyed dropping the needle on each new album wondering what it would sound likethat said most of us longtime rush fans became fans around if not exactly 2112 those earlier albums defined the rush sound that polarized music fans for those of us who loved it we fell hard we ate up farwell to kings permanent waves 2112 and even caress of steel which polarizes even rush fansclockwork angel is a return to those earlier albums this album flat out rocks if fact most of these tracks would not be out of place in the thrash metal category for me it belongs square in the classic rush sound progrock categorygrade a|1
i must admit that i was raised on rush along with other intellectually challenging minds such as pink floyd erwin schroumldinger george orwell leonardo da vinci nikola tesla robert frost arthur c clarke friedrich nietzsche sigmund freud albert einstein john f kennedy and winston churchill among many many others  you get the picture  my intellectual upbringing if not eclectic was diverse as it was challenging  it was rush who enabled me broadened my horizons always leaving me for want of more no matter how it was presented  in the absence of rush and their influence in my life from the moment at the age of nine i first studied 2112 in 1976  it was introduced to me quite accidentally when i saw the vinyl album sitting on my uncles bed that memorable year  at first i didnt understand the 2112 side a portion of it but after weeks its dark and hopeful narrative was more meaningful more foreboding than anything i had ever watched or read up two that time  of course the second side proved quite entertaining to a naive but relatively intelligent young man  and no i had no concept of drugs per se  i was quite content to listen passage to bangkok and take away an exotic train voyage through a wondrous far eastern country  though i did often wonder what that stuff was that i could often smell emanating from my uncles room  oddly that same smell seems to permeate whatever venue at which rush plays when im in attendance  very strange  coinidence perhaps  how times changethat aside without the epic story of 2112 such complexity may never have invigorated my mind the way it magically occured  i may never have took it upon myself to study some of the great works of the influential people i mention at the beginning of this review  if you are still reading this and you get it you are probably wondering why i havent mentioned the supposed 20th century philosopher ayn rand to whom the 2112 opus is practically dedicated  truthbetold the fountainhead was among the first book i read after absorbing the 2112 saga  i found that book for lack of better terms pretentious overlycomplex and written with a clear social agenda then again i could have been a wee young for such philosophical concepts  though neil peart the bands virtuoso drummer and lyricist may be a fan of her work it was and still is clear that he extracted some admittedly pertinent and valid social commentary found in the pages of rands works and allowed those to not only influence 2112 but many of his later efforts primarily the enlightenment of an individual who then takeson the typically orwellian or totalitarian powerelite  in my personal intellectual voyage when it comes to rush mr pearts occasional brushing with this theme throughout the years always brings a smile to my face  im uncertain as to whetherornot rush influenced my life to the extent that this review which has yet to mention clockwork angels1 might signify but i grewup a subjective term as my wife and children say i have yet to to become a systems engineer serving in the united states army as such serve as an adjunct professor at campbell university earn a graduate degree write seven volumes of poetry one of which is still in print and available on amazon and one casting shadows due to be published this summer one textbook the extracted mba still in print and on amazon among other interests  this begs the question are my published works of poetry akin to me serving as a neil peart lyrical cover band  i would categorically say no  if you have read me drone on this far send me a note to castingshadowsbook at gmailcom and i will send you a free ecopy of vapours of promise so you may serve as judge jury and gulp executioner as a lifelong fan of rush a group that defies classification into any known genre it was with the greatest of anticipation that i awaited receipt of their latest work clockwork angels  i had the pleasure of reading much in the press regarding this forthcoming release all almost ubiquitously positive  the three songs rush released caravan bu2b and headlong flight whetted my appetite to say the least  when i heard confirmation it was going to be a bonafide concept album i was simply floored  after all this time the old men were going to release a fullon concept album  what struck me further was the fact they has said at one point many years ago that they would never release such an album again  not to belabor a point but they also said they would never release an album like the masterful moving pictures again  to them i say there are plenty of years left in you three gentlemen  when caravan and bu2b were released in 2010 i along with thousands of fans were thrilled  these two songs showed us collectively that rush was not only still firing on all cylinders but that the rush engine was fully tuned and capable of maximum horsepower at some parts it seems like clockwork angels is on turbo  thankfully my ipod had no moving parts for surely they would have quickly worndown as i played these songs over and over adnauseum  i finally came to my senses and mixed the songs with their other great works but still  then just a couple of months ago rush released headlong flight upping the ante over the first two songs released for this album  and what a song headlong flight is  interestingly even armed with the knowledge that clockwork angels was to be a concept album i could draw no logical correlation between the three songs lyrically  each was magnificent on its own  one would assume that a song released from the latter part of the album would have little contextual meaning but there it was  son number nine headlong flight standing out on its own perfectly well on all levels  i now believe that was rushs point  i was however wary  granted two years is a long time to allow us to suckle on the fruits of an upcoming album how many of us have been a tad disappointed in the last 20 years or so when rush releases a song or few prior to an albums release only to find they were usually the meatandpotatoes of the album itselffriends after a thorough several listens of clockwork angels i am here to report that we have entered an entirely new phase in the nearly 40year career of rush  more significant than the transition between 2112 and a farewell to kings  even more significant than the interesting and controversial transition between moving pictures and signals  what we have before us is like nothing else rush or any band i know of has ever accomplished  from the first clatter of the steam train on caravan through the gentle probing thoughts of the garden clockwork angels is infact an engrossing concept album that spends well its 66 minutes telling the tales adventures and misadventures of a protagonist in the steampunk tradition where technology has advanced as an alternate history that minimizes or eliminates electric or electronic development sorry mr gordon moore and your coveted moores law that gave us the world as we know today and a career for the likes of me no less  neil pearts lyrics tell this remarkable and adventurous story while geddy lee and alex lifeson craft music around them in a manner that seems almost superhuman  never in my threedecadeplus of listeningto and analyzing their music have rush in my opinion produced such a polished complex profound meaningful and most importantly integrated piece of work as this  ever  the only song i can think of that illustrates when i mean wasnt even a full song  it was la villa strangiato off the hemispheres album which was ironically their last true concept album  the diversity of music and lyrical ambiguity except bu2b2 indeed conspire to enable each and every song to stand on its own if need be  even more fascinating and i dont know if this is intentional i find the more i listen to clockwork angels it gets progressively pardon the pun better from beginning to end  that alone is mindblowing to me as i have never seen them or anyone do it on any of their albums the original rush album had elements of this but i suppose most of us discount much prepeart rush  i have always found myself enamored with what we old farts called side a but clockwork angels gives and keeps giving like an old steam train lurching from rest and chugging its way to cruising speed headed for the garden pulling forty years and hundredsofthousands of us along for the ride  i love caravan  but caravan is just pulling out of the station  if your steam train doesnt have seat belts i suggest you grab something sturdythe ride has just beguncongratulations geddy alex and neil|1
the first composition starts with a cheap imitation of the wellknown bach toccata  the socalled fugato section is inconsequential  if that is the extent of nanes contrapuntal skills i feel sorry for himthe slow movement consists of a melody in one hand with arpeggios in the other hand just like his nocturnes  that must be his only way of composing slow movements  he overuses the variation form probably because that is an easy form to improvise  there are a few interesting special effects but he dwells on those special effects long after they lose their noveltyin the first movement of the socalled etude he strikes random discords to show us that he is a modern composer  in the espressivo movement of this composition he once again falls into his celestial nocturne rutif you take a poll you may find that my estimation of richard nanes is a majority view  an announcer for a classical radio station informed me that nanes name is a big joke among classical radio stations  he finances his selfpromotion with a family inheritance but it does little good  when this particular radio announcer receives unsolicited cds from nanes he gives them away as contest promotions only to find them on the racks at the used cd store the following week|0
i have quite a few nhop cds and this one does not do it for me it tries too hard to be clever original and ends up sounding  pretentious some tracks have a choir in the background as well as violins and a cello and all up  i only wish that the great palle mikkelborg had played some actual jazz with his trumpet there are much better examples of nhop and look for the reviews before you choose|0
i am a great admirer of the music by the late eduardo mata and the dallas symphony i have heard wonderful prokofiev ibert and stravinsky from this pairingi cannot extend that admiration to this justifiably withdrawn production however to state it as simply as possible the approach maestro mata adopted to the monumental leningrad symphony is just too pretty he tries to make beautiful music out of a score that represents the heroism of russians under attack by both hitler and stalinthere is little reason for you to approach this cd unless you want to hear an inappropriate performance of this music the dallas players do their best but the direction is simply wrong|0
essential for any rush fan especially if you are more of a fan of their classic material  i believe this album reflects their entire career to this point and indicates their best may be yet to come  not a weak song on the record and some of the best jamming in years  id give it more stars if i could|1
i purchased this for my niece since she lives in germany and i wanted her to have some american children songs to listen to  my brother and i enjoyed listening to songs of our childhood and sharing them with her|1
all in all this a tremendously ugly album the music much of it ranging from morosesomber to angry and frustrated is a perfect background for the poetic story of roger waters semifictional character a character based loosely on his own feelings about growing up without a father wwii and partially on syd barrett the bands original front man the wall is a fascinating and artful interpretation of what happens to a generation robbed of strong father figures this album is one of the darkest pieces of popular music ever written and undoubtedly will go down in the annals of musical history as a unique masterpiece|1
this is one of the rare dissappointments by chente  i recommend the original recordings by jorge negrete or more recent recordings by alberto angel el cuervo|0
got this cd for a roadtrip we were laughing nonstop the entire time even the 2nd and 3rd times ive listened through this it has been hilarious  highly recommended|1
and thats the only exception to this soundtrack i bought it in 1998 and i swear ive listened to it only twice it really is that boring the only kind of music we get is that to match the hijinks onscreen randy edelman just doesnt bring his own unique angle to the picture at all some of the lighthearted music is good enough to stand on its own but its hardly worth buying the cd for and it doesnt make for a worthy scorewhats totally weird is that much of it sounds exactly like his score for dragonheart a score that was infinitely superior to this novice entry most of the cues are so basic and without any kind of clout the bad guy theme is so obvious without being menacing the love theme is too sugary and feels tacky and false and the rest is just fillera couple of comic tracks have some wacky takes on certain themes but there is still no reason to buy this cd i bought it in hope that the crazy music played during the scene where ipkiss puts on the mask for the first time was included now that was cool but its not on the cd nothing of interest is buydragonheart original motion picture soundtrackif you want a decent or great edelman score|0
a heads up  the 2010 hallmark label release is awful crappy sound quality i had to throw it away and buy a copy of the 1990 sony release instead which i would rate 5 stars|0
i bought this cd on a whim while browsing the up and coming section at target  i bought it along with blue october  what i dont understand is why blue october is getting more radio time theyre just ok to me  flyleaf is an intense vocal wide range of emotional color that exudes a venting panorama  theres the heavy riffs and sizzling drums in the background that vibes so well with lacey moseleys wide ranging beautifully melodic vocals  but she also has this passion and intensity that blends so well with the heavy rock feel  ive always enjoyed a melodic female voice mixed with heavy rockpop soundsi can definitely hear a similarity in vocals to avril lavigne sorta has a little bit of letters to cleo kay hanley a little bit like lacuna coil but i was a little bit disappointed with lacuna because the vocals arent as wide ranging and intense for lacuna  i love the way lacey goes so intensely melodic and then rumbles a little roarscream like shes venting all of her energyi wish i could find more bands like this one  i hope to check out more of the bands that are shown who also buy this album and see if theyre similar  lacuna is ok not great but flyleaf rocks  i love the first track im so sick i love to blast it in my car or on my mp3 at work when i feel like venting  you cant beat having music that you can really feel|1
much praise has been given this collection and im at a loss as to why  the recorded sound as well as the performances themselves are dismal  if you dont mind tape hiss noticeable splices etc then by all means buy  this set  however i would recommend the set by jeno jando on naxos  besides the clarity of the recording he actually puts his heart into the  playing|0
the wall is in my humble opinion the greatest rock album after paranoid by black sabbath and led zeppelins fourth albumthis contains my favourite songs like another brick in the wall and comfortably numbhugely recommended|1

im a long time freddie king fan i saw him in houston in the 70s this album looks professional but does not tell you or prepare you for whats inside  its another homemade bootleg 3rd row tape job or a terrible sound board recording i cant listen to it these are all live recordings of many of freddies classics pass on this rip off|0

this is titled indian cafe pure indian lounge it is hip hop music pure do do do not order this if you like veena as there is no veena on it and the company expects me to pay for postage and give me a creditcredit for what how could i ever trust them to order from them again|0
first i want to point out that the 4 stars i give this album represent my view of its standing in comparison to other rush albums not how good i think it is in general  since in 40 years rush hasnt put out a bad album or even a bad song the 4 stars here would surpass mostg other albums 5 stars  i would also like to point out that i am not a rabid rush fan  if you are a rabid or perhaps even a moderately afflicted rush fan you may not initially be suitably impressed  you mostly likely will not feel let down but you may not be inclined to sing its praises either  but give it time  the reason a rabid rush fan may not fully embrace the album initially is the same reason non rush fans or non rabid rush fans will enjoy it more than other rush albums  it sounds more basic than anything rush has previously done although thats kind of like saying the new ferrari isnt as fast as the previous version  on this album the songs are not of epic length the time changes and polyphonic rhythms of neils drumming the pedal work of alexs playing and the frenetic leadlike bass playing of geddy are not so in your face as earlier rush albums  so if you give this ablum a oncethrough or a casual listen you may find it less inspired than what you would expect from rush  if thats the case dont stop there listen again and again each listen reveals a greater complexity a greater maturity than the last listen  once you do that you will realize it is infused with all the elements that make rush great  this isnt pop music after all it demands your attention and will reward you nicely for your efforts  one other point  most reviews refer to the album as a concept album  alex however has reportedly been adamant in insisting it isnt  the divergence is understandable  lyrically the album clearly is telling a story in fact a book will be coming out based on the story on the album  and there is some reprises too  but unlike say tommy each song also stands alone each song is a story in itself like each episode of mash was a complete story but mash taken as a whole was also the story of the experiences of a medical unit during the korean warokay one more thing  am i the only one who sees a hand carressing a breast on the album artwork  a right hand thumb up along the bottom part of the picture the thumb is resting on the nipple  the shadows along the right side suggest a left breast and outstretched left arm leading off the picture in the upper right corner the symbols are circling the top of the breast|1
this is a remarkable achievement with his 13th symphony allan pettersson succeeded in writing a piece of music that is about as pleasurable as oral surgery how did he do it well he wrote a continuous 67minute span of music with no sense of structure or shape at all theres no contrast between sections no memorable themes no sense that the music is going anywhere the whole thing is smothered in dense mushy orchestration occasionally you hear some jackhammerlike busy stretches but no development to speak of and no real climaxes its relentless but after a few minutes it gets aggravating then painful then just plain dulli actually rather like petterssons 7th and 8th symphonies where he keeps his selfpity somewhat in check but 13 was definitely an unlucky number for me if youre a masochist though or if you want to experience misery rather than just have it depicted for you you might like it|0

i got this cd hoping to be blown away by the sound improvements and i was deeply disappointed  if your looking for that deep rich sound you heard in let it be naked or the beatles love you wont find it here  the packaging is nice but you need a cd rom to see the mini documentary  i would not recommend this cd to anybody especially if you purchased the original past masters|0

i have a theory that pink floyd are good actually brilliant great for 4045 minutes dark side of the moon and wish you were here are perfect albums in my opinion and clock in at 428 and 444 minutes respectively meddle clocks in at approx 47m but when you get rid of the two songs that dont fit and shouldnt be there san tropez and seamus you get a mighty fine album of 407 minutesso to the wall a double album a concept album dark and depressing overall the double cd sat in my cd rack for years barely listened to i tried to listen to it all the way through but it was hard so hard was this the same group that had blown me away in my school days with dsotm and wywhthe key that unlocked the greatness for me was the live pulse album sans roger waters illogical perhaps but a wonderful distillation of the wall into the killer tracks another brick in the wall part 2 hey you run like hell and comfortably numb to me therefore the key to accessing and enjoying the wall is to free the brilliant from the dross to find the brilliant 4045 minute album lost insideso if you cant get into the wall at all cant muster more than 2 or 3 stars then burn a new cd or load it in to your itunes and create another brilliant album  playlist of  436 minutes1 in the flesh2 another brick in the wall part 13 another brick in the wall part 24 mother5 young lust6 hey you7 is there anybody out there8 comfortably numb9 the show must go on10 in the flesh11 run like hellthe floyd purists will no doubt shout heresy and that the concept story is torn apart but if you dont care too much for the depressing story of pink and just want to hear some amazing rock music then give the wall lite or the small wall or whatever you want to call the abbreviated version above a listen you may occasionally go back for the whole story just for interest but you wont get tired of listening to these 11 tracksmy star rating is 4 for the double cd as is 5 for my lite versionps ive just bought animals momentary lapse of reason and the division bell  gotta see if my pink floyd theory holds true for those |1
i was not aware there were two composers involved in the movies soundtrack and probably would not have cared one way or the other had this cd been produced as advertised  but it is not a soundtrack but rather a hash jobeach composers pieces clumped together so one can never get a sense of being in the movie of following the action in ones mind  pity  if anyone knows of the existence of a soundtrack cd that is truly thatsound that tracks the course of the movieplease email me  this cd was a waste of money|0

van cliburn was undeniably a unique artist who made many excellent recordings in the late 50s  early 60s he then suffered what appears to be a nervous breakdown and pretty much lost his capacity to make worthwhile music this 1972 recording falls into the later category for the brahms look to gilelsjochum or reiner richterleinsdorf rubinsteinkrips serkinszell arrauhaitink or live versions with gibson 1963 or markevitch 1956 fleisherszell or dozens of others depending on your taste for the rhapsody look no further than the composer himself conducted by stokowski with the philly o rubinsteinreiner wildhorenstein fleisherszell  katchenboult are worth a listen all of these are head and shoulders above this recording by cliburn for a good example of cliburn at his peak try the disc containing tchaikovsky no1 and rachmaninov no2 with kondrashin and reiner on rca living stereo a below average recording from a once great artist|0
i bought flyleafs cd over the weekend and just had to put up a comment about it  i would not rate this cd my favorite that i have bought in the past year but i would certainly put it into the top oh i dont know 20  it is a good cd having many good tracks on it but listening to fully alive on the radio then buying the cd and listening to the entire cd the cd was different than what i expected so that could be altering my judgement on it  there is a bit too much screaming on the first track and another on it i dont remember which one  buy the cd because it is worth your money just dont buy it because you really like fully alive because many of the songs on the cd are not like that song they are a bit heavier than that  a good cd overall and i will be buying their next cd coming out|1
such great songs  i listened to these when i was a child and now my little one loves them  still stands up over time as a kid favorite|1
i am a looooong time rush fan and have never review anything but leave it to rush to inspire me to do something new the message in this album is one that older rush fans will get right awayno how matter how many bad things have happened to you keep choosing to live who else could write that but neil worlds greatest drummer who else could sing that but geddy worlds greatest basist who else could put that to music but rush this is alexs worlds greatest guitarist best albumthe band is vindicated and now without a doubt rush fans are vindicated not that we did not know that already all good things get better with age and rush is one of thosefinally to see that for yourself listen to animate a pinnacle song for rush and one i think neil said is the hardest to play after listening to this album and you can see for yourself how the band has become better 2112 and this album are bookends to a collection that has sooo many great short stories in betweenhall of famerush is too good for you if you ask rush to join i hope they turn their back and walk awaysee you on tour|1

apocalyptic love is credited as slashs second solo album but in truth its more like like the debut album of his new band after a number of talentedbutunstable frontmen slash finally seems to have found his perfect musical partner in myles kennedy the tight and propulsive rhythm section of todd kerns and brent fitz is a force to be reckoned with as well rounding out the conspirators the results of this collaboration is a thoroughly enjoyable hard rock record that marks some of the best work of all the players involvedit may have taken decades in the business and several different bands along the way before finding each other but myles and slash both compliment and push each other in mutually beneficial and interesting ways though his work in alter bridge is stellar that band plays more to kennedys heavier more metal sensibilities with slash kennedy gets to show off his looser bluesier rock n roll side myles voice is quite simply a thing of beauty and the man is capable of singing just about anything his assortment of highpitched wails soulful crooning and lowerregister vocals are the perfect compliment to slashs playing which as usual is phenomenal and instantly recognizablethe album is a straightup blast of hard rock the kind slash lives to play melodic riffheavy and with an abundance of his trademark solos the joy behind the album is pretty apparent in every track as well it should be for the first time in years perhaps ever slash is playing in a band that doesnt seem on the verge of imploding at any given moment amazingly none of the albums 13 tracks 15 in the deluxe edition feel like filler for each of them carry their own groove and energy particular standouts include the title track standing in the sun youre a lie no more heroes anastasia and far and away though in all honesty these selections are merely personal preference as others have mentioned virtually any one of the tracks could be a viable candidate for a single the album really is that goodmost of the few negative reviews of this album seem to criticize it for what that particular reviewer wished it was rather than what it actually is those who complain that slash isnt pushing his boundaries or experimenting with his music are not only completely missing the point they probably arent very big fans of slash in the first place with apocalyptic love slash has delivered precisely the type of album he loves to make exciting high volume straightup hard rock with myles kennedy and the conspirators he has found the perfect band to realize his vision and the results are not to be missed every member of the band has reason to be supremely proud of this record and any fans of slash myles kennedy or rock n roll in general simply must check it out|1

simon is a pianist of considerable technical and interpretive gifts but this repertoire is totally unsuitable for him the discs contain the entire ravel works for solo piano so i will select those works that require the full measure of the pianist gaspard de la nuit miroirs sonatine and jeux deau not only do these works require a complete technique that allows you to play all of the notes with command but they require a delicacy of touch and  a dynamic range from the most gentle pianissimo to the boldest fortissimo the pieces also require the most facile and subtle pedaling an acute sense  of pianistic coloration and musical imagination virtually all of these things were missing from these performances i can only describe the playing as if he were using a beethoven technique and interpretive concept to play this greatest impressionistic music  to be sure i was not experiencing some inexplicable bias i played simons jeux deau and followed it immediately by a performance of the same piece by martha argerich it was like two different pieces simon was completely foreign to the world of impressionism  while argerich played like a fish in the water i made the same comparison with their performances of the sonatine and added a third performance by fredrich gulda simon was in a foreign land and  the others were right at home the scaling the touch the shimmering colors the dynamic variation  all were there what i found even more disturbing was the pianists frequent audible humming as he played  also an intolerable habit of leonard bernstein i would not recommend this set even for reference for a truly fine set get the friedrich gulda 4disc set which includes ravels sonatine gaspard de la nuit le tombeau de couperin and valses nobles et sentimentales debussy preludes complete with reflets dans leau lisle joyeuse pour le piano suite bergamasque the schubert sonatas in a minor and b flat major four impromptus and six moments musicaux  the gulda set is produced by andante and is called great interpreters|0
chickenfoots selftitled debut despite deserving a full fivestar review seemed in spots to be the sound of four great musicians still getting acquainted with one another not always sounding greater than the sum of its parts the same cannot be said of chickenfoot iii on which the band sounds like a hard rockmetal version of the allman brothers band or the outlaws incredibly raw and honest yet melodic and featuring incredible degrees of light and shade especially in sammy hagars voice and in the musical arrangements theres less of the partyhearty attitude and a darker more reflective tone in both the music and the lyrics which is in a way reminiscent of some of hagars older solo albums such as street machine and three lock box this could be due to the bandmembers increased political awareness as well as tough times in the united states and around the world even the one real party song on this cd big foot has darker under and overtones than anything on the first album the fact that the members of chickenfoot support efforts to free americans jailed abroad as well as hagars empathy for military personnel returning from the middle east the unemployed and the homeless and his advocacy of the right of police to use deadly force to rescue kidnap victims from their abductors make this cd an essential purchase for both your ears and your conscience|1
first offas far as the music is concerned the album deserves a full 5i dont care if certain songs are in mono or stereo as long as they sound goodsecond offfor some reason unbeknownst to mecapitol records chose to put 19621966 out as two discsit could have very easily fit on one discthereby slashing some of this reissues huge overpricecapitol records is why im only giving this album 2 starsthird and finallyrevolver was poorly representedcapitol could have added a couple of tracks from that album as bonus selections|0
the music was perfect for tai chi and it arrived on time in great condition|1
i bought this album recently at a local independent music store being a die hard music fan with an album collection approaching the two thousand mark its not everyday that i encounter a band im willing to write a review about in fact this is the first review i ever posted on amazonfor those who say flyleaf is another clone of bands like lacuna coil evanescence and avril lavigne i have to wonder if they have actually even listened to the album all the way throughi wouldnt judge the band based on downloaded tracks you find from questionable resources online since many times those downloads are radio edits that are washed down for more younger earsflyleaf in no one resembles any of the bands mentioned other than the fact they have a female vocalist if you were to compaire the leads voice to any artist out there i would say it resembles delores oriordan of the cranberries and even bert mccraken of the usedi would recommend this band to anyone who listens to hard rock or alternative since this band has found a great balance between hard rock riffs and musical melodythe vocals and lyrical transitions are impressive and mature for a singer thats barely 20dont listen to the critics and give this band a try i promise youll discover a sound thats unique|1
a typical boygroupalbum songs about broken hearts and missing somebody and bubblegumpop but there are at least a few songs that are not that bad everybody like a child if i dont have you and as long as you love me i mean that melody is not that bad so that the songs arent boring but the lyrics are just stupidso if you like the five cuuute guys youll love this album if not stay away and dont touch it this is just kitschy|0
i fell in love with im so sick immidiatly after seeing the videoi bought the cd and cannot put it down|1
ok self admitted rush fanboy here things got a little sideways with grace under pressure still had the magic but it was a little obscuredi got it some didnt i still stood by the guys thick and thin they were still gods among gods and forever did i pledge my allegiance counter parts hurtpresto was quite divergent as was hold your fire roll the bones had a measure of magic to it but stilltest for echo was a bit better and then vapor trails just screamed redemption except for all those great guitar solosexactlyhaving been to every concert since gup the proceeding releases were of slight consequencewith their long standing catalog did a few misses really matter not really they still brought the place down every nighti held off buying snakes and arrows as i did not want to be disappointedwent to the concert and didnt quite get those songs after nearly a year i gave in and got it i admit it took a while and i was able to get about 4 good songs out of iti should say great songs not in any way saying the others were badenter clock work angelsi went into it skeptically hoping for a song or two what came next just blew my mind i popped in the cd and proceeded to drive to work i figure this would be good use of my 4050 minute traffic sitting session never before have i experienced what i didby the time i made it to the middle of head long flight i was in a total frenzy you know when youre at a live show and about half way into it your favorite song comes on and everything around you just fades away and you are just absolutely swept away in rapture and existing on a primal level with the music that whole egoloss primitive part of brain thing well yeah i was there i couldnt believe it i couldnt believe what i was hearing or what i was feeling never do i do this cause i think its lamebut i actually had to play that song over again needed to feel that rush pun intended one more time and yes the bastille day reference was not lostah to be a fly on the wall for that one lolthis album takes a palate of emotions and mixes them into obscure shades that i really havent felt before or can really explain the true meaning of art is the ability for the artist to illicit an emotional response and the degree of response defines the degree of success and talent in that regards they succeeded immenselythe main thing that stands out with this effort is they took big chances and it paid off massively the new sonic direction that they took is just freakin great no other rush album even sounds close to this onewhat more can i saymy ears are ringing right now as i just wrapped up yet another listen is it all greatalmost theres a couple of tracks that are less than the others but the bulk of it is just pure rush blissi just wish their tour manager had more confidence in the guys and booked bigger venues so tickets werent 300 a popthats a bit ridiculousbut im going after allfood is over rated|1
i enjoyed most of the tracks but the method used to transfer the sound on this french import cd leaves a lot to be desired  i get better results from recordings out of my tape deck  i would love to get this cd from any  us based recording company because this import was dull and flat|0
i dont know why this inferior version is still listedand is more money than the remastered reissue with 5 bonus tracks amazon failed to list those tracks but ive done so in a review for that version|0
i listened to this on the way to yosemite with my wife sister and her two little kids  we were laughing so hard we had tears running down our faces  this guy rocksid previously seen the same material on comedy central and its even better when you see his face  but the audio version is still very very good  its also safe for little kids to listen to which is amazing these dayswe listened to it again 2 days later on the way home and laughed just as hard  brian regan is awesome  if you want to laugh this is for you|1
i really didnt like this album cause it just isnt the pink floyd im use to hearing  you can just tell its from the 80s they kinda lose their destinctive sound that is in such albums like dark side of the moon  i would not recommend this album but i guess if you like their later stuff get it cause youll probably like it|0
theres not much to say here other than its a solid rush album i did not start listening to rush until late 80searly 90s so i never was exactly in love with their 70s stuff though i later learned to like it  the musicianship is great as always  seeing them on tour a few years ago was one of the best musical experiences of my life  i would definitely recommend that if you like their stuff go see them live and damn the price of the ticket  it will be worth it  believe me|1
i heard the beatles album rubber soul the one with their one hit norwegian wood that song was good and the other filler songs wereehflipping my hand around like to say ehhhh you knowi always saw these guys as a one hit wonder but someone said you gotta hear abbey road by them and i was like okay apparently this band was an influence for great bands like hermans hermits and new order and stuff so i thought okayif i can find it ill chekc it out i found it checked it out uhever heard of a word called porduction lads theyi dont know when one song ends and the other stops they have different lead singers for every song the songs have no thru line or melody to speak of i see here that some people gave this thing 5 stars hello what theres a reason you never hear of these guys any more theyre probably all living in a shack trying to live on their little checks for norwegian wood|0
but every artist is allowed a misstep or two i suppose we should all do so well under the circumstances|0
i absolutely love the earlier lettermen albums they rarely did a bad trackbut this emotionless album is very weak with songs not especially suited to the lettermen and arrangements that simply dont fitlet it suffice to say that i have given my copy of this cd to the salvation army thrift store|0
as with the white album abbey road does not play with total clarity of sound as it is meant to it will skip in a couple of places after only being played once or twice in my car  one of my favorite albums of the beatles and one of the first of the remastered albums to supplement my collection|0
the songs for magical mystery tour the british television special in 1967 as opposed to the singles collected on the cd are some of the weakest songs the fab four ever released blue jay way is boring boring boring and flying is a throw away piece of filler the title track and your mother should know are terribly written and seem like they were just cranked out in 15 minutes the only good song on the whole soundtrack is fool on the hill and that pales compared to other songs by paul such as found on the revolver cd the collection of singles on this cd are good but even songs such as all you need is love and baby youre a rich man have fared poorly over the years while im a big big beatles fan even i have to admit when the beatles made some low grade music|0
i just love the fact that i received an analog cd because they are so hard to get one at a great price now when you buy a cd today they take out all the imperfections thats why i would reccomend this cd but most of all this seller product came in perfect condition and i will always buy from this seller and i erge you to do the same|1
really great album but it was about syd barret not roger waters i like this album only cause im a goth punk kid so yah|1
chailly has gotten his hits for his meandering reading of the bruck 6 from  amsterdam so its time for barenboim to step up and take  hisagainafter 20 some years barenboim still hasnt gotten down to  the serious business of planning and setting up a porportional performance  of bruckner and proportion is what the sixth is certainly all about  we  cant say that his work this time was pieced together in a studio because  its liveand you can tell because the orchestra isnt up to its recorded  standard and thats something you realistically allow for in concert  tapingsstill bending over backwards this sixth is moderately better  than his spraddled chicago mess of this great work  still leaning  forward its all around the place with a finalecoda so fast its  grotesque the inner movements disjointed and rubati that result in poor  ensemble of an unconvinced orchestraim beginning to wonder if maestri  today really believe the listening public will actually put up with this  type of musicmaking much longer because this is not really acceptable for  routine concerts in the american provinces much less those of a continental  center like berlinor maybe we do as a rule put up with it since  barenboims tarnished star shines brighter than ever through all the  interplanetary rubble his orbit has scattered|0
i dont actually own this album in my colection but with compilation disks mp3 etc i have heard nearly all the songs i have to say this is the worst beatles album ever sorry  im not saying its bad its just the beatles are the best group in the world ever and this realy doesnt do justice to them  i am a fan of all beatles songs but there first songs are nowhere near as good as there later more mature albums  there are quite a few more maturer songs on this album than on a hard days night but i find them a little boring and not as easy to listen over and over a hundered times like i do with all other beatles songs  unlike old albums such as please please me beatles for sales songs arnt catchy enough  bfs is an attemt at being more mature but the songs just do not work  if you have all the other beatles albums and you need to complete your collection get this all big beatles fans should have it  but get please please me and anything after revolver first|0
i find this album cd or whatever you want to call it pretty boring i mean metheny is obviously a master but if your expecting anything comparable to bright size life youll be disappointed imagine kenny g with a guitar synth and some cool wind noises behind it im sorry if i just dont get it but i dont|0
i used to be a huge genesis fan but i switched over to rush in 1991 because of their musical mastery especially in terms of lyrics that were not ridiculously inane my two brothers helped convert me as well i have seen rush live 3 times since 2008 once in my hometown every song on this cd is absolutely awesomeexcept maybe bu2b2 definitely worth the money|1
i bought this bc i had seen the movie and thought the music was great it doesnt include all of the songs that were in the movie|0
amazingly kerplunk sounds even inferior productionwise than green days first few eps that were recorded for about 200 per session john kiffmyer who had been jilted in favor for tre cool as drummer was at the helm as producer its a bad idea to allow your former drummer to be the producer on the album hes being replaced on dont get me wrong most of the songs on here had potential to be classics but they all sound like crap the vocals on the kerplunk version of welcome to paradise are woefully flat plus theres the very noticeable vocal flub where billie says it sic now feeling like my homeand im never gonna go there are bits and pieces that hint at how great this album shouldve been amidst all the ineptitude and sloppiness of the rushed production like the superior instrumental break in the middle of welcome to paradise the eerie bursts and wails of the guitar definitely top the dookie versions too bad nothing else in the song does also the intro of one for the razorbacks is very unique so is the acapella words i might have ate and so is the semiacoustic no one knows i loved who wrote holden caulfield its a shame theres far too much filler and far too many missed opportunities on kerplunkbest songwho wrote holden caulfieldsongs i would have loved had they not been killed by sloppy production andor flat vocals2000 light years awayone for the razorbackschristie roadno one knowswords i might have ateone of my lieswelcome to paradise80my generation addon from the sweet children epnot worth more than one listendominated love slavesweet childrenstrangelandbest thing in townandroidbottom line just buy 1039 smoothed out slappy hours instead the whole disc is filled with solid catchy and classic indie green day songs ironically kiffmyer was the drummer on those songs was there a kerplunk sabotoge you be the judge|0
the first cd was pretty good but this is just boring and dated talk about generic i cant understand all the good reviews unless people are so starved for this genre of rock they will listen to anything songs are wimpy compared to the first cd too and the sound is not as full hagars talents have never been with his lyrics and it shows here more than ever save your money|0
bought for granddaughter and she just loves it it came well packed and very quickly one of the best things to buy for little ones|1
as always george porter jr produces cool sophisticated and funky sounds the sly and earthy runnin partner and rough spots stand out and i wish is one of the more poignant on the road songs ive heardporters virtuosity on the bass is unparalleled so far as i know and this isnt as well showcased with a larger band like the runnin pardners as it is in a smaller group  too bad but the band is pretty awesome alsohow porter can be a funky meter an original meter a runnin pardner and george porter jr all at the same time is a mystery but it does mean that he works a lot and residents of the crescent city are lucky enough to get to see and hear him a lot  this album might be the next best thing|1
luther guitar junior johnson came into his own with this smokin disc after making a few good but not amazing albums  this cd cooks from the first to last song most of which were originals penned by johnson  he is one of the best keepers of the west side or magic sam style of chicago blues preferring more soulful blues as well as using a saxophone instead of a harmonica in the backup band  there is also a lot of variety here mixing straight shuffles cant get along with you slow blues im from mississippi graveyard dogs funk i want to groove with you and even country texas cowboythis is a smokin disc from the first on and i suggest that if you like chicago blues but havent heard luther johnson than get this cd right away|1
for years i have heard christians say that you will fall away from god if you engage in meditation their words never sat right because the psalms are full of verses talking about meditation on an aspect of god i have searched for different tools to help me get closer to god knowing i should meditate but not really knowing how i think rhonda has done a fantastic job in producing this cd after listening to it i found myself saying 20 minutes cant be up i want more wanting more of god is a great place to beannamarie|1
everyone knows that slash is one of the top rock guitarists of all time and he sounds great on this record  no surprise  myles kennedy is exactly the right singer to take slashs riffs and transform them into great songs that get stuck in your head and keep you singing them  if you havent ever checked out myles do yourself a favor and jump on the bandwagon hes sooo good  the thing i liked best about this collaboration is that its true to hard rock roots of the 80s but also seems current and relevant  i love it  favorite tracks anastasia  the title track|1
great music heard open secret back in 1992 didnt know the artist though for years trying to remember the lyrics and hoping someone would put them up on the web which i ended up finding them around 20102011 got to take with the artist first hand as well great guy|1
the songs are all in a different order and ive just seen a face is not even on it  i dont know if it was a different release but the cover is the same  very disappointing because the order of the songs on the album told a story and this is just a mixedmesh of beatles songs|0
a lot has already been written about this so i will keep it to bullet points great arrangements the strings in lieu of keyboards is brilliant finally a way to strike a balance between lifesons guitar work and the cool layering that lee does on synths and it fits the theme very well the lyrical repetition is either a bit too much or done well depending on how much of a rush nerd you are the mixing and mastering job is every bit the mess that vapor trails was which makes it fatiguing for repeated critical listening yet another album which i hope gets remixed and remastered in my lifetime id have easily given this five stars otherwise everyone shines on this album but neils drumming just keeps getting better i love the runicsteampunk thing but otherwise the album art is terrible|1
well its official rush cannot make a good album without terry brown  now it didnt take 30 years for me to realize thisit just took that long to accept itgrace under pressure was the first album without terry brown followed by power windows  even though they radically changed their sound all of the properties of a typical rush song catchy melodies instrumental virtousity compelling lyrics etc were still there  the formula was intact and still worked despite the tears for fears package it was being delivered inthen came hold your fire  for the first time i found myself fast forwarding my way through a rush album  was this a joke  what was this glossy effeminate sound coming out of my speakers  its as if they strategically decided not to write any memorable riffs or melodies and instead create newagey soundscapes that geddy would just sing over  i thought i was listening to the thompson twins minus the melodyhold your fire was for me and probably many rush fans the poison pill they would never overcome  every album since has always been hyped as the rush returns to its roots record  all of them failed  the rupert hine releases presto and roll the bones phased out the keyboards but were mindnumbingly laid back hollow sounding records  rush then tried to get their swagger back by going grunge with counterparts and test for echo  unfortunately clean and sober guys in their mid 40s singing about finding their feminine side is a hard formula to sell as a grunge record  no matter how loud you turn up your guitar volumeat the end of the 90s my enthusiasm for rush remained intact despite this bizarre metamorphosis  a quick trip to xanadu or la villa strangiato was always a good remedy to abominations like tai shan second nature and anagram i was still delusionaly positive  its a good album but not quite moving pictures of course was how i described presto  surely the band that recorded hemispheres would someday make a record that i didnt have to hide from my friendsi remember back in college trying to get my roommate into rush  i played the exit stage left concert video for him confident that once he heard the middle section of freewill or the live bytor and the snow dog guitarbass battle he would be hooked  he was intrigued  then roll the bones was released  as soon as he heard face up he was done  how could i blame himbut i still held out hope my favorite band would one day make an album i could be proud ofthen came vapor trails and snakes and arrows with the proverbial rush returns to its roots prerelease hype  unfortunately that meant a change in production and sound not songwritingand it wasnt for the better  alex was still in soundscape mode but instead of dreamy ethereal atmospheres what fanbois call textures or colors was now a wall of noise assault void of any intricate playing or memorable riffs  geddys annoying addiction to layering his voice only got worse  furthermore ged doesnt even try to write a vocal melody anymore  their songwriting formula becamestep 1  write a bunch of small instrumental partsstep 2  cut and paste them together to form songsstep 3  get the lyric sheet from neil and sing over top of themthere was no natural flow between verse and chorus  the lyrical melody often clashed with the melody of the musicso after snakes and arrows i finally came to grips that rush was no longer capable or interested in making a good album  in retrospect i secretly felt that way after roll the bones  but i like many other rush fans would never dare express itdoes clockwork angels change that  nopethe obvious weakness of rushs songwriting formula is vocal melody  for example in caravan the caravan carries me over line is completely out of place from what is going on musically  its the musical equivalent of wearing a paisley shirt with plaid pants  its understandable how this occurs since alex and geddy write the songs independently from neil  sometimes its obvious that neils lyrics are just sprayed over top at the last minute  fortunately it isnt as prevalent as it is on snakes and arrows an album totally void of melody but it does still occur  sometimes to compensate geddy oversings in places where subtlety would work much better  the title track and carnies feature a plate of ubervibrato and overdubs that are difficult to stomach  on the bright side at least there are no cringe inducing whoa whoahs this timeone frustrating aspect carried over from snakes and arrows are the solos or lack thereof  remember how far cry was ripe for a ripping alex lifeson solo  but insteadyup you guessed it more sonic soundscaping  this happens on clockwork also  bu2b sets you up for a real face melter however we are treated to lazy harmonic atmospherics from alex  seven cities of gold leaves you hanging as wellthe poor production quality is very well documented  rush is a band whos forte is playing their instruments  the wall of noise production style serves a band like tool or deftones well  they dont really play their instruments they make sounds with them but drowning the greatest power trio of all time in it should be a crime  you have to really strain to hear any intricate playing going onon the positive side there is more songwriting cohesion than on snakes and arrows but thats not saying much  the anarchist is probably the best song theyve had in years  the memorable guitar riffs catchiness and vocal melody all shine through hereclockwork angels is not a heinous album in the hold your fire mold  one could argue that its the best of their worst albums which is everything post power windows  so if moving pictures is the 5 star pinnacle of all rush albums and other rush staple albums such as hemispheres and 2112 are 4 stars then that makes clockwork angels a 2 star album at best  any more is just delusional  is this album on par with permanent waves or aftk  hell no  the 5 star reviews are just laughable  notice most of them claim you have to listen to this record 10 times in order to begin to understand its greatness  translation  you have to listen to this record 10 times in order to convince yourself that it is any goodthats how i felt after test for echo  not anymoreso after 30 years why cant rush make anything close to what they made in the 70s and early 80s  the answer is terry brown  it makes you wonder what rush would have been without him  more interestingly it makes you wonder what rush could have been if they had kept him  imagine power windows produced under terry brown  wow  instead rush hired producers that gave them way too much rope to hang themselves with  terry brown would never let a song like dog years get on a rush album  even geddy now admits tai shan was a big mistake and they should of known better  terry brown understood that 3 amazing players like this needed separation and definition not sheer volume  but at the same time songwriting was just as important as instrumental acrobatics  songs like freewill and red barchetta are technically dynamic yet catchy and singable  the first time you heard closer to the heart tom sawyer fly by night or limelight it stuckbecause they were good songs you didnt have to listen to them 10 times in order to get it  in fact it would be challenging to sit down with an acoustic guitar and play a lot of their current material because it could not stand out on its owni sincerely hope that before the guys call it a day they bring back terry brown for at least one albumohand hey guyswhen you go on tour in support of itfor gods sake please leave the fat suits washer and dryers and chicken roasters back in toronto|0
man i hear what rush did from fly by night until presto and hear this last worksi just cant believe is the same bandi really cant understand what happensi see that they really want to do great songs and compositionsbutoh godhow a soberb inspiration go out that wayif they want to try to return to the roots they need first of all call againthe producer terry brown producer from all rush albuns until signalsto me the real rush inspiration go until signals|0
i was expecting more elaboratefun filled musicie full instrumental  music to really perk up the celebrationsthe various artists i think  only one group sung the entire selections  contained in the cd have  brought disaster to the occassionanother zero rating for this cddont  buy this cd|0
not anointed the way i was thinking is very boring and the sound is very low i think is not the fault of the seller but the producer|0
this is no where near being the full and complete score to the early 80 actioner  this is in fact an extremely lame and hacked up version of the actual music thats in the moviei actually wrote to varsande one time asking when the complete original score would be published and they had the gaul to tell me that there were no more source recordings  every fan knows different  even the production company director george miller and composer brian may know and say differentlyso why no more music  its fairly simple  whoever did the initial release dropped the ball and shrugged at not getting all of the source material to the studio  then being limited for time on the old record album format probably came up with his own dance mix of the music and sound effects which is what we have on the soundtrackthe person who screwed up royally in helping produce this thing the errand boy or gofer or whoever who lostforgot and just tucked away any of the other source recordings and then didnt tell his boss about it you sir are a jerkwell maybe someday fans of the film will be able to get all the music  but until then live with what you got|0
name another band that made what could be their best album after 38 years together  cant think of one  nor can i  what was this album they made  a progressive rock concept album  in 2012  now in a time where autotune is a given and no one is famous for more than a season this trio made an album that couldve climbed the charts just as easily in 1976  and the lyrics  a journey through a sprawling dystopian scifi world told with absolute sincerity  perhaps thats why the hornrimmed hipster set branded them uncool they dont know how to be ironic  they just play great music and tell some honest and interesting stories with a point  thats a shame maybe if theyd sneered at the fantasy and wore skinny jeans they might be played at some parties in silverlake or the east village  maybe if theyd  burned themselves out in a blaze of excess and insanity after hemispheres theyd get into the rock and roll hall of fame  nope these guys who are almost 60 and at the top of their game just belted out what might be their best album in almost four decades  to me thats a big deal|1
cause no ones gonna buy a disc with two interviews and a few little pictures first off im a huge pink floyd fan but am not such a big fan on these crazy interview cds they have look at the used and new section 2 bucks the people selling this cd have probaly waited over 5 years nowtotal friggin yawn this cd along with all of the other 5000 interview cds there are suckhuge fan of pink floyd|0

i think i like more his chopin than debussy i feel its little bit too academic playing lacking a spiritual concept in conjunction with a little bit on romantic site debussy can not be romantic when that appeals in a quality of playing it becomes schmaltz  i would recommend giorgi latsabidzes interpretation of debussys preludes where you find and discover a great range of varies colors and make you really forget that a piano is a percussion instrument latsabidzes tone is very rare and recording is superb although he recorded only second book|0
this is a bootleg album not an official release made in an european country and sold here pretending to be the real thing it has a bar code and everyting these bootlegers just keep getting smarter ha dont buy this thing|0
now i was born on floyd literally me mum and dad listened to them when i was still in her tummy i first watched the wall when i was 10 i think and i have most of the albums i dont have pulse or distant sound of thunder go figure hehso im what you would call from the waters school of thought i absolutely cannot stand momentary lapse of reason the only good floyd song on it is yet another movie and round and around most of the songs are either too flat lacking the waters bass touch or too high the horrible learning to fly to be good floydi hear people all the time bashing final cut which i absolutely cannot fathom fc is infinitely better than mlr as the moodiness of it fits the drug theme pervalent throughout most of the bands musicmuch of mlrs music almost does seem to be imitative of older floyd the dogs of war  dogs or a new machine  welcome to the machine the first time i listened to the album i figured hey i liked the division bell and that didnt have watersit seems to me that for the short instant after winning floyd to himself gilmour was on a power trip and tried to steer the band along lines of music more hip at the time mlr just doesnt feel like old floyd it doesnt have the length and ambiguity of animals it doesnt have the surrealistic acid trip feel of saucerful of secrets nor the wonderful instrumentals of ummagumma nor long pieces like echoes or atom heart motheri star my fellow floydians is too high a mark for this disappointment|0
in search of a better understanding of the essence of native american cremonial music i found myself quite dissapointed on hearing this cd  reading each song title as i went  i discovered the same two songs repeating over and over as the titles changed  this cd does a disservice to native american culture by not properly crediting the tribal origin of each song|0
the last sonata ive heard recordings by schnabel michelangeli kempff and recent recordings too but malcolm binnss performance is the best too bad binns recorded in the waning years of lp and had the additional stigma of historic billing who wants to listen to tinkly old instruments the 1840s broadwood piano binns plays provides a ballsy greater contrast between treble and bass all to the good but even if binns played on a modern steinway his phrasing is right on the money this recording isnt available on amazon at present but it is well worth tracking down on ebay beethovens last sonata is his greatest and binnss performance meets the master drama|1
well it appears to be official  rush is dead  oh the band may play on but their inspirational and creative way of making music had died a quiet death  this collection is completely uninspired even worse than snakes  arrows which contained only a handful of songs worth listening to  the musicality is muddy and uncertain  the concepts are nonexistent and the vocals are often actually boring  its as if someone put together some elevator music and rush decided it would make a good album  to borrow a line from caravan i cant stop thinking this is the worst rush album ive ever listened to  the best way i could describe it isboring  ive been a rush fan since the late 70s but there always comes a time when a band need to accept the inevitable  no one can continue creating great music forever  rushs time has ended  the band has simply run out of ideas  its time to stop  now  pleaseill add that i scooped up this album when amazon put it on sale and im glad i did  i probably wont get more than two full listens out of it so it certainly isnt worth more than 5 for me|0
as previously stated by other reviewers this title is presented at the wrong speedrendering it unlistenable and a worthless purchasethis edition sacrificed quality as a space saving measure for tofit in more bonus materialthe bonus material would be welcome as a second disc and all held to the properspeedpick another version until this one is correctedi wish i had listened to those other reviewers before i ordered|0
the first time i heard of flyleaf they were opening for staind and i was literally blown away  lead singer lacey mosley came walking out from behind the stage wearing a hot pink teeshirt and jeans and i was thinking that they couldnt be that good and then they broke into cassie and i realized quickly that i was dead wrong about this band  picking up their cd after the show for a mere 2 i listened to it the whole ride home and reconfirmed what i had decided at the concertthis band is one to definitely watch out for  while their selftitled debut album has a few low points it is filled to the brim with high points as well  lacey mosley has such a wonderful voice soft and fragile one minute then utterly commanding and dominating the next  her scream while not as demonic as that of otep is a definite earcatcherso im sure almost everyone has heard a least one of their everpopular singles  the first single released im so sick is one of the best tracks to introduce yourself to the band with  its heavy pulsepounding rock with so much edge and attitude its unbelievable  the chorus is catchy something you want to sing along with but it doesnt feel overly formulated like most of the rockpop out there today  there is nothing pop about this track  another track that matches the intensity of im so sick is cassie one of if not the heaviest tracks on the album  its a very jumpy song as it totally moshpit worthy  breathe today is a heavy track but it suffers a bit in the versestheyre a bit unimpressive  its like that talkrap kind of thing that is so played out  lacey has such a beautiful voice she should have sung them it would have made the song betterthe second single from the album fully alive is another side to flyleaf  its a much more commercial radiofriendly type track but it still possesses the signature sound of the band  its a very deep and moving song if you really listen to what lacey is saying and read between the lines its always rewarding to read between lines  perfect follows suit with fully alive in delivering a good rock song  i was not a real fan of the track at first but it has grown on me quite a bit  better yet is im sorry a track that evokes immediate attention  the musicianship while not intricate is in your face and rattlingthe third single all around me is actually my favorite track from the album and it sets the foundation for the third side to the band the soft and meaningful side  laceys voice reaches new heights of delicacy here and succeeds beautifully at captivating the listener  sorrow is another track that capitalizes on this style  the verses are elevated by laceys beautiful vocals that transcends to even higher depths within the chorus  the closing track so i thought is probably the most subtle and moving of the tracks mentioned here  its beautifully constructed and lyrically its so moving in its simplicitythere for you is a different breed altogether  flyleaf enlists the help of dave navarro to create this track and while its not a bad song it fails to reach the same levels as the balance of the album  its a bit repetitive and uninteresting  i expected more from the track knowing that navarro was on board but youd never guess he was anywhere near this trackthere are many tracks here that touch upon risky subjects one in particular is red sam  its apparent that quite a few artists suffer rough childhoods and whatnot i mean its these tragedies that spark most artistic ventures believe me i know and this bleeds through on a lot of the tracks presented here  songs like cassie and fully alive sorrow and so i thought are elevated to heartbreaking memoriam when we contemplate the events that must have inspired their penning  when artists bare their souls for their audience its a moving and emotional thing and i for one am touched and pleased with the final result  heres to anticipating flyleafs next offering|1
this is a fantastic performance of the complete beethoven nine symphonies and the great news is that you can buy it for 599 on mp3 or for 1015 in a tin box with wonderful glorious sound quality if either of those is unavailable go ahead and buy the now out of print everest release but dont buy this version in the little cardboard box as pictured here the sound quality is quite bad i dont know what theyve done but its as if somebody owned a copy of the lp played on a poor stereo recorded it from there onto a cassette tape using a cheap consumer tape duplicator then  perhaps  removed the pops  clicks from the now 3rdgeneration copy of the originalgiven one of the good releases also available on amazon here is my reviewi grew up listening to the beethovens 9th from this set when it came out on everest records later i purchased the entire set  they were cheap then as now since then i have purchased dozens of complete sets of the entire nine beethoven symphonies as well as different editions of his complete works after all these years i still have to say that the absolute thrill produced by the climax of krips brilliant performance with the london symphony et al of the 9th symphony is unsurpassed by any other recording i have heard and approached by very few indeed overall this remains my favorite set of the complete beethoven symphonies i still remember hearing the eroica the first time i finally received the complete set in the mail i was so taken with the recording that i took the day off from school  playing hooky for the one and only time of my life little did i know then i had found my favorite set years and thousands of dollars later i have found no greater satisfaction with these great symphonies than these miraculous recordingsfor the record if you want a more modern recording the most satisfying set i have found is the one with riccardo muti conducting the philadelphia orchestra ive heard most of the other favorites and have to question the slam dunk critical praise for karajans famous 1963 set its great as are dozens of others  one favorite of mine is george szells cleveland orchestra set  but if you ask me this set is a wonderful bit of music making i recommend it to everyone regardless of how many other sets you own and for those of you for whom this is the only set you own dont feel like youre missing out on anything beethovens greatness pours out of every bar it is my favorite recording of beethovens symphonies and the sound quality with the sad exception of this bescol label release is miraculous for its age find the right one enter krips beethoven complete symphonies into amazons search engine and stock up buy a few dozen copies while theyre available youll be buying these for friends and family|0
a fine jazz album for people who are not sure if they like jazz  the music is pleasing without being offensive or particularly moving  sure it is a fine place to start but one would hope that a persons tastes would  deepen quickly  i always had a suspicion that this album was rediculously  overrated and seeing the reviews here confirm my feelings  its a good  pop jazz album not as swinging or interesting as anything else back then  and a bit dated now  one reviewer said take out your kenny g and put  this in  i am sure it was meant as some kind of slam on kenny g but  it seems like a fair estimation on the impact this record has had on jazz  i am sure that jesus likes mingus more|0
this album hits the spot of why so many love rush its got the blend of hardedged guitars and of course pearts drumming is everpresent as a backbone of the sound  and lees vocalssure theyre not any better than they were before his voice has never been something to brag about but its a signature rock band soundthis bands sound  and guys admit itif you were singing well youd be no different  i just love this album|1
some people claim that there was no pink floyd after roger waters left for others there was no pink floyd after syd barrett went mad and left floyd back in 1968 but in both cases the others left behind went on using the pink floyd moniker and did quite well for themselves when waters blasted the floyd following his departure as a spent force creatively the gilmour camp riposted by stating that they would prefer to be judged by the next pink floyd album which turned out to be momentary lapse of reasonso lets judge shall we first of all this album which was largely concocted by gilmour and a team of session players wright and mason hardly even play on itcould be considered a gilmour solo album even the previous and far superior pink floyd album the final cut often considered a roger waters solo album had more imput from other floyds than this one does but in fact dave gilmours previous solo outing about face is much better than this album there is too much late 80s atmospheric synth gimmickry here and not enough interesting tunes gilmour often makes it seem like his battles with waters came from the clash of his musicality with waters interest in album concepts and lyrics but theres little evidence of that musicality here  gilmour did come up with great tunes on occaison eg wish you were here and comfortably numb but theres nowhere near enough to carry a whole album here learning to fly and one slip are decent songs while on the turning away and the instrumental terminal frost are quite good indeed the rest is rather dull in my opinion at least gilmour and co were to do much better with the division bell|0
miklos rozsa i found that this may have been a work done in earnest but im afraid this album just doesnt cut it as this is one of films greatest scores and it deserved much better and it finally happened with the tadlow recording of the complete score buy this one if you want but the tadlow is the definitive one to get and definitely worth the money sorry but thats how i feel|0
i miss the floyd as they used to bean introspective experimental phycadelic group who were not afraid to venture slightly beyond the realms of normal human understanding and experience i just cant feel that much sympathy for waters here and the lyrics while beautiful and poetic at times do not convey subtle or layered messages as his lyrics used to personally id much rather listen to take up thy stethascope and walk which is an insanely dark song compared to this material it seems like pretty much the only tradgity waters has to go on is the death of his father when he was three months old while that is certainly tragic hey my friend lost her dad when she was 11 which i think would be alot harder finally i have a guestion to ask after hearing this album for the first time did anyone here say to themeselves god syd i wish you were here|0
i am going to echo everyone who says that this cd hasnt left their player being someone that changes her cd every few songs it is rare for me to keep one cd replaying over and over i love the combination of laceys sweet childlike voice mixed in with some well crafted hard rock notes i had been going through  some down times in my life and this cd is just what i need the lyrics and music really relate to my issues and help to find serenity in my faith i recommend this everyone a|1
bought this for my mom since she watches my little boy while im at work and they love the songs|1
dogs pigs sheep cute  there is such a thing as taking a concept album too far and missing out on the main point which is creating enjoyable music if that appeals to you buy animals by pink floyd|0
if you are unfamiliar with the wall then come out from under your rock  and too all young ones who are force fed the music punk metal rap they all hear today understand there are standards for music or there were at leastrock is dead as we know it today so do yourself a favour and experience rock in its purist form experience the walleven tho my favorite floyd songs are on other albums this is my all time favorite floyd album with darkside a close second followed by animals and wish you were here go check those out too|1
why would anyone purchase this elevator musak when one can obtain great instrumental christmas versions from real artist such as kenny g chris botti dave koz jim brickman and othersif i could give it less than one star i would you should avoid this product at all cost|0
the two performers take over the pieces and make them their own  mendelssohn drops out  instead we get two musicians showing how clever they can be  id  just trolled ten naxos music library downloads of these pieces prior to this album and this version stood out all by itself  its art but its flighty and not mendelssohn to the earsits worth noting that the release date of this cd is 1994 almost 20 years ago when the two chaps were fire eaters and young turks eager to push themselves to the forefront by audacity and dazzle  alas for that|0
this is a great cd for children  easy to learn songs that children love to singalong with  i highly recommend raffi|1
tikhon khrennikov 19132007 is best known for his still muchdiscussed role as the secretary to the union of soviet composers under zhdanov the booklet notes are thus mostly taken up with attempts to exonerate him completely and portray him instead as a hero the notes are in other words not very good khrennikovs own music has been decently served on disc however and has been described as mildly interesting not very original but not completely without merit either but i have seen such descriptions being used about his symphonies and concertos i have not hear any of those i admit but when it comes to the ballet napoleon bonaparte that judgment is certainly inaccuratenapoleon bonaparte a fulllength ballet was written after the fall of the soviet regime it was commissioned in 1993 and premiered in 1995 the booklet writer may be right that it has no political content in fact to me it sounds like it has no content at all if you can imagine khachaturian at his most glaringly banal though one suspects that khachaturian was aware of his lapses into banality and took some joy from them you have a clue to what youll hear here the music is bright glaring often loud and does not for its whole duration contain a single noteworthy or memorable thing tuneful but the tunes are consistently shortbreathed and annoying brash and incessant the music thumps along in lighthearted vapidity without a hint of charm passion or inspirationall this manyfaceted palette of emotions is realized with the help of khrennikovs usual melodic richness broadly breathing music brilliant and colorful orchestration writes lev ginsburg i have no idea what work he has been listening to this is in other words a truly dreary work and worthless to anyone but the most specialized scholar of postsoviet music the performances thumps along as well but has dreadfully little to work with  so to compensate it seems they try to play loud pointing out this doesnt exactly help should be unnecessary in the end ill award one extra star for possible historical interest and for the enterprising nature of russian disc i truly hope they continue to explore the byways of soviet era music emphasizing that the extra star is not for musical quality|0
i really hate to say thisbut the photo on the cover makes him look like a certain type of movie star  and im not talking about disney  i know a lot of people over the years have been edified by carmans music  i personally dont like it  but good grief his album covers are painful|0

really wanted this cd in the worst way but unfortunately it wouldnt play on my sony equipment so i had to return it|0
the replacement killers score consists of two good themeatic tracks johns theme and the temple with the rest of the cd consisting of electric percussion and other strange background  sounds the lack of the good techno music from the beginning of the movie  was a huge disappointment the lack of which makes this album pretty  mediocre even with the other two good themes a score which worked better  in the film than on cd i recommend it only to the most hardcore movie and  media ventures music fans|0
the pickup could not play the record without stalling and playing the same turn over and over and the opposit was claimed by the seller|0
the best album rush has come out with in quite a while the fact that its available in vinyl and cd says a lot about how this band takes album releases seriously i got both the cd and the vinyl the vinyl is a heavier vinyl pressing like the halfspeed mastered albums i still have and its split into two discs doublealbum style the sound quality on my turntable is excellent i dont have one of those plastic turntables either its a nice modded yamaha yp211 with a grado gf3e cartridge im not one of those audiophools but my 18 years of experience at a local mompop audio emporium taught me that price has nothing to do with better sound quality rush did a great job with the vinyl and my friends agreeeven those that originally thought that theres no way vinyl can sound as good or better than a cd for fans of vinyl this is a great example|1
well the theme of liar liar is absolutely beautiful and it gets stuck in your ear as soon as you hear it it is played in diffrent styles and with different instruments but its the only thing thats worth the buy  because there is nothing more the cd also is way too short but we  soundtracks lovers know this problem dont we so if you own the movie on  dvd just record the end titles on tape or mini disc and you got all you  need|0
hey its rush what more can i say there are very very few rush songs that i dont care for so i am not the best person to critique the album that being said i really like it|1
dont bother comparing it with other pink floyd albums dont listen to people who dont like it because its too long too weird too depressing or anything like that this is the definitive concept album of all time no album has used a story to convey the emotion philosophy and overall knowledge of its author than the wallroger waters made a masterpiece here some criticize him saying that he became a control freak and forced his ideas upon the rest of the band how can anyone blame him his vision for the wall was so perfect that he did not want it to be tarnished by other influences besides the other pink floyd members did not have much quality material to bring to the table anyway and what little they had gilmours collaborations on comfortably numb young lust and run like hell roger waters gladly acceptedthe album focuses on themes of alienation and the metaphorical walls that we build around ourselves to protect ourselves from the harsh realities of life each traumatic event in our life is a building block for this wall roger waters motifs and symbols have been interpreted by hundreds and are still analyzed to this day the amount of complexity in the lyrics is staggering this album has the literary effect that any classic novel can bring along with music that rivals any band at their bestmusically this album has no equal it is not the dreamy atmospheric sound of dark side of the moon it is much more dark and melancholy than that album it also tends to be more rockoriented shedding psycadelic tendencies for arena rockesque riffs and rocking songs but that shouldnt turn any dark side fans away its just as significant as that album was it has production and musicianship that surpasses anything the floyd had previously done this album proves that pink floyd could work in a variety of different sounds yet still retain their trademark sound as dark side wish you were here and animals didthis album has changed my life its made me more aware of the effect that the past can have on our lives and the consequences of loneliness theres too many insights that ive gained from this album and theyre probably different for everybody else anyway basically this album needs to be given a chance by everyone its sheer brilliance will really astound you|1
it really saddens me when a masterpiece such as the wall is being verbally attacked and chastised by a brigade of bigots under the aliases of kid reviewers unemployment must be a bigger problem than i had thought|1
i was so happy rush finally came out with another studio release and for good reason i think this is the best rush album ever released ive always loved these guys and went back and listened to some of the earlier stuff just to make sure and for me this is the best the musicianship is flawless the songs are very well layered but yet it has a raw sound about it that cant be beat this is one of those albums that you can listen to over and over and it always gets better rush has just dethroned dream theater as my favorite band again lol|1
i wasnt very happy with this cd as i have her others andtherefore thought that this one would be just as good howeverit wasntit was okay but not what i expected|0
this is not an studio albumbut actually recording of a live concert from tokyo in 1992 in front of enthusiastic audience who seems did not notice how strange her interpretation of gershwin classic the man i love soundsmilva  famous for her richcreamy voice that has something of red winedarkness in ithas left her san remo victories long ago and metarmophosed in a cabaret singerat least hereas ideait sounds good on the paper songs famous between two warsbut  alas  singing in different languages is not her fortewhen she sings in italianits really great but when she tackles englishthe results are to put it mildly mixedits painfuly obvious she doesnt understand the lyrics and poor gershwin ends up being turned upside downsundays and mondays are all mixed up and to end it allmilva belts how she would take her hand instead of the man from the famous songwho was supposed to hold her handafter this ridiculous and unintentionally funny gershwin who deserves to be heard to be believedour heroine promptly destroys french classic mon homme yesthe same one that fanny bricebarbra streisand and billie holiday covered as a gentlebitersweet my man with a mockingcabaret rhytm and turns it into something sarcasticwhatever she sings afterwards its not really important anymoreas milva  the cabaret singer is aplauded by happy japanese audience for whom is obiously not important does she hold his hand or foot or something else|0

this side up is a melodic voyage into the world of contemporary jazz two accomplished musicians jones and bridger open up a range of styles that are very pleasant relaxing and upbeat i especially like green eyes and rio del mara smooth transition from mellow to a latin influenced beat i played this cd nonstop during an open studio art event many people passing through commented on the qualitybeauty of the music and a 4 year old danced his way through my yard im looking forward to the next bridgerjones cd|1
okay since i first wrote this review ive gained more of an appreciation for pink floyd but this still doesnt do anything for me the concept about a rock star who slowly goes insane and blames said insanity on everyone but himself is about as pretentious and heavyhanded as they come unlike those of dark side or wish you were here and there are far too many minutelong link tracks that do nothing but pad the album out to two discs though to be fair some of the full songs another brick in the wall pt 1 goodbye blue sky one of my turns dont leave me now nobody home the disturbingly queenesque waiting for the worms and the overblown trial arguably the worst song in pink floyd history and while the best songs mother another brick in the wall pt 2 young lust hey you run like hell comfortably numb are easily worth repeated plays theyre scattered across the album which may leave you hitting skip more than youd care to admit to make things worse roget waters sadly confines dave gilmour an excellent guitarist to the background though his solo on comfortably numb blows me awayi cant see why the wall is so revered  get piper at the gates of dawn meddle dark side of the moon wish you were here or animals instead all are far better|0
they call this one of the digital remaster series and while you can hear that the sound quality is an improvement over the original when you compare it with the other digital remasters that are out there this one pales in comparison  the sound volume levels are still very low and it makes you wonder if the reason for this is that they did the best that they could with a severely deteriorated masterstill the minilp gatefold sleeve replica design is first class and they even have in addition to all the lyrics in both english and japanese great round art fallouts that resemble what was on the original vinyl centres  and now to the content itself which is truly brilliant composition by mostly waters and then the rest of pink floydironically if you truly want to understand the album youll need to get the movie that was done much later with bob geldof playing the lead role as pink the rock star with the troubled childhood and subsequent life experiences coupled with drug and drink addictions which eventually lead his mind into a slow inevitable decline into insanityi read from an interview with david gilmour who plays some incredible guitar on this album as a guitarist myself im not ashamed to tell you that the guitar solos on comfortably numb bring tears to my eyes each time i hear them simply beautiful music and soloing with great heartfelt expressionin a guitar magazine how pink is really sid barrett that early founding member of the band who slowly went mad after drugs and drinks and what gilmour believes also was something to do with his childhood and genes as well  he would actually go on stage and play just one chord all the way through the set  i read that he would go to a clothes store and purposely order a pair of trousers that was 4 sizes too big and then tell the sales assistantthanks  just the right sizejust like on the wall the whole story is quite sad because like pink sid barrett was a true genius he used to write most of the material of pink floyds early albums check out the brilliant piper at the gates of dawn just like roger waters did on their later albums their true creative genius on their earlier works was sid  he could write great psychedelic lyrics and music but then alas began his downward descent into insanitythe wall has a unique combination of sound effects dive bombing war planes baby cries etc and great harmonies and even classical themes in addition to the rocks themes that tell the story of how a rock artist eventually loses his mind after having to deal with the early death of his father and the subsequent smothering mother a rigid and cruel education system and then after drug and drink addiction the unfaithfulness of his wife led him to selfmutilation and fullblown insanitythis is roger waters and pink floyds tour de force album and surely one of the best concept albums ever  you have to listen to this one from the beginning to the end at one sitting to truly appreciate its genius  a true work of art and this version is still probably the best one of the wall that is out there until they do a better remastering job and improve the overall sound quality of the recording  hopefully theyll do the same for dark side of the moon soon too  recommended|1
the sound quality is fine thats why i gave it two stars instead of one but it is soooo monotonous  except for a few minutes of a very loud frog it is the same thing over and over and over and over and over  i was expecting various types of frog and water sounds  i will never listen to it again  it is beyond me how anyone actually enjoyed this but i bought it based on other reviews so someone did  do not buy it if you are wanting any variety on frog sounds|0

i disagree with the amazonian critic the work is completely cohesive each song is contextual without the backdrop of the previous songs you miss the experience the artists intended the songs hold their own but together they create something else entirely|1
so many incredible pieces on this  if you dont have this you have to get it  its as good or better now than when they were and still are overplaying another brick in the wall  how many epic albums match the story set out in this collection of songs  how about none  if theres a limit to the excellence a band can put into a production pink floyd bursts through it with the wall  incredible guitar work and emotional lyrics funny sad angry insane its all here for your listening pleasure  just calling it one of the greatest albums of all time seems like an understatement  you deserve music this good so treat yourself while supporting a classic|1
i hate this whole cd im glad this sank with celines and decaprios careers|0
i havent ordered this cd  thank heavens that amazon allowed all the songs to be previewed first  this album was intended to be a gift for someone who is not familiar with the grandma got run over or the hippopotamus song  i think hed listen to the whole thing once copy those two songs then trash the cd  and i couldnt blame him  i cant imagine very many people who would like the other songs  yuck|0
hard to wrap your brain around certain thingsit was hard to wrap my brain around signals so soon after the dark solid rock perfection of moving pictures signals was another world completely  a synthetic place of otherworldly sounds synthesizers dominating the tone after their comparatively understated supporting role in earlier rush workits hard to wrap my brain around the fact that im no longer the guy in ripped jeans and a pentagrampainted jean jacket halfbuzzed and walking through the gate at madison square garden to see these guys in the late 80s and early 90s  with no responsibility at all and even less of a clue what the hell i was supposed to do with my lifehey if you know rush you may have heard this one before plus ca change plus cest la meme chose this has always been the point whoever we are whatever reason were on this quest the only constant is change  good or bad dont like it too bad the world already moved on in the time you just spent railing against itfor some this particular change for rush is good for others not so much this album speaks to me very deeply and im surprised more rush fans arent acknowledging the garden as the most deeply considered flatout beautiful song from rush in a long time maybe since bravado not musically perfect  rush has always been just slightly left of musical perfection  but with a melody so perfectly suited to the thoughts behind it and thoughts so far above what we see from other popular musicians why are we all here what are we here to dowho else is asking these questionswell im a dad now and now i know what im here to do what else can i do live by example make things better for my children tend that garden keep it as safe and beautiful a place as i can a place for my son to play to learn and live so that he can one day do the same for his childrenand if i could give him one thing  okay lets make it ten things  high on that list would be a love of rush because they have been nothing but a positive thoughtful influence in a world full of negative ones  in a genre filled with negative onesall of us get lost in the darkness  dreamers learn to steer by the stars|1
if you think you have roots in knowing great rock music then it is certain you know of rush and have owned some thing from rush  these masters of rock music will push your stereo system till it smokes and your amp catches fire  it is a must for anybody who thinks their sound system can play the best recordings ever made  each new album gives joy and helps the audiophile addict to escape and love his or her listening environment  thank you for making it possible to kick back and find joy from your sounds and talented stories of harmony  language  see what you think|1

this two disc compilation is a great album to listen to all the way through plus it has some good radioplayed songs like comfortably numb hey youm and young lust i highly suggest this album to anyone who has heard the songs on the radio any fan of rockclassic rock and anyone who likes good musicthis album deserves 5 stars|1
i saw rush in concert recently and this is the tour theyre playing right now i wanted to own this album along with the concert program and teeshirt i picked up while at the venue rush isnt one of my all time favorite bands but theres a reason theyve been inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame i enjoyed the concert and this album took me right back to being there|1
the wall is my favorite album by pink floyd it is one of the longest largest musical experiences i have ever had and ive listened to it at least ten times all the way through and will more no other band sounded  like pink floyd and none ever willevery song on the wall is  incredible i wont mention any because it would take too long this album  is possibly one of my five favorite albums of alll time it is truly  impressive this type of music isnt for everyone but it is worth trying  buy it|1
although i like it less than i used to it still stands as great proof of not only the musical talant of floyd but the depth of waters something missing from the postfinal cut floyd for beggining floyd fans this and dark side of the moon are the two you must begin with if you dont own it stop thinking and buy the damn thing notethe movie is not a companion piece and although in my opinion good not for the weak at heart|1
as a musician and lifelong student of music from ravel to wayne shorter to acdc i find this to be one of the greatest albums of all time  the textures created by the ambient sounds of eno only highten the great emotional depth oryemas music embodies  each song is a story  each song has a strong motif|1
my first reaction to this soundtrack actually live recording album was that it was so reminiscent of some of the poorer high school productions of anything ive seen  it had it all  atrocious poorly delivered dialogue with the important parts yelled really loud to make sure you knew this was an important part garbled speech so that not one complete line was thoroughly understandable amateurhour orchestrations and a group of singers selected at random from the seniorgrade drama classbut then i realized the recording bore much greater resemblance to dollardrink night at a karaoke bar  high school kids have suppler voices and more verve  this was the afterwork accountants and secretaries having several belts and then sidling up to the mike to do a cover of runaround sue  forget about the range of the singers all combined im not sure they have a full octave among them  several went frequently and grotesquely flat  with the possible exception of a quirky go now rendition every song was markedly inferior to even a barband cover of the classicrock songsthe idea for the show is audacious but you wonder why finding a group of talented people was a concept studiously avoided in its implementationthis album is a travesty  i was going to take it down for a few bucks to the usedcd trading post but i have some measure of ethics  so i broke in my new hammer on it  at least it worked well for that  too bad they dont recycle cd slivers in my area|0
the mendelssohn trios are well played yet dont expect the sound to be state of the art these were recorded years ago and it is what it is wonderful literature to hear but mellow like sound ron houser|0
this cd is horrible with the exception of love song for a vampire that song is absolutley amazing and would be the sole reason for buying the cd there is a definite lack of beauty and talent in this score|0
the first time around with this album hearing it and its couple of pop hits on the radio i commented to friends that it sounded like an entire album of david gilmours theres no way out of here from gilmours first solo album whereupon i dubbed this album as sounding like the dave gilmour bandupon finding and reading the liner notes and noticing that gilmour was the only member of the classic pink floyd appearing on all of the tracks with virtually no appearances by rick wright and nick mason i was surprised that the album lived up to my referencing it as the david gilmour band  i guess gilmour cant sell albums under his own name and had no qualms about selling out the pink floyd name for buckage  all one has to do is check out comments by nick mason regarding what it was like when the floyd got back together for live 8 but then again were talking about a drummers and bass players relationshipif you want to get a taste of what pink floyd was all about check out roger waters and skip this thinly veiled david gilmour band in a pink floyd wrapper aka pink floyd for poseursi wonder if gilmour will continue selling out via the pf charade now that rick wright has passed on may rick rip|0
unless youre an absolute grobschnitt completist you might want to pass on this disc altogether i liked their solar music live effort so much better see my review volle molle was first put out in 1980 and in my opinion the record label shouldve kept it in the can snowflake is the only decent track on this cd and the cut coketrainshow is a poorly done tv commercial spoof not good at all at least it didnt do much for me|0
if you are progressive and respect the great work done by the early labor movement youll love this disc  phillips tells stories between songs that help you to feel what it was like to be an iww member or organizer in the 20s and 30s  hes a great entertainer and raconteur|1
while coco was not the greatest musical ever written the score does have its merits and lerners wit shines through in the lyrics previn composed a gorgeous final ultimo in always mademoiselle just beautiful i recently ran across a youtube clip of this number as performed on the tony awards check it out its wonderful hepburn is fantastic look for coco hepburn and you will find it the rest of the score is serviceable pleasant if unmemorablenow to hepburn she could do no wrong and apparently pulled a musical out of the whatwasit category and into the hit column sure she was no singer but she was melodic and could manage to singsong talk her way through each number adding her own personal zest to each one and she totally immersed herself in chanel so it worked she kept the show running for her year contract after she left danielle darrieux replaced her an accomplished french leading lady much closer to chanel and a better singer however she was not hepburn and could not overcome the weaknesses in the show and it soon petered outmy biggest criticism of the cd is the quality of the recording didnt anyone listen to it before it was released it is tinny staticky and uneven the sound quality is atrocious be warned if you play it on a player with a disc changer when this cd comes on it will be decibels louder than any other and wasnt it possible to remix it before rereleasing ittheater history that should be a treasure to own becomes an annoying recording|0
i listened to this cd in the car and i found myself laughing so hard that tears were running down my face and i almost wrecked the car  brians comedy reminds us of how the simple things in life are usually the most funny  bryan regans live cd is a must for anyone needing a good hearty laugh  take luck|1
do not order this cd expecting a reissue of brenda lees decca album all alone am i  this is just another collection of her recordings and as such is in serious need of a track listing amazon has several better brenda lee collections for less money|0
this album is a debacle  its not even worthy of the pink floyd name  i have never recognized this album as pink floyd its a roger waters solo album  periodthe proper name for this album is roger waters  the final cut with special guests david gilmour and nick masonbecause its labeled as pink floyd that pisses me off  the band isnt even existing at this point  roger kicked out rick wright after the wall and roger david and nick recorded this album in separate studios  thats not a band its a charade  and there are waaaayyyy too many orchestral parts and the saxophones dont do it justice either  its evident that roger was an ego maniac and wanted the pink floyd name to himself  the lyrics are very selfindulgent and the music itself is a lot like stuff that was recorded for the wall but not used  its very evident on the heros return  if you cant hear it then your obviously not listening and in complete denial|0
this guy is amazing  i have seen his live act at the improv in dc many times along with letterman appearances the old showtime special and more and every time he has me in tears  his cd now lets me take his genius with  me in the car  i call it cup of dirtregan is the pure  essence of humor as evidenced by the fact that he fills to capacity a  room with all types of people and can make every one of them laugh bc he  highlights the general foibles of just being human  cabbie hey have a  nice flight  regan you too no sex no bad wordsevery track on this  cd is a highlight and represents some of his best work  this cd has mass  appeal and i guarantee anyone for whom you play it will enjoy it male  female old young mother father etcnow he needs to come out with a  volume 2 and include some of his best bits that were left off this cd  neil armstrong at a party moving into an apartment and getting phone  service peeing out the back of the station wagon and splitting a pie with  the college roommatebrian you are incredible  hope you the wife and  the baby almost one year old now are doing great and come to denver|1

this is the weakest link and the weakest folk album i have ever heard if this is irish rebel music than the english would like this music more than any irish man would james connolly michael collinsand eamon de valera would roll in their graves hearing this music the ira would have this album blown up with a bomb than let this be played i tell everyone do not buy this album it sounds band and is just not irish rebel music|0
i say the inside art to the duble ld and it sc ared me  the music didnt help  why do bnands like being so scary|0
people should realize the difference between importance and greatness  the beatles were by all accounts an important band but the music they made  rarely lives up to their legacy  this album is a good example of that  it  sounds dated and theres a lot of filler on it  if you experienced this  music when it was released then i dont expect you to find its sound stuck  in the 60s  today with albums like loveless in existence this album  pales in comparison from a production view point  not that all albums from  the sixties are irrelevant today  trout mask replica and exile on main  street are two albums that have stood the test of time  as for the filler  yellow submarine is by no means anything but a torture to listen to  this  really is elevator music compared to the stones zeppelin stooges and even  some of the beach boys albums|0
simply statedmagnum opus with a beautiful dose of david gilmourthere are some really terrific reviews here already but i couldnt resist adding my two cents as others have stated the wall is a polarizing album  people tend to love it or hate it im one of the ones who love it when i was introduced to the wall i was going through some pretty rough times psychologically and my misery needed some company i bought the double album and rented the movie from my local video store i watched the movie first i really think that this helped me to be able to grasp the narrativethe music is somewhat dark but not inaccessibly morose anyone who has ever experienced periods of melancholy should be able to tap into these feelings when listening it is not an easy listen though in order to fully appreciate the work it is best to actively listen preferably while blocking out other senses and thoughts ie in a darkened room without distractions i also find that it is impossible to share with others if the colistener is not a fan it is embarrassing to listen to it makes one feel exposed uncomfortably naked if the other participant is a fan however the experience is akin to the parallel play observed in toddlers they are playing alongside each other but they are not truly interactingalthough the music is subordinate to the narrative there are some truly sublime musical moments the song comfortably numb is my favorite song of all time if i can let myself relax it transports me to another realm everytime i listen to it the highpitched ding heard during the chorus focuses my attention and makes me feel as though i am floating on air other standouts are hey you mother and run like hell each is beautiful in its own way hey you is haunting both lyrically and musically mother is both stark and soothing i love the back and forth between waters and gilmour as in comfortably numb run like hell sets strong antifascism lyrics to a killer dance beatif you are psychologicallyinclined you will love the wall listen to it when you have the time alone and in the dark it just might transform you|1
great album must buy very clean buy it i was eating during listing and fell to the floor i was crying so much its funnybuy it now|1
i bought this cd expecting to get the entire sound track of the movie mask and was terribly disappointed to find it didnt include any of the songs in the soundtrack only orchestral music when i buy a sound track i want the whole package guess i should have been clued in by the score rather than soundtrack notation from now on i will read the descriptions more carefully the orchestral music is nothing special combined with the songs it would be worth having i know understand there is a cd available that has only the songs in mask i think it is very underhanded for them to have separated the two and not more clearly explained what one was not getting on the orchestral version|0
geddy lee once said in an interview after snakes and arrows came out that he felt that he hadnt written his best song yet  imho the garden is that song  if you are a fan of old rush this song has similar tones to entre nous  if you like the lyrics of professor peart the words will move you to tears  if you prefer the guitar riffs of lerxt this song has one of the best majestic solos hes ever put down btw alex also plays the piano solo part when performed live  if youve never heard of rush buy this one song|1

im a big oaks fans since year 97 ive bought this complation set without checking any reviews about it ive followed my instincets about him and iwas very dissappointed later after listining to the set of cdsthe tarcks on cd1  cd2 were mixed in a bad sequence plus the mix more like amatures or beginners in this set but ive to give him credit in prefecto travilling complation the oppossiet good sepuence and flawless mix|0
i purchased the audiotape version about 2 years ago and used it in my classroom  this year i purchased the cd version as well  the selection of songs is terrific  some that you wont readily find elsewhere  the mcneils did a great job selecting songs that represent the era and both sides in the conflict  the historical narration is informative and interesting  now for the disadvantages the historical narration sometimes isnt placed logically with a particular song  you also cant skip the narration and just play the song for the class to hear  i thought the cd would correct this problem and allow me to go right to the song track i wanted but unfortunately they did not separate the narration from the songs on separate tracks  you still have to listen to 12 minutes narration before you can just play a song for the class to sing along with  performance quality is unevenyou will probably hear better vocal quality elsewhere  still the advantages outweigh the disadvantages  great resource for families driving in the car also|1
1 star just for playing the wonderful sibelius and 1 more for the rarely performed nielsen however the performance and recording is just plain awful the sound is flimsy and detached none of the brooding icy fire that i usu enjoy in this music the oistrakh version still reigns supreme at the moment|0
this is a great baby shower gift i have other issues of raffi this product arrived on time and ready to go planning to buy more raffi as this child grows thank you jeffrey|1
ever since i started to listen to music for real ive searched for meaning in the lyrics and some spirit in the music i found this both in the wall which is in my opinion the best album ive ever listened to its like it  reflect my and many other that i know motion and sometimes how people  treat you in your life i recommed this to everyone that want to discover  who they are and where they fit|1
the fourth of july 1994 will live in the annals of infamy i was living in melbourne at the time whatever the merits of my hometown might be it is not known for its surfeit of haydn online shopping was still cranking up cataloguewise haydns opus 50 was undergoing a total eclipse of the sun the kodaly quartet had yet to turn its attention to the prussians whereas the famous account by the tokyo quartet on dg was rarer than hens teeth particularly in the antipodes desperate and dateless i purchased the salomon quartets survey of opus 50 on hyperion and at full tote too wowunlike many such acquisitions i have refused to part company with these discs over the years there they sit a permanent rebuke to follyrecently i steeled myself to revisit these discs true clipped phrasing is less evident than in their mozart but man this is vinegar central are we meant to enjoy this hideous timbre much like muesli is it for our own good should there not be a warning on its frontcover designed with wraithlike academics in mind i cannot detect any wider application moreover reticence is the order of the day isnt that equatable with classicism mmmmmhwill i ever return to these discs i think not we have enough feral cats in the area theyre pests i dont want the buggers to think that a moggyonheat is domiciled in our house that being said if you enjoy vibratoless twangs which are suggestive of feline ululations this disc and its sister are for you  meow|0

i expected a blaring exciting performance on beethovens epic ninth symphony in this album with leonard bernstein conducting the new york philharmonic for cbssony it turned out to be the oppositeall the other beethoven symphonies he recorded for cbssony are great especially the third the fifth despite an intolerably sluggish first movement and the sixth but the ninth is a complete dissapointmentdespite bernsteins overt and fast conducting the performance completely lacked the power karajan had and even the cleaniness and precision fellow conductors szell and ormandy had the brass in particular wasnt as blaring as they did on the thirdthe tenor was simply awful his timbre was one of the worst ive ever heard as for the julliard school chorus and julliard is supposed to be americas no 1 music academy no offense but the singers sounded immature a far cry from the rich clean powerful voices professional choirs utlizesone word terrible|0
its ironic that the album that would be titled the beatles would be the least together album of their careerthe lennonmccartney songwriting partnership would be almost nonexsistant on this album only actually writing two or three songs together if that many this album has lennon mccartney and harrison basically taking turns in making the rest of the beatles their backing band on each of their respective songsi personally feel that many of these songs could have been left in the garbage can songs like honey pie wild honey pie the continuing story of bungelow bill obladi obalda savory truffle and good night are all horrible horrible songsbut there are some real diamonds on this album too while my guitar gently weeps is probably the albums standout track while blackbird has a kinda yesterday status without sounding like a knockoff of course julia and dear prudence are two of lennons best songs and you just gotta love the album opener back in the ussr even if you dont like the beach boys soundthe problem with this album is that its filled more bad than good and being a double album thats a lot of bad|0
ok first i am an amateur audiophile i majored in music and spent two years in college miking and mixing live bands at the soundboard for the college tv station so my ears hear everything  the great to the terrible  sometimes my brain is independent of my ears wanting so much to love rushs vapor trails in 2002 i spent a week trying to tweak my new 51 surround sound system thinking i had it set wrong before i started to see the complaints online regarding the horrid production on vapor trails alex said one thing at the time  the band had pushed past digital 0 into distortion during recording  then we heard nothing about it from rush until last year when alex confirmed they were never happy with the production on vt but to my sheer delight that the album is being remixed and remastered there will be no rerecording but they will fix it in mastering where they can oh happy day for this rush fan of 30 yearswhy the above commentary because i have read many reviews here about the horrible or awful insert your favorite adjective sound quality on clockwork angels while i agree the sound quality is not always stellar it is nowhere near what vt was however everybodys opinion is correct with their reviews of ca because listening to music is a subjective thing many of us are musicians many of us are rush fans and we are all equal as rush fans i was not a fan of snakes and arrows i prefer my rush to rock  my favorite albums being permanent waves moving pictures and counterparts minus stick it out  sorry rush fans all 3 have been tied for first place depending on my mood so after not really enjoying sa i approached this new album with a tentative we will see i liked the first three songs caravan bu2b and especially headlong flight well enough to download ahead of the albums release then i read some reviews and downloaded the entire album to my ipod video 55 which has great sound quality having the original wolfson sound chip i listened through my koss portapro headphones yes these are quite awesome  i did hear some issues with overlaying of guitars and muddy guitars especially during the song clockwork angels but i loved all these songs so much so knowing the cd would sound better comparing the download of mp3s aac quality vs apple lossless encoder upload to ipod i bought that too i listened first through my sony cd portable and high quality sennheiser headphones ahha i could hear much more but there was still room for improvement so next i listened through my regular system with bw speakers and also through my harmon kardon amp with the sennheisers either way double ahha i could hear everything that was important to me oh major happy delight what an unbelievable great album rush has given us with clockwork angels there are no throwaway tracks i hardly notice that 66 minutes have gone by listening from start to finish my favorite song at the moment is seven cities of gold with that great rock riff that makes my head bop  reminding me of my other favorite band porcupine tree and their work from 2002 and 2005 if youve ever seen steven wilson rocking out hair bopping in his face thats me listening to seven cities sheer delight i love the ballads just as much however halo effect and the much mentioned the garden which may be the best ballad rush has ever done i love the pop hooks of the wreckers frankly the entire album with the added storyline from neil is such a joy to listen to  ive probably listened about 20 times nowmy advice is to listen to this album on the best equipment you can i trashed my ipod mp3 album it just doesnt compare to the broadness and clarity i hear with the cd and better sound equipment if you can get a pair of quality headphones  find out what sounds better to you  because thats what is most important and for everyone it will be different we rush fans tend to overanalyze their albums at times but its only because we care so much about the music and hold it all so dear i thank you rush  for your 40 years of brilliant musicianship and great albums clockwork angels has been added to my favorite 3 rush albums of all time so now there are 4 with clockwork angels edging near the very top|1
i bought this cd for my 8month old son after singing baby beluga to him for weeks i havent heard raffi in probably 15 years but i knew all the words to the songs and when i put it on in the car my son instantly stops making noise and listens intently|1
great super group van who  love sammy  and this bandtruly a great great bandwaiting for the next album by the foot|1
as others have noted this cd is a disjointed collection of music that doesnt flow like some of his other music it actually wakes me up when the song stops and then another one starts sometimes at a different volume the lullaby by brahms is annoyingly plodding if you want relaxing peaceful halpern music try prosperity or angels but not this one|0
love these songs  cant wait for my new grandchild so we can all sing along raffi does not will not disappoint|1
sure wish i had saved my money and purchased another of chets cds instead of buying this one because of the reviews i loved the picking but didnt like the songs will not play this cd again|0
if you dont like this album you probably didnt like fair warning or happy tails on diver down either  this album is more diverse than the previous album and its a great thing  there are plenty of good rock tunes on here like alright and big foot  but there are some other gems in come closer something gone wrong which is reminiscent of van halens big bad bill from diver down but more bluesy  all the songs on the album have a slightly different flavor  sadly one of the best songs is the unlisted no change from the cd release that is not included with the online download  this album has multiple good songs with great variety like the early van halen albums had  alright is already handsomely endorsed by my 2 12 year old son who keeps asking me to turn it up when we are in the car|1
i applaud the fact that rush are trying to create new music i just dont really get it to much singing and geddy sounds to high pitched at times i went and seen them in concert tonight and they only played about 4 of their great old songs at the end the rest of the show was bad mostly the crowd was bored they played most if not all of clockwork angels and alot other of the later year stuff that sucks|0
i bought three of the new digitally mastered beatles albums and this one was a disappointment  the music of course is great but the quality of the recording is by no means good  the other two albums abbey road and magical mystery tour are excellent  i have a better than average audio system and recording andor processing issues stand out  i would suggest getting an original copy off the internet as many original vinyls are becoming available  everyday|0
the rather tacky disk case and this page say various artists but dont you believe it in fact everything on here is by neil norman and his cosmic orchestra an instrumental rock group thats been playing cover versions of sf themes for going on 30 years nowi realize saying instrumental rock covers makes it sound kind of interesting but again dont you believe it the band were are and evermore shall be a terrible terrible band playing horrible versions of these themesworse yet norman et al frequently recycle their work as this kind of album without anything on the case to indicate who they are so if you buy these kinds of anthologies you can easily get burned and end up buying the same cosmic orchestra junk two and three times over in different forms i myself have bought 4 nnhco albums since 1981 and its always annoyingyeah yeah i know my railing against this album this band and the evils therein make it sound pretty interesting how bad could it be youre thinking i mean theres copies going on here for 25 cents if its that bad im kind of tempted to check it out just for perversitys sake well again dont you believe itits not nearly good but ultimately a failure its not intriguingly bad its not bad music that makes a good cautionary example its not bad in a way that makes it oddly charming as with albums by the sharks  its not so bad its good its just bad really bad the platonic ideal of bad in its most perfect form i realize some of you are tempted by this to check it out just to see what im railing against but one last time dont you believe ityeah used copies are going for only a quarter but even that is overcharging you by a buck they should pay you to listen to this drek|0
wish i would have discovered this album sooner  her voice is so intense and passionate  would have loved to see them live|1
clockwork angels is a really good album for a real rush fan  i especially like caravan the wreckers and carnies  i am going to the tour soon and cant wait to it live of course rush always puts on an amazing show  they must think highly of the album cos they play a lot of it along with some old stuff they havent done in awhile  this album is a must have for the rush fans|1
my obsession with this cd is more subtle i wasnt sure if i liked their new sound since geddys voice is slightly different here  i still admire their creative prowess and listen to this one as much as any other rush cd  they always hit their mark and i am confident that i will like any work they release even though some older fans gave this an average review i love it because it is outside the box|1
i ordered this cd specially for the last farewell  a favorite of my husband and i for many years how disappointing that the beginning is garbled beyond being able to understand the words|0
i find hindemiths music on this cd far too rushed and played a little too fast not every instrument on the symphonic metamorphosis is heard especially in the march and the orchestra totally rushes through the piece if anybody wants to choose better symphonic metamorphosises they should choose either the recording with yoel levi and the atlanta symphony orchestra or the recording with wolfgang sawallisch and the philadelphia orchestrai think the pace is much more slower and better and has more dramatic effect than this recording does the mathis der maler symphony is about the same way as the metamorphosis is the pace is way too fast and the music sounds more like george gershwin or darius milhaud than actual hindemith music as is the symphonic metamorphosis recording the only piece i like on this disc is the walton variations on a theme by hindemith because thats the only recording that sounds like what the actual piece should sound like i purchased this cd only to listen to the walton piece and this william walton recording by george szell and the cleveland orchestra will tide me over until i find yoel levis hindemith recording or wolfgang sawallischs recording of those hindemith works george szell is usually like yoel levi and wolfgang sawallisch but not on this recording eugene ormandy always ignores certain qualities hindemiths music needs and conducts really fast for no good reason conductors of today like stuart malina respect both hindemiths mathis der maler symphony and his symphonic metamorphosis eugene ormandy and george szell seem to not understand hindemiths music really well and these particular pieces are not suited for either of those two conductors herbert von karajan conducts twice as fast a symphonic metamorphosis as george szells and so does his mathis der maler symphony recording dont buy these for hindemiths music but buy it for the walton piece if you really want a hindemith cd so badly|0
honestly speaking i am not one of these typical rush fans that just absolutely loves everything rush puts out i honestly do not understand for the life of me how this album is getting 4 stars i thought vapor trails is better then this album  that isnt saying much i just dont get it before any of you rush fans attempt to try  rip me for saying this save it i have decided to add more to my comment here  i still stand by my original review of this album i do not like this album  i think that ever since rush parted ways with terry brown they have lost a lot of his expertise especially in the studio  it shows immensely after listening to this cd a few more times it just did not do anything for me i believe that most of the fans here who are giving this album 45 stars are doing so more out of loyalty then anything else in my opinion their last good decent album was hold your fire  in my opinion its been downhill from there their best years were with terry brown hands down  if he were to come back youd hear a major difference in their music|0
the raising arizona part of the cd is almost exclusively electronic and only one 90 second track of the great banjo that i remember from the movie  i recommend listening to samples before you buy|0
ok first i dont want to hurt anyones sensibility specially roger waters fans they tend to be hypercritical altough i think this all gilmourwaters confrontation is dull as hell and doesnt contribute at all in any aspectim a pink floyd fan that meaning that i truly aprecciate the band really great albums those who were a result of a colective sound and are their best excluding the piper at the gates of dawn which is a complete masterpiece only contrasted by sgt peppers wish you were here is the clearest example of this with 4 members working it off and making a true masterpiece of musicso what happened my theory is this and please respect it and dont bash it if ur beliefs are different roger waters has too much going on inside of him mother fixation father trauma the world unjustice factor and in some terms that was really or is great that made roger lyrics little pieces of jewelry that we all can relate to his composition levels were great and are too and with dave rick and nick behind them they had so much power and become floyd compositions tis was the floyd working at full machine of course the other guys have some excellent compositions too but this was an examplebut beggining with animals and finishing with this album it seems to me that the lyrics overrun the music that for me has been roger waters problem he let the lyrics led forgets about musicianship at all the oposite thing happens to david gilmour while he focus on the music the lyrics are allright but not just greatso thats it here for me it was a roger waters album because it didnt sounded like the floyd anymore there are some theories that say that there is not a pf soundcome on the atmospheric spacy sound the guitar work the lyrics it sounded more like an pop orchestra roger waters album i personally dont like his voice and he knew that in the late 60s and the early 70s he let the others sing while he made a right appearence in one or two songsso yeah it was a dissapointing thing for me hearing this after  animals 35 and the wall 3 this was floyd lowest point and not because this was and not a pink floyd albumthe music here is good though for an average album but nothing more than a vehicle for the lyrics and thats why these songs werent on the wall they just not reached the standarts of the band but mr waters took over and the rest its history|0
once again sammy hooks up w one of the greatest guitarist of this century and super rhythm section to release some great rock n roll|1
from what i can tell one21 has changed their sound quite a bit since this album and i think thats a good thing i would rather have someone pound tent stakes into my ears than listen to this garbage its a shameless rip off of operation ivy and rancid all the way down to the bass lines dont get me wrong theres nothing wrong with sounding slightly derivative all bands are to some extent but this cd is nothing more than a good clean fun version of rancid so why not just buy a rancid cd theyre fifty times better christian magazines even marketed the band that way if you liked rancid you were suppossed to like one21 a way to play punk in your moms minivan without making her angry i remember being so disillusioned when i actually discovered rancid and realized how much this band and christian bands in general rip off whats already out in the culture rather than creating something new in closing this cd is utter rubbish|0
what type of hard rock band is this reviews of all pink floyds  albums describe their songs as slow and relaxed so where is the hard rock pink floyd is a great soft rock easy listening bandexhibit acomfortably numb but a rock bottom hard rock bandmy dad likes pink floyd but then again he also loves frank sinatra as for me i think they rot this music puts me to sleep nighty night|0
disappointing it seems to me that the music recorded on the cd is selective and some of the ceremony is chopped also i feel that the tempo is a 14 beat faster than actually played i think if the foot guards  marched past at that rate they would overtake and pass the cavalry in about  a 12 mile good if you like military bands doubtful if you have done the  duty and want to reminisce if anyone has a suggestion for a better cd i  would love to know about it|0
if you think my title above is overstated then you havent heard this album  it stands up very well in comparison to classic comedy albums like bill cosby is a very funny fellowright george carlins class clown the buttondown mind of bob newhart and steve martins lets get small  his stories are about all of us but he does such a wonderful job of making himself the goat that you cant help but love the guy  and if you even listen to it a couple times youll never think of gentle ben grade school or the phrase you too the same way againnote that i did not compare this album to edgier classics by richard pryor bill hicks redd foxx lenny bruce and others who use what my mother considers foul language and sexual situations  this isnt because im a prude  i love those guys too  its just that regans style of comedy is more similar to the first group and anyone can feel comfortable playing it in front of kidsi on the other hand have now heard this album about 60 times and it never fails to make me laugh  i even loaded selected bits into my itunes to pop up now and then between songs  and i highly recommend it for long drives  not only will you be in a great mood but youll also stay wide awake from laughing constantlytake luck|1
i used to like this performance but i have heard several i would consider better and recommend them herethe karajandel monacotebaldikarajans conducting is more distinctive and rich for lack of a better word than levines domingo sounds wimpy and strained and too sane compared to del monaco and struggles far more on top mdm just has the more exciting voice tebaldi has a larger richer voice than scotto and sounds less mannered to my ears i like milnes but he is a bit too hammy herethe vickersserafingobbirysanekvickers is a fantastic interpreter and in this early 1960 recording is simply great no strain on top steely and soft at the same time gobbi is not a favorite voice of mine but he is an unsurpassed vocal actor in great voice and his voice blends very well with vickers rysanek is fineps there is also a good one with james mccracken in the title roleplease do give these a listen before purchasing this one most die hard opera fans will tell you the quality of opera has gone down find out why for yourself before spending your money |0
after listening to this cd at a friends house i have finalized my opinion on midori being a overhypednonemotional and mechanical violinst back when she was 13 wearing sailor dresses she was impressive for her age  unfortunatelysince then neither her palying ability nor her wardrobe have improved|0
i had always remembered falling in love again on an old old marlene dietrich recording i had in my college days for christmas this year my husband tracked down a recording with this song and i must admit that i was extremely disappointed with the scratchy sound track i had hoped that in some electronic way it had been digitally improved but not so|0
marcos is rightwhile the the original vinyl release of this is darin is terrific this is a terrible transfer hisses  pops from the source an old lp are clearly audible and the whole thing sounds like its playing too slow as darins voice on the cd is too lowsave your dollars and wait for a better reissue|0
i work with preschool and kindergarten students and this cd is a really fun and catchy cd that the students can listen to dance to and at the same time learn to follow directions some of the songs calls out fun little directions to follow so the students have to listen good the lyrics are well written the vocals are soothing and great and the music is really cool i love this cd and recommend it to anyone who either has kids or works with kids|1
the penguin guide to jazz recordings gives a rhythm section of tommy gumina on polychord fred atwood bass and jimmie smith drums they go on to complain not only of the polychord but of the overall sound quality as well but compliment art for blowing very hard throughout fan of the polychord or not let me inform you that stan getz plays the heck out of ill remember april on the stockholm concert with a rhythm section led by jim mcneely on piano|0
the cd was advertized as like new or some such language it was used and skips on three tracks so its far from like newthis is the second form that i have completed about this purchase whyalso how do i stop the constant messages from amazon i am really tired of constant emails from amazon i know where you are and can find you if i need you|0

i enjoy listening the chants however i wanted a cd that was in english so that i could also chantthis cd does the trick  the prayers are beautiful as are the chants  one track features a prayer followed by a track of musicthey are all uplifting and inspirational|1
hubby is a rush connoisseur and together have seen them 8 times this is a return to form and much better than snakes  arrows  this was part of hubbys birthday present and he loved it|1
this was the absolutely worst movie i have ever seen  the only original character acting in this movie is richard chamberlain  i dont know how it was ever released|0
disappointing  i came across abraham labouriel on gary burtons the new quintet  i thought he was the best bassist i had ever heard  but this album is more pop than jazz  there is nothing outstanding no flashes of brilliance|0
to my knowledge the beatles catalog has never been issued in the minilp format from japan it will be soon in september 2009 when the remasters roll out beware of shoddy russian bootlegs|0
i like abba the catchy melodies the bouncy beats and the often poignant lyrics were a very tasty package of ear candy that i think caught the world by storm  so in purchasing this cd i wanted to see what types of things frida would come up with  then i listened and found it to be utterly terrible  i hadnt realized that the hit that is on this cd was actually done by the frida of abba  i remembered hating that song back in the 80s and was now shocked to learn that it was from the talented abba singer  now i also must come clean and indicate that i loathe phil collins  i think sussudio is one of the most awful songs to ever hit the airwaves  so that being said the fact that this entire collection sounded like phil collins was no benefit for me  i did not enjoy this cd and found that it drained all the warmth from fridas rich voice  it was far too synthesized and sounded almost robotic  so my advice is if you are an abba fan stay away unless you must have anything recorded by the members of the group if you are a phil collins fan purchase it and just imagine it is phil singing|0
i own the cd and the concert nuff said|1
i cant stop listening to this guy brian is up there in the seinfeld  league for sure i love little league the best  if you dont laugh  at this guy you have no soul|1
you must listen to this more than once it may not hit you at first and each time you listen youll hear something new when most bands rest on their laurels and pack it in rush continues to grow and challenge clockwork angels is a masterpiece lets hope it isnt a swan song|1
perry como had some good times  in the 50s he had some decent hits even a small jazz band album thats pretty good  while his novelty numbers are dated there is a definite charm to them toohowever if you value the things i listed above then do yourself a favor and let this disc go outofprint quietly  its awful  comos voice has deteriorated quite a bit and not in a sinatrasatchmobillie charmingkindaway  his diction is too perfect on the lyrics adding no nuance to his vocals  it sounds completely mailed in  to add to the completely hokey and schlocky arrangements and the poor choice of songs there is an awful female choir which perfectly underscores how this album was out of place in any generationthe 50s the 80s or todayunless you want it as a collector i highly suggest you do a search for the collectables label releases  most of his old albums were rereleased through them including a couple very good onesso smooth and my personal favorite we get letters done with a 6piece jazz combo  he really stretches out on that one|0
i was very enthused about the release of this album after hearing caravan and bu2b nearly two years ago and seeing them performed live on the time machine tour i was very psychedwow this is the approach to the new album awesome so unlike rush and so very like rush then they released headlong flight which i downloaded immediately and was blown awaywith those first three songs my thoughts were if the other nine songs are as strong and unique this album could very well be their best evernot so muchwhile the musicianship on this album is outstanding  particularly geddys bassplaying as a few others have pointed out the vocals get a little monotonous at times the lyrics on a couple songs are weak and lazy and a couple of the songs feel like ive heard them before call them shades or castoffs of counterparts test for echo or snakes and arrowsthat being said after five listens i can say that i really do enjoy this album and would rank it in the top sevenkickass 55caravanbu2bclockwork angelsseven cities of goldthe wreckersheadlong flightthe gardenpretty good 45the anarchisthalo effectits ok 35carniesforgettable 25wish them wellwaste of time 15bu2b2total score 4960 82  4 starsseven kickass songs on any release is pretty damn good and overall this is a strong albumi look forward to the forthcoming tour|1
in my opinion this is the worst album released under the pink floyd name in the 70s pink floyd had become known as a band who could create songs with thoughtful lyrics and great melodies this was because albums like dark side of the moon meddle and wish you were here were collaborations between all the band members on these albums waters started to show how great he was as at writing lyrics but the melodies were put in place by the rest of the band especially gilmour because they were great musicians even the best songs on the wall were collaborations between waters and gilmour and the wall is a good conceptthe final cut seems to push the concepts in the wall that one step too far it is well known that songs rejected from the wall were put on the final cut but waters had alienated himself from the rest of the band even gilmour and included these songs anyway one may ask if they werent good enough then why are they good enough now and if you listen to the album you can really only conclude that they are not good enoughi think the main difference in the production of this album is that waters had stopped listening to everyone else in the band he had already forced wright to leave but during the production of the final cut he finally alienated gilmour as well and it seems to me that gilmour had always been the valve that stopped waters from taking things that step too farunfortunately this album is dreadful because of waters overinflated ego roger waters finally quit pink floyd after this album and followed the final cut with a string of mediocre solo albumsin conclusion i give this album 1 star because i cant give it no stars|0
first i am not a gnr fan  sure paradise city and sweet child o mine are good songs but i just dont like their other stuff  i think axl is a dbag and i cant stand his dyingcat howls  i got this cuz it was supercheap and im a fan of alter bridge the band myles kennedy fronts  i generally dont give a hoot about singers but theres something about myles that i really digi had no high expectations for this album but was blown away at how much i enjoy it  catchy groovy with some great variations in the music  myles even almost raps on one track and its great  ive been jamming to this album and tremontis new solo project nonstop for the last week  i suggest you get them both|1
for my rush is tremendous band his music his lettering are the best band of progressive rock good cd simple  rush|1
absolutely the funniest comdey recording ive heard  its clean its timeless and you can relate to it  brian regan is the king of comedy|1
unless youre a flamenco affecionado or just a guy who occasionally likes to listen to good flamenco i would stick with carlos montoya  personally i did not like this cd|0
this is really a stunning set of songs from konte i hadnt realised hed passed away until i read one of the reviews posted here of course he sounds nothing like leo kottke but he can move with that same dazzling speed say on baa to toto whilst imitating a frog belting a bluesy barrelhouse piano sound and simultaneously unfolding a melody elsewhere on daua he hums like an insect over a sitar sounding piece the moods vary from festive rollicking  through booming rhythmsto eerie melodies like kottke without witnessing a performance its hard to believe only one man is making such a surplus of music|1
rush returns to form  very heavy very deep feel to all the songs  excellent thought provoking lyrics from neil  this will take a few long listens to fully appreciate its message|1
i love kentucky fiddling and this is a wonderful collection beautifully executed i am learning the banjo and this is a great learning tool for one trying to grasp the nuances of fine kentucky oldtime music|1
well any album you buy from brozman has got to be good this one kind of takes you back to a time when the blues was the blues|1
nothing memorable nothing melodic no virtuosity displayed time to call it a day and move onthis coming from a long time rush fan|0
i have the black box full set and i love it but i have a friend who just cant sit and listen to three cds worth of music and was having a hard time getting into les miserables  so i thought that this cd would give him the basics and maybe want to listen to the whole thing  i listened to it and thought that it sounded poorly made  its almost like the music and the singers are not in sync in some of the songs  the voices and the music dont sound nearly as crisp in this version as it does in the full version  i wish i could get my money back for it and make my own mixed cd|0
this is underrated music that deserves to be heard but unfortunately these performances do not come close to doing it justice compared with many of the better baroque and early music ensembles this group simply does not measure up the performances rarely rise above the routine and frankly make the music sound boring which it isnt very disappointing especially as most of these works are not otherwise available|0
sebesky should have made a straight ahead big band record  unfortunately he indulges in the same syrupy string arrangements that marred so many cti releases  the remainder is mediocre funkim happy cti is rereleasing much of their catalog but this is too much fluff  theres some obligatory coltranestyle blowing but these musicians are better heard elsewhere|0
we absolutely adore this cd set  the songs are so whimsical and fun to listen to  we have only had it for two weeks now and my 21month old daughter has memorized half of the songs already  we keep the cds in the car and my husband and i have noticed how much more enjoyable our cartrips have become  at the end of each song my daughter says mama  more more  we find ourselves humming raffi tunes throughout the day as well  were creating fun family memories through the gift of music|1

if youve got a taste for sandra it never got any better than this  to have seen it live back in the 80s in new york city was a lucky break for me but this recording is an amazing record of that eventthrough the years sandra has been frustrating arrogant angry dismissive contradictory and even tiresome im sure she would be happy to accept all of that but then again who cares about her offstage  one should appreciate the work and there is so much to enjoy herethis is theater this is performance this is perfectiontruly a comic masterpiece|1
this collection is easy to listen to my baby loves it and the songs are addicting for both daddy and i  its a must for babies|1

this is one of michael w smiths first albums and well worth revisiting  i enjoyed listening to this one after not having had it in the collection for about 15 years  a must for any michael w smith fan|1
my only experience at amazoncom gone wrong i bought the item paid and not received never buy from this seller because he is not honest|0
the wall is neither pink floyds greatest nor their most popular album but it is without a doubt one of the most misunderstood and brilliant albums of all time representing a number of paradoxes that the average music listener never takes into account before listening the wall has been transformed from a mainstream billboard topping release into a most cherished underground albumin order to fully comprehend the album it is a necessity to take into account a number of factors not on the album of chief importance were the sociopolitical issues of the 1970s and the vast transformation mainstream music was taking from the more serious rock n roll into the mindless disco beats conceptually the wall is about conformity and yet at the same time its about not conforming proposing the first of many paradoxes contained within the albumupon release it was immediately hailed as a classic by society at large to paraphrase another reviewer it was the album to have the wellreceived greeting the album had can almost entirely be attributed to the songs another brick in the wall part2 and comfortably numb in fact to this day they probably comprise ninety percent of the total airplay the wall receives and over the course of the following decades the majority of the remaining twentyfour songs faded into near complete obscurity with few exceptions this can be mostly attributed to two reasons the morass of the album as a whole and the depressing tone of the rest of the albumanother reviewer said it best its very difficult to sit through a complete listening not only because the album is so long but also because its so miserable in tone yet his statement brings about another paradox while the album is long and decidedly miserable its also very difficult not to sit through a complete listening because its almost impossible to fragment the album listen to the fragments and take from them any kind of understandingwhile the tone the wall takes is miserable its also necessary not a single aspect of the plot is something light casual or cheerful although its overwhelming depression the wall still manages to momentarily coalesce into something joyous even if the subject matter is revolting most notably the songs one of my turns bring the boys back home waiting for the worms and the trialthe plot of the album can be viewed two ways some prefer to think its a good look into the psychology of the human mind especially when confronted with being excluded while others prefer to think of the album as a very imaginative and creative story regardless of which stance you take the plot is a startlingly vivid and disturbing look at the dangers of conformity and mass media propagandain the end the most important thing to remember before listening to the wall is that while yes it is depressing and that yes its subject matter is shocking its designed to be nothing about the albums contents are to be taken lightly this is not an album that can provide background music at a party it is however an extremely creative and thought provoking album unique in more ways then one highly recommended for anyone who looks to get more out of music then just simple thrills|1
im hardly a fan of garth brooks musiccuz all of his albums sound the exact samein fact for me he has had only 5 good solid songs for his careerbut two of them are here on this debutthe dance which is a great  song if tomorrow never comesthat songs is very honestin fact my  favorite of hisbut the rest of the album just like the rest of his music  is pure formulapredictable|0
the conductor was way too fast on tempo especially on neptune a piece that needs to be taken slowly to be enjoyed at times i wondered if he was on speed or trying to break a speed record either way save your money my recommendation for a bargain planets is the lso one with geoffry simon|0
this guy was called big and he should have been named big fat and ugly who would really find this enjoyable to listen to most all rap music is just the same beat same rude lyrics sung by black guys rubbing their crotches now that is really attractive fellasdo yourself a favor instead of buying this cd go get yourself some real music some r  b or maybe motown that is real but this rap crap is a big waste of money|0
this is the best album i have ever heardevery single song on this cd is great this cd is truly a classic if you dont own it you need to buy it right now it consists of classic songs like another brick in the wall and comfortably numb this is a must own album|1
of course i would love more from rush but this would be such a terrific way to go out for all the press about how this is a concept album like the great seventies pieces this is the most adventurous rush has been in sometime almost like they skipped ahead a few albums worth of progress to record this one there are moments here where you are like whoa this is rush because they are working for a very wide palette that includes textures that they have never explored before i was not fond of snakes and arrows for a couple of reasons i disliked the overproduced sound and missed the positive energy of the eighties and nineties releases on a record that was densely bleak everything seems to work better here on an album that works best listening to it all the way through in one sitting i cant think of a better summation of rushs career than the garden even though that is the least rushlike thing on here i find myself wondering where they might go from here after such a triumph while this may not be the best rush album it certainly seems like it will be my favorite|1
what a disappointment  the cover of the cd leads one to believe that since there is a chorus that the lyrics will be sung  that is not the case  the cd is instrumental only  it is classic ray coniff orchastration  but for those who want the lyrics this is not a good choice|0
i actually never heard before something so bad in terms of sound engineering its absolutely unreal to listen to this discs on high level stereo system i skipped half of first track and second track completely finished me off looks like mastering was done by probationer sound engineer i never heard so unnatural sounding violins they were equalised so badly that its impossible to listenminus 5 starsps this review is relevant for high level stereo systems only|0
never buy a soundtrack out of its context as a qualified civil war buff i can easily relate to material even if incomplete and fragmentary it is all too obvious that this is a soundtrack hence listen to it while viewing the documentary get some other new renditions of old songs from somewhere else|0
ive been a fan since 1985  this is ballsier than anything theyve done in decades  ive had mixed feelings about everything theyve done since the 80s and snakes and arrows definitely sounded like they were starting to get old but this album turns the clock back in a big way  and wow the taurus bass pedals are back too  make sure your sub is adjusted|1
my grandsons had these songs and loved them so when my granddaughter was born i purchased his songs  as always the babies love raffi|1
i like rush but this one is a dog  my favorites are test for echo grace under pressure and hold your fire  rush was big in the 80s but i think they were better in the 1990s|0
this is the worst turandot ive ever heard the sound is so bad that i have to return it take my advice look elsewhere the vhs martondomingo is gorgeous it is the best but marton does scream her head off although leona mitchelle is so gorgeous that you forget caballeif you dont want dvd ill take the mehta with the great pavarotti and caballe sutherland is also fab but just caballe and pav makes it great|0
i love this album i was leery at first as albums based solely on a linear story line can be confusing if you dont know the material however when i first listened to the albums first three songs caravan bub2 and the title track clockwork angels i was intrigued the richness of the music is just as i would expect from a veteran group of highly talented musicians lyrics are thought provoking and entertaining the rest of the album does not disappoint i think my favorite song is clockwork angels lyrically wish them well and the garden are great i have this entire album on my playlist|1
i really like this album off flyleaf because it has some of here acoustic on it and love that type of music an she is an amizing singer to|1
first let me get it out of the way by saying i am a huge beatles fan however i just dont see the point in buying a remastered album by any artist  remaster is simply a industry buzz word  all it means is that the album is cleaned up from the originals so to speak  oh yeah and they throw in the bells and whistles of glossy photos and all the song lyrics  oooh big deal  as far as i am concerned it isnt a very big difference from what ive heard and a few tracks ive listened to so far  that is all fine and dandy if you are adding to your collection with albums you dont already own  but frankly most beatles fans are die hard fans and already own all of the studio albums  i dont understand why anyone would want to shell out more money for an album they already have for very tiny improvements and a few bells and whistles  it is just another way for apple to financially cash in on the cash cow that is the beatles  as a fan i am angry that apple would be so greedy and in a way i feel they are taking advantage of us  they didnt do this for their fans  they did it out of greed plain greed  why dont they just give us what we want and release beatles on itunes i know that issue is quite complicated and easier said than done especially with the remaining members all having to agree before a project or release is committed to  but they can do a lot better then just releasing remasters and crap like across the universe and the even more dreadful love|0
i love karen carpenter although i appreciate richards talent i wanted to hear karens voice to this day i believe that the world lost the best singer of all time|0
i was just browsing through some of these reviews and noticing that theyre usually either 5 stars or 1 star the reason for this is because the wall happens to be the most complex album ever recorded you either have the intelligence to comprehend it or you dont its that simple roger waters is a genius when it comes to writing even if you find him to be egotistical he shines as a lyricist i really feel sorry for the people reviewing this and only realizing the melodies yet failing to understand the complete story being told this is a piece that requires your full attention and asks you to think a little bit about the subject matter also the subtle little things that pop up throughout the album make it that much more brilliant for those who are able to pick up on them the sound effects that accompany the songs allow it to draw people into the work and delve deeper into the mind of the characters experiences it really makes you feel as if you just have to stand by and watch as everything is happening you want to reach in and lend a hand but youre unable to affect the outcome like a bystander in an ongoing war witnessing the horror from a safe haventhis is definitely the thinking mans music eloquence personified|1
in this recording dr jane simington does a great job of creating a safe environment  a place conducive to complete relaxation i instantly felt at ease and allowed her to guide me through the process at the end of the recording jane recommends that we journal about our experience which i loved this is a great way to remember any insights that you may have had during the session or even just to take the time to write down your thoughts and feelings about it she also encourages you to draw a picture of some part of the experiencei definitely recommend that you use this recording to help free yourself of emotional ties that are no longer serving you and feel more joyful jane does an amazing job of guiding you through the process and after listening to them just once i can honestly say that i feel lighter already|1
did i mention it sounds like rush and that is what i want i hope they keep turning out the music like this|1
this is not a good floyd album even though i liked aome of the songs|0
its good to hear those rail road folk that i havent heard in years  the mcneils have giving a new generation a look at americas folk tradition|1
i mean cmon people this guy is a hoax you dont need to be a master musician or even an avid listener to realize that every single track on this socalledalbum sounds exactly the same and all the lyrics are sung  to the same 23 notes over and over is that what you guys are calling the  creative force behind next centurys merengue  besides his  voice is utterly annoying sort of like a male fran drescher and the guy  is ugly as hell if you want true merengue go out and listen to rikarena  bananas sergio vargas etc there are so many out there but this guys  media overexposition and terrible sound are enough to make anyone with a  decent ear for music sick this guy should be thankful im giving him a  full star|0
vladimir horowitz is one of the greatest pianists of the twentieth century  his magisterial command of the piano is second to none for much of the romantic repertoire  his liszt scriabin schumann tchaikovsky and particularly his rachmaninoff not to mention his scarlatti are superlative and possibly even definitive  i am much less impressed with his interpretations of the works of the two greatest titans of the keyboard literature beethoven and chopin who i will refrain from discussing here  in my humble opinion horowitz sounds bored with the sonatas on this recording  its as if hes playing them to fulfill a contractual obligation not because he actually likes them  his playing is uneven uninspired awkward and generally disappointing  in addition the recording is harsh which makes it thoroughly unlistenable  the third movement of appassionata with its strange use of rubato and lack of momentum is particularly distasteful  i own recordings of these sonatas by brendel ashkenazy richter barenboim and frank and i recommend them all over horowitz|0
i absolutely loved the first chickenfoot album and wondered if their sophomore effort would live up to my expectations i can honestly say that chickenfoot iii has more than exceeded them iii has not left my cd player since the day of its release the songwriting is more solid the hooks grab you and never let go sammy mike joe and chad really come together as a unit on this album and you can tell they are more comfortable in their union now highlights are too many to count the negative for me is that there arent more tracks but thats because i cant get enough of chickenfoot cant wait for the next collection which at this point im guessing will be calledwhat chickenfoot v |1
i agree with quite a few others that almost all the songs here are generic sounding sammy hagar songs maybe something solo  not even the great guitar player can save these songs  the only song i like is the last one something gone wrong  and that describes the rest of this cd for me  i was really surprised by the first chickenfoot cd the songs were really catchy great hooks that had you stompin your foot  and im not even the biggest hagar fan i did like montrose and selective van hagar  but that first cd really nailed it and it was a surprise hit going gold  i just dont see the same thing happening here i dont think its going to catch on like the first one|0
gets better with every listen hes a standup guy too wellwritten and meticulously produced and performed the palimino melody is beautiful|1
basically a david gilmour solo effort this album lacks the thematic cohesion and lyrical ability of earlier floyd albums signs of life is a good introduction with its quiet ambient sounds and  learning to fly is one of my favourite floyd songs but the  rest of this album doesnt appeal to me because its so lame and uneven  terminal frost and a new machine part 12 are  pretty much filler on the turning away is very pathetic but  hollow sorrow is unlistenable for me because of this ugly  guitars david gilmour doesnt leave out a chance to trap into artrock  cliches stay away from this album and buy some of floyds 70s work|0
the tape did not workthis is the 2nd time ive replied to thishopefully this time i will get an answer and a new tape that works tnank yoi|0
rush was the first band i saw live back in the spring of 79 they changed the way i listened to music suffice it to say i have been a fan since then although i have not always been able to follow them so to speak they have gone some places i could not iethe whole synthdrenched phase in the 80sclockwork angels is the best album theyve done in years im not going to pick it apart trackbytrack and spoil the magic for anyone who has not yet heard it i will say that clockwork combines the best elements of both the classic and modern rush sounds on a concept album that tells a great story my personal faves if it matters are bu2b the anarchist halo effect wish them well and the garden but really the whole album is amazing if youre a rush fan not a single clunker on this one|1
a concept album a concept album oh yes let me repeat that a concept album when i heard that clockwork angels was going to be a concept album i felt a small shiver wiggle up spine i was excited at the good news concept albums are right smack in the wheelhouse of this band and its progressive heritage neil writes terrific stories and the boys set them to inspiring and demonstrative musical compositions to be honest all rush does is concept work lately they have been individual concept songs rather than full cohesive concept albums all rush songs are based on a particular concept and then endeavors to make that concept come to life now we have news of the twentieth rush studio album being a concept album the prospects were very promising given the bands newfound progressive roots strategy coupled with the extreme level of musical proficiency they have developed over their fortyyear career and now we toss in a classic neil peart penned concept this is one recipe for potential glorious amazementthe trick to a concept album is to make your concept real and visible throughout all the songs but not to the point where the individual songs can not stand on their own clockwork angels is the closest to perfection on this point i have ever heard each one of the songs on this album is a selfcontained chapter but still contributes to the larger story in a structured way we follow our protagonist from the point he leaves the family farm on his adventure through carnivals quests for lost cities run ins with pirates and shadowy anarchists figures all the way to the point in his life where he reflects back over his lifes trials and tribulations we learn about the protagonists point of view thoughts fears  and feelings about life himself and how to treat others the concept story is rich and full of adventure wonder and personal revelations there are just enough facts and key phrases to form a framework of a story within your head but then there is enough room to let your imagination run free to fill in the gaps to make your own personal adventure setting and characters this is exactly what a good novel does however rush accomplish this feat with a very few select words and phrases and then adds the musical elements which help to spur the imagery within your own imaginationneil draws on a number of literary and personal influences to help shape his story the wreckers is based on a story by alfred hitchcocks favorite author daphne du maurier the overall concept plot and more directly the song the garden is influenced by candide a novel by voltaire where a garden is used as an analogy for life freddie gruber the famed jazz drummer and teacher who recently passed inspired the lines and themes in headlong flight i wish i could do it all again these are just but a few of the literary influences woven into the fabric of this concept neil fits these famous and well storied works of literature into the world of the modern science fiction genre of steampunk the best way for me to help you visualize what steampunk is all about is to have you watch the recent sherlock holmes movies the ones with robert downey jr playing holmes the world is victorian in style but with modern twists brass leather and glass coupled with complex yet archaic gears power the rube goldberg style contraptions its an interesting genre and one that rush have chosen to use as a backdrop for this story neil expertly melds the future world driven by the rigid watchmaker along with these literary tales set to the dystopian world of steampunk and still reveals useful life lessons along the way coupled with ubervirtuoso musical performances and you now have  a 2012 version of a rush concept album that is mature provocative and weightythe stories the concepts the life lessons and the literature inspired the lyrics are all just gravy on the cupcakes its that signature music of rush that makes a rush album a rush album after a healthy fortyyear career these boys are masters of their individual instruments that is a given but to still be inspired to create like its your first album is what amazes me fresh melodies interesting compositions cool tones and some flatout jaw dropping technical fireworks litter this album from start to finish one characteristic of a rush song or album is that it takes more than one listen to fully understand and appreciate the song the music needs to breathe and age like a fine wine it gets better with time the more often you listen to a song the more you discover within that song subtle variations in rhythm melody andor arrangements of song sections continues to amaze and inspire i enjoy focusing on one instrument during a particular listen of a song and try to follow that instruments journey from start to finish then compare that to the other instruments it is a lot like three or four counting synths and keys instruments telling their own individual stories through variations in melody and rhythm but then all coming together in one intertwined amalgamation of sound that fits together in perfect lock step to achieve a singular purposei am not really that keen on ranking songs i can never get the list right with a rush album because songs shift in levels of enjoyment based my own perspectives moods or the particular outlook of the day i have however been able to group the songs on clockwork angels into four groups my individual groupings as of now are as followssongs in no particular ordertop group caravan carnies and headlong flightsecond group bu2b the wreckers and the gardenthird group clockwork angels the anarchist seven cities of gold and wish them wellfourth group halo effect bu2b2the music of rush is complex yet simple deep yet accessible it can be dark and it can be light emotions feelings scenarios tastes sights and smells are all present in the works it is a modern symphony of three in my opinion this album has all the elements i have described previously it is a complete package of lyrics music and concept spanning a variety of highs lows darks and lights it is a complete story with a beginning character development an adventurous middle a climax and a reflective ending all told with amazing musical performances in my opinion this is the best rush album yet to be produced is it moving pictures or hemispheres no it is not those are similarly fantastic works of art but clockwork angels has something one step farther the maturity of band members who have 55 plus years of life and 40 plus years of musical maturity under their collective belts to me those experiences and maturities are crucial elements in the depth and fabric of this album i felt those elements were present and growing in the past few albums but it has now come together with full force the progressive roots music the high quality concept and the knowledgeable direction of a true fan as a producer has elevated the overall atmosphere of this albumclockwork angels is the perfection as in highest degree of excellence of the fifth and most complete incarnation as in being or form of rushread more about it at theloftyoaksdotcom|1
lenny recorded this work three times  his radical rethink on dg done in the 1980s is an exercise in the most bizarre musicmaking  in that rendering of the score he stretches phrasing beyond the breaking  point and the interpretation is full of the most unusual idiosyncracies  this 1975 recording is a straightforward account and is not a  bad recording merely an uninspired one  every musician does  his job but thats all one can say about their playingits like reading  yesterdays newspapersokay but nothing new here  its a shame that  sony did not release bernsteins first 1958 recording of the fourth  he  had just taken over the reins of the philharmonic and this was one of the  first recordings of the stereo era  lenny had his troupe playing like 105  satans on hallucinogens and it was a visceral and very heady experience  that recording is probably the alltime best tchaikovsky fourth  as a  second choice abbado and the vienna is a stellar choice|0
not only is the music bad but the album is mislabelled  several unfortunate women taking my introductory dance class purchased this album since it was the only belly dance album available in local  stores  the cover art is different from that pictured above and showed a  middle eastern dancer  i can understand why they bought it  once upon a  time it snookered me in too but i promptly took the cd back for a  refund  production values are terrible and the music as if not bad  enough already has numerous dropouts and tape hiss  when i explained the  technical problems with the music shop manager he said hed never order  anything from that label again  apparently all their ethnic  music had the same shoddy production values and same shoddy  music  caveat emptor|0
this is another reggae album that is jacked up in price and is hard to find i got it for 10 it is a good collection but is not really something that should be so highly praised when there is plenty of groundbreaking lee perry backed productions to name that are greater  this is good but not great  buy it cheap than re sell it to one of these jerks who pay 200 for a cd|1

first off i was fully prepared to appreciate this album being relatively new to db longtime amon tobin fan currently diggin photekteebee and having respect for the rave reviews here  i guess i was caught really off guard by the super cheesy houseesque vocals and cheap synth instrumentation  i am hoping this is a highly specialized album for a niche group of musically impaired db listeners not the ultimate representation of its genre as its touted  i would be embarrassed to have this in my collection in the same way i would be embarrassed to have a kenny g album while considering myself a jazzhead  since when did shmooz become high art  this is antisoul for those who know the difference and care at least it makes my soul cringe  thanks for letting me share|0
we own a few of raffis dvds and this is a great way to take raffi with you on the road unfortunately we do not own or believe in owning a dvd player for the car so this makes for a great purchase for us my kids love music and i like to provide a variety for them of which raffi is part of that collection i highly recommend as it will bring fun entertainment for your kids|1
non of the singers are up to the challenge of their parts the orchestra on original instruments sounds dull and uninspired great opera but this recording does the music no justice|0
okay people listen here anyone who has ever listened to pink floyd before roger  waters left will know that their music was written to move inspire and enlighten the people listening to it if you read who has written the lyrics on the floyd albums you will see the name roger waters take a look now at the names on the so called new pink floyd albums those people arent even in the band gilmour had to call people to get lyrics from themi think that takes away all pink floyd has ever stood for their music ws pure and attracted a vast majority of people now their music is basic and blends with everything else which makes it boring and bland they needed a strong lyrical force and that person being roger waters was missing what makes me even madder isthe fact that pink floyd still plays songs written by roger even though they have no idea what the lyrics mean the wall was partially an autbiographical experience in rogers life and gilmour not liking him so much had no right to sing those songs as his own well thanks for listening and buy some quality floyd music|0

i thought this would be a thunderstorm recording with a lot of rain and waves etc but it has all these crickets chirping and its annoying i dont want to listen to bugs  besides for that it gets really loud and then soft i bought it to go to sleep by no way  some people would like this recording because it really sounds like nature but its too much nature for me|0

the wall is the greatest album of all timehope you like itthe end|1
this album is incredible the songs are some of the most catchiest ive ever heard personally my 3rd fav by them and im even reading the novel based off of it|1
given the reviews on this i am apparently alone in my dislike of this cd i just received it today and tried to listen to it however found myself needing to shut it off about half way through due to one repetitive annoying bird that chirped the same chirp like a broken recordthat being said i own 2 other cds by this company thunderstorm and ocean waves and they are excellent it was because i loved thunderstorm so much that i ordered ocean waves and morning songbirdsi still say this company makes great nature sound cds but im going to send this one back as simon would say  sorrykathleen m diehl author of the collective awakeningthe collective awakening messages along the path of awareness|0
as much as i hate geezer rock pink floyd has always stood out as a cut aboveyes this is probably the most pretentious album theyve ever made yes theres a fair amount of content that doesnt make very much sense if you havent seen the movie and yes this is nothing short of geniusyou know what the wall is stop reading pompous reviews that have already been written by hundreds of critics thousands of times in the past 27 years and buy it|1
this is my favourite pf cd along with dark sde and wish you were here and features one of the greatest rock songs ever written comfortably numb which is played by all rock bands in concerts inindiahighly recommendedfantastic|1

i purchased this set to use for relaxation and meditation the recordings are high quality and the 4 disc set is a bargain  the sleep disc put me to sleep and i woke refreshed  i also play it for my 2 year old when he is restless and it softly relaxes and put him to sleep for his nap  i have tried the different discs for the recommended relaxation and meditation  this set and the 4 disc nature sound set are excellent for taking that personal time to relax meditate and revive yourself|1
this album delivers ive only listened a few times and it is a bit different then the first release  not quite sure how to put it but it has a bit of a more mainstream sound a bit more mainstream rock orientedi love all these guys on their own but together they really raise the bar their sound on this one seems to be more sammy and michael anthony influenced than joe and chad  dont get me wrong joe makes his mark but mainly on the solos  the riffs sound like solo sammy all the waysummary nothing ground breaking other than 4 really strong musicians making some fun rock and roll music no incredible hits here but no slackers eitheri also have to add that when the first chickenfoot cd came out i figured it would be 45 years before we saw another one super excited that we only had to wait 2 years  hope they keep it going  there are not enough good rock bands aroundedit ive had this for a bit more time now and have given it a few more listens im bumping up my 4 star review to a 5 star review start to finish i think it is a bit stronger than the first record i passed on seeing them live on the last tour but plan on seeing them this go around just a bummer chad wont be with themstrong points alright  a bit lame on the guitar riff but a very likable singalong different devil  classic sammy if i didnt know better would say it was a solo sammy song up next  top rocker on this cd rivals get it up as chickenfoots most rocking song this will be killer live come closer  another classic sammy song with a nice bluesy guitar track from joe|1
ah rush fanship a sort of shared rite of passage among white nerdy outsider types who grew up in the 1980s or 90s we bond over how awesome moving pictures was and still listen to it through headphones every so often transported back to a time when the signal telling guys like us for we were mostly guys that we werent alone in the universe was coming from canada and contained instructions to rockto my high school self they were the one band that made music about serious things well them and u2 in a teenage wasteland of braindead jock rock pop cheezwhiz and low pants hiphop of course i learned as i grew older that there was other music worth listening to but faithfully continued to buy all of rushs new releases and to like most of them while still hoping that the next one would feature a little less of the alternative rock crunchy granola and a little more of the rocket sauce to e jack black that had made the classic stuff so addictivemaybe its the fact that geekiness is now in and you can openly play 2112 to your hearts content if not your girlfriends with your friends in guitar hero maybe its that no one wants to hear old guys trying to sound hip  in any case rush has decided that they might as well embrace the past kimonos and all and make another old school science fiction concept albumand man the result is the closest thing to classic rush since well classic rush this time they play with the considerable musical athleticism that they still bring to marathon concerts this time geddy lee doesnt try to do annoying extra things with his voice but delivers spoton vocals they make extensive use of strings echoing the lushness of several of their midcareer releases the energy of the songs reaches all the way back to the big laser show arena rock spirit of the early 1980s blissfully free of any pretenses at a currentsounding record not that anything current isnt a pastiche of things from the pasts garage sale and its fantasticamong the instant winners for me were bu2b whose driving doubleedged contemplation of the idea of an intelligentlydesigned universe speaks right to an excatholic rush fan like me clockwork angels whose soaring vocals martial drums and ethereal guitar are a strong echo of hemispheres the wreckers in which geddy delivers one of his most emotionallycharged vocal performances ever to a dramatic string backing and headlong flight simply a soaring allout rockerother songs offered up their rewards with repeated listenings the anarchist and carnies feature furious guitar work from alex and some theatrical atmospherics seven cities of gold constructs a winding wanderinginthewilderness vibe with some trippedout la villa strangiatosounding passages the garden is so achingly beautiful it overcomes somewhat cheesy lyricsis there sand in the aural picnic well isnt there always the song wish them well makes me marvel that a guy who is friends with the creators of south park and namedrops both voltaires candide and david foster wallaces infinite jest in another song can sometimes manage to crank out such preachy selfhelp pap the fragments of story in the liner booklet are somewhat of a disappointment too being kind of clunky and clichefilled then again peart emphasizes larger themes over plot detail in the actual songs so its not a big deal finally the recording sounds a bit muffled and flattened to my ears particularly the drums not vapor trails bad but not quite idealhardly fatal flaws though all in all i think this album will stand as a fine homage by rush to its own glory days containing plenty of blissout moments for longtime fans  and perhaps a few younger ones if its to be their last studio effort its an impressive final hurrah for a nowlegendary group|1
being a kathy troccili fan i still found it very difficult to get into this album  it is oversythesized and i am not sure what she is trying to accoplish  i guess it is good for the collector or die hard fan but for those of us who like her christian albums or the present this cd is very disappointing|0
the wall was my first pink floyd buy and still ranks 1 with wish you where here and dark side behind the the top 3there is nothing anyone can say that has not been this is a excellent double cd and worth every penny|1
went to the concert last year and had to get the cd prior to going  worth every penny  got the book and it tied all together nicely  neil peart is more than just a drummer and song writer  he is a true author of many books and they are all worth taking time to read  the cd is a must for any true rush collector  enjoy|1
the wall is truly an outstanding albumit was the first floyd album i ever boughtand when i first listened to iti did not really appreciate it at allhoweverit then grew on meand i discovered the idea behind the albmnow i think it is the greatest concept album of all timeeach number is brilliant in its own rightit contains true hits like comfortably numbrun like helland another brick in the walland also quick catchy tunes like the happiest days of our livesthe thin ice and goodbye blue skyroger waters is a geniusup their with the likes of lennon and mccartneyi wouldnt recommend this to be your first floyd album thoughprobably get dark side of the moonbut it is a must|1
my expectations were solid but not particularly high for clockwork angels a lifelong rush fan i enjoyed snakes and arrows but wondered if clockwork angels would merely be a continuation of the kinds of songs on snakes and arrows much to my amazement clockwork angels turned out to be one of rushs greatest albums the feel of the music is so livelike like live music and real the epic theme of the individuals struggle against conformity in pearts lyrics utterly gorgeous get this album and enjoy thank you rush for finally finding your groove again after so many years|1
i was misled this recording is not the soundtrack from the 1955 film the singers are totally different also the quality of the recording is poor|0
i went the extra mile to order the 2 lp set version of another incredible oddysey that is rush everything i like about this power trio was more than what i expected but then again the only expectations i have of this brilliant band is nothing but the best and this album delivers in spades i bought the cd version at target the same day i ordered the vinyl only because i couldnt wait for the vinyl in the mail for what its worth get the vinyl version so much deeper bass and presence the cd fails to deliver if youre a hardcore fan such as myself treat yourself to the 180 gram pressing plus you get a free mp3 digital download of the whole albumi cannot wait for the novelization of this great work lets hope these guys dont get ignored when the grammy people decide who should get the best rock albumcome to think of it who cares rush has never kowotwed to anybody theyre a band that continues to challenge themselves to dare the audience to take that similar journey with them cant wait for the tour|1
some music has filtered its way into our consciousness and has recceived so much exposure that we often forget just how good it is  pink floyds the wall is one of these after spending most of high school listening to it endlessly and hearing material from it on the radio through college i found myself burnt out on it  several years later having pretty much abandoned commercial radio im listening to the wall today for the first time in at least a couple yearswhat im amazed about is just how good it is  all the criticisms about it are largely true roger waters went off the deep end took the reins of the band totally and restructured their sound its selfindulgent the vocals are whiny you can go on  but one other thing is certainly true this is without a doubt the best work waters did as a composer and with the musical sensibilities of guitarist david gilmour to keep him somewhat in check its nothing short of brilliantthe albums story is pretty well known but for any new to it ill provide a brief summary  waters grew disgusted during a performance with a fan in the front row focused a performance filled with anger on that fan and eventually spat on him  after the show he declared the next time the band performed itd be behind a wall and this story of isolation madness somehow came to him  a boy named pink is born to a woman whose husband is away at war  the father dies another brick in the wall part 1 the boy ends up being raised by an overprotective mother mother and finds his creativity mocked and stifled in school the happiest days of our lives another brick in the wall part 2  this early section is somewhat autobiographical of waters childhood  the boy becomes a rock star but finds no happiness and indulges in the rock star life empty spaces fueled primarily by copious amounts of drugs and women young lust and has a nervous breakdown also biographical this time of band founder syd barrett  after a bit of time meditating on his life goodbye cruel world loneliness is there anybody out there an old pop singer vera and war bring the boys back home he gets drugged back to consciousness comfortably numb decides to inspire a riot in the flesh run like hell and completely loses his mind the trialok so its not exactly cheerly material but its powerful from delicate beauty the thin ice is there anybody out there the show must go on to slabs of raw rage another brick in the wall part 3 in the flesh to passionate hey you delicate and sad goodbye cruel world nobody home and totally indescribable the trial  my suggestion dont start at the beginning start on the second disc the first six songs are absolutely magicalis this for everyone  probably not but its a stunningly universal album given how bizarre its story is  weve all felt isolated at times weve all felt numb to the world weve all thought we were losing our minds at one point and we all wanted to lash out  this expresses those feelings as perfectly as aything ive ever heard  highly recommended|1
this cd was so great i had to buy this one to replace the older version which didnt come with the dvd that i wore out playing so much it came before its estimated delivery date which makes me happy packaged perfectly plays great i recommend this cddvd  for those just starting out getting into flyleaf awesome album with great songs|1
i just recently started listening to pink floyd  i had already heard songs like wish you were here and another brick in the wall part 2 on the radio but i never knew just how awesome pink floyd was until i heard shine on you crazy diamond  i am now hooked  i own wish you were here dark side of the moon and the wall  i think these albums are brilliant and i have never heard anything like them  i cant get enough of pink floyd  it makes me mad when people say that nobody listens to them anymore except old peoplethat is not true  there are plenty of people my age that listen to pink floyd  i really recommend this album and any other floyd album for that matter because they truly rock|1
this is a double audio cdlast recording with roger waters in the band  great music to listen to or sing along with |1
i loved raffi when we listened to his tapes back in the 90s when my brother was young just bought this cd for my 20 month old niece and she loves it|1
this is an absolute gem of an album which shows again that rock musics potential is not depleted yet hagar and satriani totally rock and achieve a fresh sound it just becomes painfully apparent how younger bands suck in musicianship and vocals compared to the music produced by the old school rockers|1
what strikes me most about this album is its lack of nervous playing  i love rushs music but there was always a sense that they were trying to prove themselves to us each other the world  with this album they seemed to have finally arrived at a welldeserved level of confidence in their skills one that comes across both in their performance and song writing  particularly with respect to the latter all of these tunes sound as if there was concerted effort to place their considerable chops at the service of the song  no one member outshines the other each is working together and with each other to create the best tune possible  this combination of confidence incredible playing teamwork and humility makes this a very special album  what a joy it is to hear the potential in ones favorite band be realized|1
i was dissapointed in the sabrina soundtrack  it was pretty much different variations on the same tune  not much variety  i was hoping for more music from the party scene|0
perlman spends his time in virtuosity but the issue is more with the orchestra where levins direction is totally neutral lifeless and even boring in some moments definitely try the grumiaux version oitrakh  emi or heifetz sony personnaly i like the power and fantastic sound  deployed by oitrakhs violin in all his records certainly the most  impressive this man had an incredible force in his arm to play so nicely  and he is unique heifetz sony is different and in the fourth and fifth  concerto so emotional that you listen the records everyday with the same  admiration and emotion then you realize why mozart was unique and also  why he deserves that artists make the effort at least to be lively when  playing his music and not monotone mozart violin concertos are  uncomparable and i would advise staying away from this record|0
its a must have if you like hard rock  a great band on cd and even better live  you wont be disappointed|1
i very was disappointed with this cd i thought i was getting a dvd i notice that there was not a large selection of sinbad standup|0
i like a few of the williams tracks such as giants eye with that trumpet passage thats later taken up by the flute hidden gun benefits from the electricpiano echoplex or whatever the heck it is but then those french horns come blasting in again to annoy the crap out of me theres too much empty frenchhorn blowhardism from williams courages score is actually preferable if only because its easier on the ear its dependably loaded with those courageesque chromatic brass descensions|0
fantastic unbelievable the sound and calibre of this band is still up there with the best   they sound better than ever i love listening to pearts drumming as im definitely a drum chick  married to a drummer makes me a little biased |1
i bought this cd in the uk it was the only recording i could find of civil war songs  sadly it fails on every count  the songs are arranged pretty much to death and most of the genuine feeling is replaced by a sort  of sickly sweet pathos  i know that the mormon tabernacle choir can do  better because i once had a tape called songs from the american  heartland or similar which was pretty good stuff  my advice  give  this one a miss|0
this set is a throwback  firstrate leaders doing mostly good tunes but in subpar sound often dispensible performances and with no discernable organization  as the sun sets on the compact disc and eu copyrights expire there are hundreds of superb jazz discs available at previously unheard of low prices especially box sets  there is no longer any reason to waste shelfspace or headspace on this set if ever there was|0
i have always loved listening to slash but when you combine his talent with myles kennedy  wow  this is some awesome music|1
compare raitts soliquoy on the decca selections cd to haydens on the london cast recording raitts operatic majesty masculinity laced with selfhatred and charismatic musicality jump out of my tinny little cd player michael hayden is  and i hate to criticize any performer  downright anemic by contrast as well as lacking utterly the pathos and complexity of raitts showstopping version the use of a real opera voice with raitt was a stroke of genius as it contrasts so deliciously and painfully with billy bigelows shortcomings of characteri cannot overstate this do not spend money on this london version suffice it to say it misses the point of the showi will continue to explore other versions as my love of and fascination with this show is endlessget the decca version  selections from the theatre guild musical play instead whatever its deficiences truncation mainly its emotional and aesthetic rewards are enormous and triumphant|0
cdcms fifth volume of computer music features works from the winham laboratory at princeton university named in memory of godfrey winham one of the pioneers of computer music in the 1960s this disc is subtitled inner voices supposedly because the works presented on it all help us to make out the inner voices in the sounds of the world around us strange then that the music on the disc features no realworld sounds whatsoever but uses rather either traditional musical instrumentation or else midi or computer synthesised sounds as its raw materialgenerally in fact one could say that much of what is presented here is precisely what might be expected from university academics presented with an expensive array of midi synthesisers and a computer or two to drive it all obtuse impenetrable works with little relevance to the world at large certainly many of the items here smack of having been interesting intellectual exercises which no doubt amused their composers during the compositional process but which dont really provide much lasting sustenance for listeners thereafterpaul lanskys justmoreidlechatter 1987 for instance is the second of a series of works created from vocal fragments and other similar computergenerated sounds stochastically assembled by computer program it consists of a babble of singing voices from which a listener constantly tries to deduce meaning but where in fact there is simply none to be found the works somewhat boppy but none the less complex series of rhythms and harmonic shifts although constantly evolving ultimately never actually make it anywhere the piece starts out quite amusing but i fear that by the end of its 9 minutes most listeners may just be left with the uneasy feeling that theyve been subjected to some sort of clever joke that they dont really understandit wouldnt be too bad if this was the only track like that but unfortunately most of the disc leaves me with very much the same feeling martin butler captures the essence of my misgivings in his sleeve note for his work night machines 1987 a work featuring a rambling collection of musical ideas for a small computercontrolled midi ensemble he writes the title is intended to suggest that the machines had as much to do with the musics creation as the composer did just so i feel that exactly the same could be said of most of the other works as well many feel cold mechanistic and devoid of emotion  just clever academic exercises of little lasting worth even their momentary stabs at humour seem oddly detachedwhen this disc was released a dozen or so years back midi synthesisers samplers and computer interfaces to drive them were fairly new and expensive and werent yet common additions to most teenagers bedrooms producing works like these was no doubt a fun and exciting thing to do probably at the time these pieces were felt to have some degree of artistic merit and while paul lanskys idle chatter pieces may have made it into the electroacoustic canon through their sheer novelty value im not sure that very much can now be said for most of the rest of this dischappily there is one sole and glorious exception to my criticisms and that is still life with piano 1989 by frances white this is easily the most substantial item on the disc  a comment that is not merely a reference to its 15minute duration the depth of emotion  to say nothing of sonorities  explored in this involved work for piano tape and live electronics is nothing short of extraordinary the tape part uses piano sounds which have been processed by computer to reveal through temporal and spectral manipulations undreamedof sonorities hidden within them indeed this is the one work that really lives up to the title of the disc truly exploring its own inner voice the real piano  played on this recording by jennifer tao and further altered in realtime through live electronic processing equipment operated by the composer herself  quietly rearticulates the material from which the tape was derived while the manipulated sounds plumb the depths of the sonic spectrum or else develop into large scale reverberating explorations of themselves the live pianist provides a more intimate and immediate perspective providing a welcome touch of humanity to an otherwise quite cold and sterile releasethe disc is worth having for this one track alone and if there were more like this on it i wouldnt hesitate to give this release the full five stars unfortunately|0
i remeber when i first read about the band i was intrigued and bought the album i think the album has its moments like the first 3 tracks but then after that it kind of goes downhillit just seems like the band gets stuck in a monotonous rythem and it just stays their in other words it gets boringif you wanna get hardcore by girls check out l7 they destroy this band the review below is mine i had done it anonymous first|0
oryema is one of a very small handful of artists that hail from uganda that can be had on cd and we are blessed for thathis unique introspective style is what makes this album as special as it is you can hear the intense melancholia and pain that he has endured in the lyrics including his exile from his homeland his yearnings for his land of anaka his attempts to soothe his widowed mother its all right there for the world to hearadd to his poignant vocals the additional help from both peter gabriel and brian eno whose studio textures add immensely to the songs he works on and the album is an instant gem the use of a few of these songs on the pure moods series of cds will hopefully help to enhance oryemas reputation as a master craftsman and songwritera wonderful lp|1
this is my least favorite pink floyd album they tried toohard to be mysterioso and wierd and floydianand they failedmiserably to ensure it was a pf album they designed thewierd cover the complicated and mysterioso album title andadded lots of sound effects and speech fragments for you cantreally have a floyd album without them and the dangeroussong titles like dogs of war aah im scared the songs themselves really dont grab me even tho dave gilmour is in goodvocal form and still shines on guitar the best song here isone slip i like that song i really dont remember how the second half sounds i dont listen to this album enough i likeddave gilmours solo albums better than thiswuufff some other observations i think its funnyhow they inserted the picture of rick wright inside especiallysince his photo didnt appear on the album originally also didyou notice how downbeat and depressing the two postwaters pinkfloyd albums have been waters was a great lyricist and broughtsome wit and humour to pink floyd two things that are absenton momentary and the division bell why are they so depressed|0
my family shared some sidesplitting laughter together as we spent part of an evening listening to this cd  with the exception of a few what the hells we enjoyed the content of this cd very much  laughter soothes and heals and we spent a good part of an hour laughing with each other  spelling rules will never be remembered without brians rhyme coming to mind|1
i had low expectations for this album but im such a fan a bought it anyway they play with spirit and passion but most of the material is not that great geddys vocal melodies are perfunctory for the most part and do not stand up on their own i think part of the problem here is that neils lyrics are also not very memorable so its tough to make a good vocal part from a lyric that reads like text there are not many memorable images to pull out here to stick in the listeners head some reviewers are blaming nick rs production i dont have a problem with sound quality its much better than the overwrought vapor trailsi was very happy to hear the song the wreckers to my ears this is the best track on the record there is a lot of heart on that track with a memorable chorus its my favorite song from them in quite a while but the 7 tracks before that left little impression still it is a strong bright spot on the album and i was happy for this momentary return to greatness if you have completely written off the album give that song another try the other track i really like is the last song the garden which breathes much better than most songs on the album its the biggest surprise here they really stretch out and build the song nicely the sparseness of the acoustic guitar and piano are very welcome after going through the rather incessant riff fest of the rest of the albumim grateful for the 2 good tracks on this album from my favorite band the rest of it is not bad but it is not great|0
its all here  my favorite pink floyd album twenty five years ago my favorite today  im happy to have it in my collection|1
im another longtime rush fan who found clockwork angels to be completely disappointing  i think the production of this cd left geddys vocals sounding completely flat and distant like hes on a hill 100 feet away from the rest of the band while recording is going on and without his dynamic voice giving life to the lyrics and everything else being mashed together to me its just one continuous boring bit of overly loud overly processed noise  if you want to hear the real rush buy anything else theyve released but this|0
another great album from the greatest band to not be in the hall of fame perhaps its because their canadian no doubt neil peart is the all time best rock n roll drummer|1
i personally believe that this is pink floyds best work  the story of a disillusioned rock stars creation of a psychological wall holds this album together nicely  roger waters personal connections with the songs heightens the drama and power  i think that a message about fame could be pieced together out of the songs but i recommend just enjoying the story and wonderful theatrical quality of this piece of art  tracks i really enjoyed include in the flesh young lust hey you nobody home run like hell and the trial  the only set back to the wall is that it is mostly written and sung by waters  while he is amazingly talented the rest of the band might have had some great ideas to add  i still loved it though  long live pink floyd|1
im so sick is probably my favorite song off of here but there are many other great songs to choose from this is a great hard rocking band with a lot of potential looking forward to their next album|1
i bought this particularly for the bartok cantata profana probably my all time favorite classical choral work  i was disappointed with mr shaws interpretation|0
we never heard of raffi with our son when i went looking for kiddie music for our little one now two we fell in love with these three cds even my son nine loves this music this is goto music in the morning to start their day highly recommend|1
i made a mistake of buying this cd without listening to it firstit has also five music in a cdi love to listen to tango especially la cumparsita  la paloma a media luzand love to dance tangovery sorry that tango zero hour is not my type of music and didnt impress me|0
sir malcom sargent cut his teeth in the pit for the doyly carte company based on the evidence here he spent the next thirty years forgetting everything he learned this mikado has the same problems that can be found  in most of his emi recordings and even the later doyly carte princess ida   it is simply too slow and too meticulous to give any sense of fun the  singers all give the impression that they are slumming and would rather be  doing fidelio the acoustic is annoyingly ambientgive this one a miss  and instead check out either mackerras on telarc or the excellent and  underrated doyly carte set on sony sargent is about as much fun as  sitting in a mud puddle on a cold afternoon|0
this is not rod mckuen reading these poems  he even says so in the insertit is a good friendname doesnt matter  sorry but i want the version i had on vinyl with rods sexy scratchy whiskey voice|0
wildly unbalanced volume levels also goes for londons pirates  patience takes all the enjoyment out of gs try  get another label dont buy these three unless you  are good at holding your nose i was very disappointed at the overall  production quality|0
we had this album as a cassette taped off of an lp when i was little and i was so excited to find it still available as a cd for my nephew after his mother had played an incredibly tweenaff and indescribably dull cd of baby songs on loop it was an enormous relief for me and my nephew to have something funny lively catchy and intelligent to listen to babies love the bouncy rhythms and older children will benefit from the valuable messages of love tolerance and an appreciation of multiculturalism and diversity that come through incredibly singable songs for kids and fantastic value with 3 cds a must|1
titanic what more can i say for you not to listent to it|0
i wish i had seen this title on amazoncom before i bought it somewhere elsefor a lot more money  curious about this particular series of nature recordings i bought the sampler disc to see what they were like  i  wont be buying morethis particular series of nature sound discs  includes a wide variety of titles the sampler presents a few minutes of  each  the sound quality on the various tracks ranges from very good to  almost unlistenable  the disc includes no track listing that corresponds  to the discs content so you cant always match the sounds you are hearing  to the track title  sometimes its obvious what the sounds are sometimes  its not especially on those tracks where the production quality is  lackingas a collector of naturethemed cds i can say with confidence  that if you are curious about the sounds of nature series you  might want to buy this disc before investing in a lot of titles from this  catalog  quality control is very shaky on these productions  if you are  on a budget but like these nature sound discs check out the echoes  of nature series available in boxed sets under the title the  natural sounds of the wilderness  these are very inexpensive but  have much better production values and beautifully clear sound quality|0
i was very disappointed and really wanted to return it  the recording does not sound like a harpsichord but rather like an organ|0
i purchased this directly from amazon but had read reviews here  unfortunately i misinterpreted the reviewer who said ritas own voice was unappreciated by columbia who used dubbers  i thought this cd would have ritas own voice but was disappointed  im returning it unopened as i can hear the same in her movies and at least see her dancingand skilled lipsyncing  the notes on the cd say while the voice in most cases belongs to other singers the spirit and personality conveyed is hers alone  that could only happen if one imagines rita performing while listening  id rather watch the movies|0
yes yes i love these pieces by faureacute too  however john georgiadis conducting is so slow and dirgelike that they lose all their spontaneity and appeal to me  he drags the prelude to pelleacuteas  meacutelisande out to nearly 7 minutes 656 when the delightful old record im replacing did it in 527  fortunately he didnt conduct everything on this cd  now i need to buy another recording  arrgghh|0
as with miles davis it seems if sun ra found special solace in performing live late in his career though severe health problems had begun to rob him of his incredible giftsin what was scheduled to be a gig by tenor saxophonist john gilmore and his group sun ra sits in and plays a supporting role by adding wonderful textures on his synthesizer the band  chris anderson piano bruce edwards guitar and a rhythm section of john ore and buster smith  is in outstanding form and shapes the music through the guidance from sun raclocking in at nearly 65 minutes this is sun ra giving everything he has for the musicians and the audience the legend lives through his stage presence|1
i wanted a recording of these piano concertos to replace my lp of serkin with the chicago symphony george szell conducting and i ended up with this one i have to say that i cant believe the excellent ratings it is getting from so many people  the fortes are too loud and it sounds like he is just banging on the piano and sometimes the loud passages are actually sloppy  there is no warmth or sensitivity to the playing which i feel is essential for brahms  the slow tempos are plodding and seem to drag down the movement of the music there are a few moments where the tone is beautiful but there is no consistent beauty throughout  these are pieces that i am very fond of and after giving it one more try today i just took the cd off the player and will be looking for another version of these pieces  any suggestions|0
its music that is played all day long in our home  my children broadcasts movie masterpieces at top volume one can hear it at every corner of the house  today my fouryear old dragged his little lego cd player and gently parked it beside the grand piano he came running in to ask me where the middle c is on the piano ran back out positioned himself on the piano bench turned on david glen hatchs movie masterpieces and started to copy the playing on the piano  he knows the title of every piece and has his personal favorite  titanic theme  it was at that moment that i felt an overwhelming need to post this review  music so beautifully delivered so as to touch and inspire the heart of a child deserves gratitude and recognition  thank you thank you thank you|1
chickenfoot 111 takes off where it last was with the first cd i read that joe challenged sammy to sing like he never did before but i dont hear any change in his vocals not bad just no difference in his style and sammy did the same with joe to play things unexplored and i dont hear anything different but joe still is badd real badd plays his ass off so hes just fine chad and mike are just fine as well but i dont like the lyricswho writes them on some of the songs but overall great collection of songs  i like song 11they lied about this one they lied about that onenice tune bye yall|1
clockwork angels is rushs best album since power windows and the garden is their best song since time stand still  lifelong rush fans agree that even bad rush is better than 90 of what else is out there  this is an album recorded by the band before during and after seriously chugging along on their most successful tourrush time machine 2011  live in cleveland in synch and with musical chops freshly honed and intact  the concept is bold  in some ways this is rushs most ambitious album ever  even 2112 was just one side of an album  here the concept holds troughout the entire cd  also however the songs can stand alone just finethis is neil pearts most personal album lyrically  finally we get an entire album closer to his heart instead of those rare glimpses of his soul he would give us on songs like afterimage from grace under pressure or cold fire from counterparts  these lyrics are similar to his personal writings from his grief journalghost rider travels on the healing roadand his travelogue bookfar and away a prize every time  ultimately i feel that this album is a musical journey through grief that sense of loss or count of cost and the grieving process which neil has personally survived and lived to tell  when he says watch out because sometimes the target is you it sounds like it was written by someone who has felt that way perhaps after losing a spouse and a child in the same year  very ouch  very realultimately that makes this coming of age tale from the perspective of an old man looking back over his life not unlike the fountains of lamneth by the way clearly rushs most emotionally mature work  it will inspire you reread voltaires candide andrew marvells to his coy mistress and swifts gullivers travels  it will touch your heart  it will make you drink red wine and read hegel and google thesis antithesis synthesis  it will make you appreciate the musical genius of lee and lifeson and peart as one miraculous entity of its own while at the same time you will bask and bathe in the joy of the lyrical gifts that neil also possesses  it will make you ask yourself how so much good got into one band  remember when you first heard rush  how did 3 guys make this music  how do they play that  get ready to feel that sense of wonder again  one more thing  rocknroll hall of fame you are a joke until you put rush in and formally apologize  i officially boycott you until then  not a visit  not a dvd purchase  you are dead to me|1
by the time 1979 had come pink floyd had a tremendous string of incredible albums throughout the 70s roger waters slowly formed the band or tried to into his band both streaks climaxed here the wall is an incredible album that is based upon the character pink who loses his father in wwii and grows up to be a mentally unstable rock star as an adult waters writes some of his best lyrics here and there is incredible music to convey the lyrics to the listener waters conveys fear paranoia and general insanity to the listener through pinks travels from a fearful childhood to his trip into paranoid isolation brought upon him by his protective mother suppressive schoolteacher and overbearing wife they lead him to build a wall around himself to protect him and his fragile psyche from the outside it really is incredible as both a conceptual piece and as rock music the true substance of this work has made it into on of rocks most celebrated releases and showed the true talent of roger waters and of pink floyd even though the other members had less input then before|1
very smooth flowing music great for practicing tai chi provides atmosphere and a soothing background helps to focus on your moves|1
plain and simple the wall is not for everyone  roger waters had two ideas for the next pink floyd album after animals  one of them was about a series of dreams roger experienced which would later become the first of  his solo albums the pros and cons of hitchiking and the other was  about a rock star building a wall of isolation from the outside world  needless to say the wall was chosen and became one of pink floyds best  known works  from the opening track in the flesh to the end outside the  wall this album never ceases to amaze me  there is so much emotion  within these songs its hard to convey with writing  the thin  ice mother and nobody home are perfect  examples of this  comfortably numb remains one of the greatest  pink floyd songs with one of the most emotional guitar solos from david  abitw part 2 young lust and run like  hell are also great songs  however as i mentioned earlier this  album will not appeal to everyone  the album is intended to be listened to  all the way through so if youre a person who cant sit still for any  length of time this is not for you  this isnt mainstream pop music  like many pink floyd albums this will make you think and reflect on many  occurences in your life  albums such as this are very few and far  between  i suggest that you give it a try|1
the first three tracks are pretty much ambient  the album has a very modern atonal feel about it so it probably was ahead of its time  but it seems to me there is a lot of this kind of spacey jazz around now and this one just isnt going to get the nod|0
while there are a few scattered good songs on this album it has too little involvement by other members of the band while i agree that roger waters was clearly the stronger lyricist vs gilmour the band performs the best when all members are involved in the writing in addition i think the musical quality is better when gilmour writes solo as opposed to waters waters never got over the death of his father in wwii and this album simply describes his feelings and the war itself he puts emotion into it but the writing quality itself is weak he focuses too much on himself and not the band|0
im a huge rhcp fan but even i could skip this one with a ripped off 70s funk beat and back up singers to complete the sound this song wouldnt have even made the cut on freaky styley which was a 70s funk style album this one is only for die hard fans that just have to have every rhcp song|0
this was my introduction to prewar calypso together with the book by the same name now regretfully out of print i have since bought several collections the ones from rounder records and a few others but this is still my favorite even if it is a bit uneven some of the instrumantals are of quite low fidelity and therefore less enjoyable but the the good ones are some of the greatest examples of prewar calypso availiable on cdyaraba shango by the growling tiger and the lajobless by the lord executor are two wonderful examples of dramatic minorkey storytelling songs the recording of lionel belascos piano solo trinidad carnival is a modernday transcription of a unique piano roll its fun to listen to the lort invaders version of the song he claims was stolen from him rum and coca cola even if the performance of the song here is a bit ragged my favorite part of that recording is the introduction that song which has the world upset rum and coca cola  in the way it was intended to be sung in other words not like the andrews sisters did it other good ones lis camille and uncle jo gimme mo by the underrated in some quarters wilmouth houdini and a couple of othersi would rate this cd a 5 for these tracks alone but some of the instrumentals are not quite on that level|1
purchased this music for my granddaughter  this is the music my children were rasied with and it will be my first granddaughter may hours of enterainment|1
yup great music for a tai chi class oh yea you must be one with the music and the chi |1
unidiomatic lethargic and not recommended  obviously most of the people reading the reviews look for their own pov to be corroborated rather than serious criticism  as a result the detailed review by the man in a hathaway is dissed and anodyne treacle about this being a great recording is widely applauded welcome to democracy in action where the lowest common denominator prevailsin any event this is really an embarrassing disc perhaps arrau did better later and if you think this is great then you should simply ignore the readings of selected etudes by the likes of richter and horowitz and the best complete sets those by ohlsson and ashkenazy  if you like distorted accents lumpen phrasing clumsy technique  you will certainly find many of those grotesqueries here  i think it very likely based on the overwhelming evidence left behind by chopins contemporaries that the composer would have been startled  to say the least  by this elephantine effort|0
best remastery i have ever heard on one of the most groundbreaking records ever what ele can i say|1
this recording of la tarviata has c studer who must compete with callas live recording and with sills sutherland caballe scotto etc and  she does not win the race with any of the othersit is a shamblesit is still a mystery how cheryl studer made it to this class of recording with these other artists and also recorded many many other operas that were denied to other greater singers like aprile millo and renee fleming complete operasthis is terrible singing by studer and pavarotti cannot get past her he sort of gives up throws in the towel as it were pons can manage but levine is lost in the vocal mess studer sings this opera like an operetta written by lehar and even at that badly she ducks high notes that are not high cs or e flats she covers her voice with old techniques used by bad singers for years her coloratura is forced echolike enlarged with equalizers and sonic tricks so i have heardshe sings this way on every recording sometimes way off pitch as in the william tell lucia rigoletto elektra die frau ohne schatten semiramide and on and onmoffos notorious thais is better than thisi cannot believe james levine pavarotti and domingo conducted sang with her continuously she was booed off the stages at la scala and vienna i heard her live in w tell in milan and it was a frightening experience scooping swooping singing falsetto all of the time finally katia ricciarelli came to the rescue when studer bowed deeply during act i and left the stage to wild applause ricciarelli saved the entire night with her ontarget brilliant singingbut you can decide on thislisten to it and then return it you will buy maria callas sills etc it has a camp flavor to it|0
brian regan is one of the most underrated comics going  here is his 1997 cd  brian regan live  great ones here include stupid in school monster truck drivers reminds me of myself  seatbelts spider webs and bees just great elevator and faces and evel knievel  great stuff all the way through|1
i bought this disk as a cheap backup to my sacd version but sadly the pressing is apparently defectivethe top track on this disk is garbled  no scratches just garbled recording as in a bad pressing  no visible defect but the same track wont play properly on any of my cd sacd or dvd players|0
this cd is alright back in the ussr is pretty good the cd is all over the place and pretty self indulgent on the part of paul mccartney this is definately the beatles on their decline|0
this is great for people that suffer from insomnia  if you want to hear to a great instrumental soundtrack listen to the on from the movie the big blue|0
i bought this to listen to with my 3 year old grandson  we love it  so easy to sing to and great music  it is a lot of fun|1
i had to listen many times but once i did these songs grabbed me clockwork angels the wreckers caravan bu2b the anarchist 7 cities of gold the gardenafter watching the dvds ya cant help but like these guys|1
generally you either love rush or hate them for whatever reason some people dont get them of the quality and variety of their work so be itbutif you want to see what 38 years of musicianship craftsmanship and striving to be better gets you in the world of rock i can think of no better illustration than clockwork angels it is singularly their best work and i dare say better even than 2112 from the opening chords of caravan which pushes you into the intriguing and introspective steampunk world of the album feeling the steady thrum of geddys bass counterpointed with the thunder of neils drums and overlain with the siren song of alexs guitar right through the final dying plaintive notes of the garden you are wrapped up and enthralled in a sonic exploration of an amazing and vibrant worldwhat is even better is that while each and every song glues this world together taking any one song out of the context of the album does not diminish them but opens them even more relevant interpretation in todays society this multitextural form of music is simply astonishing to feel rolling through your mind with every beat punch and jamand to top it off the band does something it may not have done since the days of fly by night or caress of steel  the band cuts loose at once the most proficient purveyors and players of their instruments in all of musicdom the band seems to feel enough freedom joy and above all confidence to pour themselves into every song with a barelycontained reckless abandon that makes it sound like they are a band of twentysomethings fresh to the circuit againif you are looking for rockandroll that rocks thunders jams and impresses you could do far worse than clockwork angels rush has built a masterpiece for the 21st century|1
this session was recorded in 1977 in new york its the reunion of two old friends hampton and gordon gordon started with lionels band when he was just 18 and from that moment on after an anfractuous career being both the star and the forsaken of sax tenors he rejoined for one day the old master sharing both their respective knowledgesfrom the musical point of view both men have a solid escort id mention especially the great guitarist bucky pizzirellithe record is not a masterpiece but its funny and worth to enjoyso please enjoy|1
we love and value the written word culturallyme too im a dedicated book lover but when it comes to learn about folk magic books can often be limiting folk magic traditions around the world exist with more vitality in orally told stories and poems in art work if you know where to look and what to look for in legend and myth and in music and this is why cat yronwodes hoodoo jukebox is such a delightful compilation first off if you like blues music then its just an awesome album my husband does not share my interest in folk magic but he is a jazz musician and we love listening to the music together secondly if you are at all interested in learning more about hoodoo and conjure the folk magic traditions of the regional us south and beyond then this album is essential listening you will hear stories about root women and conjure doctors consulted about all types of matters and concerns and in many cases a specific magical act is described excellent listening excellent information and a truly invaluable resource to your magical library|1
i was looking for an adultfriendly as in not just for kids chanukah cd that measured up to the warmth of christmas carols this cd did that i love it|1
bought this for our step granddaughters boyfriend at christmas 2012 that is a lead guitarist and can jam pretty good we though hed like to have a little slash around|1
the two reviews theat say this cd is the first album by the band neu are wrong the other review is correct this is not the krautrock classic i believe that it is actually under copyright control and is only available  as a pirate which is a shame because it is one of the finest pieces of  elctronic music ever made zenlike in its magnificence when they make a  film of my life the opening track from neu will be used to theme the  tantric sex virginity loss scene it is tranquil sensuous and  lifealtering and lasts for 10 minutes  if only but like i said this  cd here is not it so keep looking|0
rush just keeps getting better most bands cant put material like this out let alone after 35 years if youre new to rush get this album if youre not new to rush you already have this album|1
pretty funny i especially liked the part about the whale research ill leave it at that so i dont spoil it|1
im sorry to those people who really loved the soundtrack but i did the  show with some really great people and we could have wiped the floor with  the broadway people the music is still great and i love the storyline but  jeez couldnt they have cast the show better kim|0
2 12in my search to devour all things progressive pendragon came highly recommended though ended up being just another watered down incarnation in the myriad of genesis and yes with a little floyd thrown in for good measure derivatives multiplying at alarming rates and consequently extinguishing fans passion for the craft they initially fell in love with although the live show itself is spoton nothing really distinguishes investing in the nonstudio output as do the songs themselves while being textbook pleasing in a dumbeddown modprog context rarely distinguish over similar fare although to their credit once vocaldriven duties are paid they do know how to close out a song in epically beautiful fashion and finally make listeners at home enviable of the live experience|0
pedro messone was my reason for ordering the cd however the 1st song si van para chile was of very poor quality soundwise  i guess  id have to describe the sound as warbly  the remainder of the  cd was adequate but not necessarily on a par with others ive bought from  amazoncom|0
as a kathy troccoli fan she definitly know how to touch one heart and soul and with love and mercy this album does not dissapoint from the upbeat tempos of love one another and call out to me from the heartfelt songs of water into wine and a babys prayer the songs in this album will definitly be pleasing to fans of all ages|1
well in the face of all these 10s ijust have to chime in with a dissenting opinion  frankly i thinkthe soundtrack is pure unadulteratedcrap  bad writing bad synthesizervoices but what else is new fromhorner  but this is a typical reaction when people fall in love witha film  happened with somewhere intime happened with out of africa only the big difference is that thosefilms had good scores by john barrybut who am i to argue with the numberone selling album in the countryjust goes to show you  end|0
i love the mix of traditional christmas with new and soverywelldone pieces michael w smith is a master at this|1
michael w smith is one of my favorite artists which somehow allows me to be more critical than i would of artists with whom i am less familiar  when stacked against the entirety of his many albums this one is good but not great  the overwhelmingly articial sound of the synthesizer provides such a dated sound of the 80s and not in a good way  and several of the songs particularly friends are overdone and ultimately rather cheesynonetheless it is neat to experience the beginning of smith as he begins to establish his niche  and you can see the songwriting chops that later produced some of the greatest works to come out of the contemporary christian genre  could he be the messiah and be strong and courageous are both full of energy and lots of fun  near the end it is fun to sing along to great is the lord a favorite praise chorus across the world for over 20 yearsthough i would recommend some of his later work especially i 2eye and ill lead you home more highly this is an album worth hearing|1
joe satriani is capable of much more  i think this album along with the first one proves that joe just cant write actual rock songs outside of his solo stuff that are more than just mediocre  everything is just so bland and average  i wish he would go back to doing surfing with the alien type music  he was so great and inspired back then  anyway i know people here dont like the comparison but the new van halen album a different kind of truth absolutely destroys this waste of time  i hope cf changes things a lot for their next album  i will keep buying them but im starting to lose faith that they will come out with anything decent in their current form  i do think however the drummer is really good and that shows on this album|0
this is not a valid representation of english ballads or folk songs  the songs are repetitive and the vocals are flat week and uncompelling  the playing is fair at best  used copies are being sold for over 40time for me to sell my copy on ebay  i like ambient mellow spaced out gothic materialbut this is just week  if youre thinking of getting this for another version of long lankinrun away now and seek out steeleye spans commoners crown for a much better take on the ballad|0
this classic album from one of the greatest bands of all time is pure genius they manage to combine amazing music and a beautiful story together perfectly the lyrics are practically poetry especially on outside  the wall i consider this album to be up there with the beach boys  pet sounds and the beatles rubber soul great tunes often overlooked  one of my turns and nobody home a must have for anyone  who really loves good meaningfull music|1
this is my second coopy and although better still not good it sounds like snap crackle and pop cereal dont buy it|0
my system merlin tsmmxr speakers on loaded skylan stands manley stingray ii tube amp rega dac fed by mac mini running pure music standalone cdp is an oppo all cables are cardas and subwoofer is mj acoustics 150 mkii this is a reasonably high end system highly resolving with excellent tonal balance and continous response the system is in a dedicated listening room and it is powered by its own power leg in my homei ordered the 2009 abbey road remastered cd which is one of my favorite albums of all timeyikes it sounds louder almost as if the midbands have been pushed too far gone is the articulation of bass i recall and the layering is hard to hear when things sound so harsh and i mean very harsh my system is manley stingray running merlin tsmmxrs which is a very sweet sounding rigi was so worried i rebiased the amp but it was within range and abbey road did not sound very good so i went upstairs and tried abbey road on my little martin logan motion 4s with the dynamo sub and denon amp it sounded thinner but still pretty bad i recall abbey road sounding better on my creek amp and wharfdale diamonds or heybrook hb1s of years agoi threw on stompin at the savoy with ella and armstrong and all was well smooth balanced and just terrific sounding in fact everything else sounds great including my beatles love cd but abbey road is terrible i called up a buddy and he confirms that his boxed set was sold off because it was terrible sounding hes running revel m20s with parasound powerso whats with so many great reviews of these cds and the digital remaster i did find very detailed reviews agreeing with what i heard not many but i am clearly in the minority but after trying the cd on two systems sounds awful in the car as well i think a lot of people dont know what proper mastering sounds like or the lack the gear to explore the detailscapt rb|0
sammy and the boys strike again im really enjoying this cd it is more polished than their first outing or maybe its just that the guys have grown closer knit and more comfortable with each other either way all of these guys despite their age are some of the best in the business and are having fun showing that they still have the stuff there is some really good rocking going on here no doubt about it this release is much better than 97 of whats been released in the genre so far this year and chickenfoot are making their mark these guys are probably the most sucessfull  super group  yet to date sammys great voice is still in form despite his age and he still is feeling his youth noone can argue with joes guitar playing  hes allways been one of the best mikey shows that he can harmonize and is still pounding that bass  while chad  well cudos to him i believe that he is really now getting to show just how talented that he is on drums so smooth and effortlessly lookinggo chickenfoot   no sophmore slump here|1
the wall is one of the grandest moments in rock n roll history  if you are a true fan of rock n roll you must have this one in your collectionalong with dark side of the moon  the wall was a grand concept by roger waters carried out to perfection  it contains some of the greatest songs in historyanother brick in the wall hey you comfortably numb run like hell etc  long live pink floyd  theyre one of the top 3 or 4 bands of alltime|1
an absolutly great cdbrian regan talks about everyday things we can all relate to  but in the funniest way without one curse word he recalls terrible moments like when he as a women when the baby was due but she wasnt pregnant and confusing ones a a child out in right field waiting for the game to end so he can get a snow conemy friends and i discovered brian a few years ago  to this day we are still ing his lines  you tooyou will not be disappointed if you purchase this cd|1
upon first listen i was a little skeptical  with the exception of a couple of songs i just didnt get it  then i reminded myself that i have this reaction to almost every new rush record ive bought since becoming a fan in 1984  however upon repeated listeings the songs have grown on me and i believe this album may be one of their bestthe first 9 songs are all excellent and the final 3 are good to very goodi like this album a lot more than all albums since counterparts  i just cant get enough of it i listen to it straight through then i listen to it again  since buying it 3 weeks ago i have listened to nothing else  the songs get better and better|1
i discovered christines music after first discovering cheryl wheeler a singer with a similar type of appeal both are singersongwriters who can write about serious topics when they choose to yet they each have a great sense of humor although this particular album seems mostly serious sometimes tragic to me christine provides extensive liner notes about the songs as well as lyrics for themchristine wrote all the songs here except downtown which is a cover of the sixties pop classic while lacking the energy of the original it is one of the more interesting covers of this song christine sings it as a duet with livingston taylor in the liner notes christine goes into great detail about her idea for a video version of the song in which she is a poor unfortunate who gets mugged while livingston is a bighearted cab driver who comes to her rescue i do not know if this video ever got made but i enjoy their interpretation of the songthe title track is amusing though im surprised at the lyrics it seems that christine is doing all the things that her man likes but she hates yet convincing him that she likes them anyway in an age when women sing about their independence this song goes against the grain still im not complaining the other amusing song is mysterious woman in the liner notes christine explains that shell never be mysterious because she talks too much another cheerful though not funny song is santa monica pier  a song simply about having a good timethis set includes several sad songs including realities about a breaking relationship 85 contrasting the pleasures of miami beach with the loneliness of one individual who lives there never go back wishing it were possible to go back but knowing it isnt somebodys baby about homeless people and aint love grand about an old woman who never bothered with love when she was young but wished she hadif you are looking for humor this is not the album to buy this shows mostly the serious side of christines music if you enjoy singersongwriters in contemporary folk music christine is definitely worth listening to|1
i bought this as my first michael w smith recording  very disappointed  the sound is very dated  sounds like richard marx meets st elmos fire  if this is your first foray into mws get something more recent|0
its odd how the original score to back to the future took 25 years to be released while the inferior score to part ii came out along with the movie the film my favorite of the trilogy is very dark and complex and the album reflects that which makes for a hardly joyous listening experience the upbeat tempo and sense of adventure from the first film is gone and in its place is a lot menace and oppression represented musically by a lot of lowkey underscoring which doesnt stand well on its owni bought the cd on boxing day 1994 and i swear it must have been in my cd player maybe 4 or 5 times i just could never get into it outside of the opening and closing titles theres little to recommend about silvestris score to part iithe production design of this mca album is just horrible a very lazy effort indeed no thought was put into this release at all and its just a quick moneygrab universal could have scored huge pun intended if they released the original but we had to wait until 2010 when intrada would do it insteada cheap wasted opportunity and an overall unenjoyable scoremca album track listing1 main title2 the future3 hoverboard chase4 a flying delorean5 my father6 alterate 19857 if they ever did8 pair odocs9 the book10 tunnel chase11 burn the book12 western union13 end titletotal time 4445complete score track listing unreleased1 prologue 2252 main titleflying traffic 3163 the future 5214 griff 0245 hoverboard chase 2476 a flying delorean 4007 marlene mcfly 0488 hilldale 1329 needles deal 03010 leaving 2015 22111 hell valley 13112 marty wakes up 04013 my father 20214 alternate 1985 30215 grays sports almanac 01916 if they ever didsomething inconspicuous 51217 biffs garage 25118 the weather experiment 02419 pair o docs 12520 the book 44621 martys temper 02622 tunnel chase 51923 burn the book 22324 docs gone 04125 western union 15126 im backto be concluded 05527 back to the future part iii trailer 05528 end credits 435|0
while this guy doesnt fall into a number of traps race relationships controversy that other comdedians get into he does fall into one particular one thats inexcusablehes so broad that he misses any humor whatsoever  he tries to play the rubberface routine he fails this time because its on cd and his annoying pedestrian observations have to be taken without the physicality  its stupid silly humor disguised as wittily observed but its not really witty  stupid silly can be really funny but since he fails it just comes off as dumb  since this cd came out i have watched him numerous times on tv with various comedy central specials thinking his material would change and get betterit doesnt  hes so unfunny that i cant even remember his lines to tell other people in order to stay away  while not necessesarily a family comedian he is very clean and in that i see a very large appealit just doesnt make him good  even jeff dunham is better than this guy because hes funny but i have issue with the fact that he hides behind the figures with his frequently banal and obvious jokes while it is his improvisational abilities that make hime funny  try intelligent comedians who have something to say like todd barry jake johanssen mike birbiglia steven wrightgeorge carlin patton oswalt who ironically thinks regans great doug benson and countless others who havent released cds or dvds  while it doesnt have to be intelligent to be good it isnt regan if its good and its an insult to the creative mind and comedy that hes so well thought of in standup when he should have sat down long ago or been reprimanded by his parents to close his mouth|0
i have been a rush fan since moving pictures and have enjoyed many of their albums since then but this one i cant stop listening to it  i believe it is because of the thematic concept elements evident in this record  someone recommended listening to it in sequence and i agree with that 100  its like a story reminiscent of 2112 and for some reason to me analog kid from signals as a high school graduate awaiting college to start i remember when i leave i dont know what im hoping to find and when i leave i dont know what im leaving behind  and now 30 years later with a family and midcareer  wondering whats next  in a world where i feel so small i cant stop thinking big  it even inspired me to go back and read anthem by ayn randlike 2112 theres no individual instrumental track on this one  i guess some of the songs have pretty lengthy instrumental sections and thats just fine  alexs acoustic parts are terrific and geddys work on bass wow  lets just say if they measure notes played per instrument per song i think geddy wins this one and neil well what can i say  i cant even airdrum to keep up with himthis album is actually about something  even the artwork is fabulous  rush really knocks this one out of the park|1
i chose this rating as one side of the tape is not good  the sound is terrible and i can not understand the songs|0
how can you not like this cdi have this cd and its pfs 2nd cd this is a rock opera about a young man named pink and he goes thru lifes toughest situations there are great songsaplenty my fave songs are one of my turns another brick in the wall all parts the happiest days of our lives and comfortably numbthis was not as good as dsotm but only by a hair the movies also good and the subliminal message in empty spaces is very bonechillingany floyd fan must have this|1
i love wish you were here this recording is the best but it should cost ony 20 not 32  40  nothing in the package justifies this|0
while i like rush a lot and have just about everything theyve done i kind of get embarrassed by some of the reviews that are written they border on the irrationally fanatical rush is a rock band not some divine force through which the words of divine beings are transmittedhaving said that they are one hell of a rock band and this album proves it these guys are pushing sixty and have more musical imagination energy and technical skill than all but a handful of the rock greats throughout time each member is a virtuoso on his instrument were defining geddy lees instrument as the bass of course not the keys although hes no slouch on those either i never really liked his voice as much when it was shrill and shrieking but now its come down a bit with the ages he sounds really really good lyricallywell we know that neil peart is an articulate man his lyrics are always thoughtful and worth listening hard to he is a good lyricist but he is a great drummer his drums should be the focus of your attention and alex lifeson does something that most guitarists cant  he plays with skill fire and soul while at no time trying to draw attention to himself as the guitarist he plays for the song every time the other guys do too of course but given that how most people focus more on guitar than on bass or drums it takes a lot of maturity to play the way lifeson does it is rare to hear a rush song and say wow listen to that guitar rather one says wow listen to this song thats what happens when 3 masters keep their egos in check and play togetherpertaining to this album in particular i have to go with the wreckers as a standout melodically great a marvelous chorus and an interesting set of lyrics headlong flight is an example of how they can still pump out some serious energy and as others have said this song in particular sounds like a nod to the early albums the last track the garden is musically very pretty but i dont feel that its the revelatory masterpiece that some do its good because its different its not a typical rush song and because of that it catches the attentionas has been said though this is an album first and foremost and demands to be listened to as such while everyone will have his or her personal favourite tracks rush designed this to be taken in as a whole deeply unfashionable when you consider that anyone who can concentrate for more than 3 minutes these days is akin to a zen master but rush have never been a band to follow mainstream thinking the result is this simply excellent album and for that we can be appreciative|1
this album was a pleasant surprise  i liked it much better than the last one  myles kennedy is a great singer  there isnt a single song i dont like|1
warning dont watch this after the original thorn birds as you will be bitterly disappointed it should never have been made as a it doesnt fit in with the original so many inconsistencies i was shouting at the screen ralph did not see maggie for 19 years after matlock island and he never ever met her kids in that time  and she certainly never went back to luke as she so brilliantly tells ralph when dane dies in the original it changes the whole story b only the stunning richard chamberlain is left from first cast the new meggie cannot hold a candle to rachel ward where the chemistry was incredible julia blake as fee is dreadful and totally miscast nothing like jean simmons character and where oh where was bryan brown as for vittorio played by the wonderful christopher plummer in the first series he was pitifully bad did the producers not watch the original   and the set is terrible too reminiscent of dallas just awful no wonder the old cast didnt want to get involved richard is as ever electric on screen and the only good thing about the film colleen m reportedly hated the first series god knows what she must have made of this one eek i will bin this and stick with the original which was fab|0
i have wanted a carpenters christmas album for 3 years now and finally got it for christmas this year as a gift  it was a gigantic dissapointment  i did not want all the other music in there with it i just wanted the carpenters  i did not review the cd on line to see what it involved but someone else bought it for me  anyway huge dissapointment  great songs but like i said i just wanted the carpenters|0
this book is one of those that you just cant put down it is so well written and the story is so interesting you will want to keep reading to see where the story goes the story is fascinating and just when you think you get where the story is going it gives you a shift that turn out to be not only a great read but thought provoking as well i would love to see this turned into a movie if you like to read then this is a book for you one of the best books ive ever read i dont want to say much because i wouldnt want to ruin the surprises that are in store great page turner|1
the wall is actually a pretty good song with its driving bass and distorted guitar  nevertheless true to form they ruin it at the end with the screeching voice saying you wont get any pudding  why did these guys find it so hard to just be normal|0
wonderful odes to hot chocolate soup new boots and groundhogs day  my kids husband and i all adore tommy dont lick that pipe  and where else can one find a tango about the flu  to my knowledge john mccutcheon has composed the only flu song ever  wintersongs will definitely warm up your dreary winter  but its also a cool listen in the heat of summer|1
being pretty much forced to surrender my gift certificate to this rather than mellon collie i was almost put off the beatles right off the bat i didnt like this cd aside from free as a bird and some of the later tracks nearing their creative golden age i just didnt like the songs maybe im picking bones but at the time i wasnt a hardcoreenough fan to go gaga over 15 second snippets of interviews with john lennon and some badsounding demos historic significance didnt really mean much to me back then and it still doesnt today perhaps one day i will give this album a thorough listen to see if i like it but the last time i listened to it it still didnt click with me stick with the next two anthologies especially number 2 two discs of embryonic genius|0
i really didnt like the cd i thought i was buying music by a group called blue montreaux which has a few outstanding cuts this cd i purchased was below my expectatiins in addition it was really expensive thus i probably wont purchase anymore cds from amazon|0
the wall was and is still one of the best pink floyd cds but it is not  the best for that reason i have chosen to give it 4 stars the wall is all  about how roger waters complaning that he was now famous and he didnt want  to be famous there are good songs on this cd another brick in the wall  in the fleshhey you disc 1 is the best disk i would recomend meddle  dsotm wish you were here andor piper at the gates of dawn if you are a  true fan like me though i would buy the wall for songs that i hadnt heard  yet even though some are not worth listening to the wall is important  because it is the last great roger waters cd if you do buy the wall try to  find the meaning it is harder than any other pink floyd cd|1
singing railsrailroad songs  this was for my husband who loves music and during college worked for the railroad and he really enjoyed this music|1
get this if you want the musical score and not the music soundtrack i ended up giving this to my son|0
you want something you can play over and over againthis is the album for youi love the songs they dojst pure rock and roll at its bestif you like hard rock then you will enjoy this|1
never did totally hate it but it definitely felt like a calculated attempt at cashing in on the bands name  whats more it has that clean majorlabel 80s production that muzakked many a songanyway if you want to own the repuation and not the musicianship this is the record for you|0
if youre looking for the percussive music genre tektekan then youre better off withthe music of bali vol 3 kecak  tektekanthis is a recording of a dance drama what you mostly hear is voices that declaim the dialog there is also some simple percussion with a small ensemble of bamboo slap sticks which play a just one simple sounding rhythm main musical interest is at the points where the rhythm ends slightly chaotically which reveals that simple pulse is actually made up of a typical balinese type interlocking rhythmsound quality is good just a stereo mic pointed at the performance what makes this cd less inpressive is that its not a recording of a musical performance|0
i want danny elfman back  neither of goldenthals batman scores can compare with the original batman although batman and robin compares favorably with batman returns  for a better buy grab a hold of the bootlegpromo of batman and robin  this cd is just too bizarre  it is a totally incoherent listen  buy batman danny elfman  you will definitely be satisfied with that|0
i bought this tape for a friend of mine  they played it once and it unravelled and couldnt be used again|0
this cpo disc long out of print but still available here and there collects two pieces by wolfgang rihm manfred reichert leads the ensemble 13kein firmament for 14 players 1988 is an ambitious work that clocks in at 37 minutes the piece essentially consists of individual tones separate by long and i mean long silences it is quite similar to what the late music of luigi nono and the use of unorthodox instrumental techniques here and there are reminiscent of lachenmann i confess to finding it extremely difficult to get through kein firmament as it is so derivative of those other two composers that rihms distinctive voice is lost entirely sine nomine for brass quintet 1985 is more engaging a nineminute exposition of the concentrated expressionism that is rihm at his best its an unstable soundscape where each instrument struggles to articulate over its peersall in all i could only recommend this disc to rihm completists i generally prefer rihms works from before 1988 and after 1992 and i find the nono period to be a low point in the composers output|0
i will leave a lengthier review to some other ardent rush fans though i have loved them since their start this cd really grows on me and i have listened to it at least 50 times or more the production and mix is far superior to any of their releases imo since the mid 1980s i am a huge fan of the classic rush sound and a farewell to kings is my favorite rush recording but i have to say i would have to put clockwork angels next in in line followed by 2112 that should say it all|1
due ragazzi nel sole is one of my alltime favorite love songs and the version included here is not the original version that hit the charts in 1976 but yet another version recorded by the band with different arrangement melodies and harmonies in various parts i dont know well the other tracks included in the cds so i cant tell if theyre original versions or rerecorded versions too moreover the cd was mastered with the audio at extremely high levels and the songs sound annoyingly loudyou can find the original version of due ragazzi nel sole in the ciao ciao bambina compilation collage and their fans deserved better|0
me encanta me encanta me encanta los mejores sones veracruzanos los vas a encontrar en este cd|1
this is quiet harmonious music but its basically the same few notes repeated throughout  it was a waste of money for me|0
i purchased this cd for one song the extremely romantic update of moonlight by sting  the song is terribly muffled the sound quality is awful i transfered the song onto my ipod  it is impossible to mix it with the other songs  when moonlight plays it necessitates that i turn it up to hear stings words and then the next song comes on too loud  argh  and what is even more annoying is that the other songs on the cd are fine|0
this album was a great disappointment  there is this strange scratchyhiss noise that occurs randomly through out the recording  it completely detracts from the music  also it sounded like it was recorded in some highschool gym  the acoustics were awful|0
slash is at the top of his game here and on a whole other level these days this is a great release this has been a great month for artist releases and this is surely one of them some ripping guitar work glad to see he has found a band lineup to gel with alot of people are kind of slamming on myles kennedy here i think he does a great job and is able to pull off some of slashs previous work with gr and velvet revolver not too many guys out there to do this he fits the mold as with most singers for me i get tired of hearing them over time and prefer one who can chage up there game example of a great vocalist that i can only take so much of is glenn hughes great voice but after a few songs i am over it i dont get tired of listening to myles on here the song not for me is my favorite and sure to become a hit happy for slash and would definatlly make a point to see them in concert slashs new band is more gr than gr is|1
easily the most disappointing cd i have purchased in years  hard to differentiate one track from the next  they all sound as though they are based on the same bit of drum programming and anything with the word programming in it is not really music  i played each track once then deleted it from my system|0
fans of pink floyd are mixed regarding the final cut the last pink floyd album to include the intact band before splitting up following up on the heels of the wall the final cut is roger waters dirge to his departed father fletcher who was killed in world war ii the final cut is an angry sobbing tribute with waters pathos ringing and clanging throughout despite this shameless display the final cut is a superbly executed album the music is very well recorded and the mastering is among pink floyds best the performances are truly good with excellent musicianship by all members of the band the final cut is a decidedly 80s album however many of the topics including the war in the falkland islands and the threat of nuclear war are themes that may not resonate with younger listenersin short the final cut is a wellmade album technically but is flawed by rogers histrionics as a pink floyd fan i purchased it and gave it much attention yet as that same fan i had quite enough of it soon enough for me this album was not merely the final cut it was the last straw|0
what a stupid album the people of made it where high at the time|0
legendary american hardcore fast noisy but tight cd has the long out of print 7 ep plus some compilation tracks highly recommended if you love fast intense hardcore similar in some respects to neos and mob 47|1
as a rush die hard i own every album in their catalog however i will concede not all albums are excellence in action in fact there are some real stinkers that have come along in the last 35 years clockwork angels however is not one of them if you are a rush fan youll probably like this though it has nothing to do with 2112 except for the time on the album cover is 912 or 2112 by 24 hour standards this album is of that quality if you are not a rush fan you might still like this album or at least some of the songs thank you rush for keeping it real|1
so reducing this to songs i can still listen to years later1 something2 i want you shes so heavy3 you never give me your money4 she came in through the bathroom window5 golden slumbers6 the endthe other stuff hcts by harrison possible exception just isnt great song writing blind beatle sheep stop spamming the world with talk of how great and legendary they are just when the old wave of beatle sheep former one right here come to their senses a younger generation get turned on to them courtesy of hype and stick on for years till they too hopefully regain their senses this only applies to a few of them the majority are hooked on this substandard crap for life more cash for olivia dhani yoko paul and ringo you digusting money grabbing scam artists|0
thank you anywhere else i would have had to pay 30 dollars  but not now only a minor scratch but didnt affect the playback so thank you|1
this will probably be the highwater mark in michael w smiths career because this is truly a magical christmas album  the music the lyrics even smiths modest vocals all work to make this one of my alltime favorite christmas cds  standouts from the album include christ the messiah no eye had seen and the simple yet incredibly beautiful all is well  that last piece is worth the price of the cd  smith who in my opinion is a better musician than a vocalist really has created his masterwork here  the production is lush and the tone is absolutely perfect  a modern christmas classic that you will never tire of|1
i just got this cd today and i havent turned it off yet  every song is great  i love the sound of her voice  i really like all of the acoustic cuts on the album highly recommend didnt even realize this was a christian album but that is a plus|1
this records is so bad there are no words to describe it on a scale of 1 to 5 stars i rate it 100 its so obvious that this record was made for the money theres nothing in it to show just a slight intention for artyou have money to wastefor christs shake dont throw them bying this crap burn them make a donation throw em in the street but dont waste em on this dump it straight to the garbage can|0
i do not consider myself a slash fan but i do like some of his older music from guns n roses velvet revolver and now his own album with myles kennedy  great album great songs great music enough said|1
simply put this recording bears all the characteristics of a bad 60s baroque recording slow tempi cuts in the score random rearrangements etc despite the fine cast lead by beverly sills and norman triegle they are all horribly let down by the very person who inspired this productionjulius rudels tempi are often excruciatingly slow the recitative the thin thread that connects all the show pieces into a coherent whole is taken so slowly that you wonder if the characters are speaking in bed even the most expresive moments are dumbed down by this approach also check out caesars hit va tacito e nascosto near the end of act 1 and the sextuscornelia duet already a very slow piece is nearly twice as long as compared to other recordingswhile cutting out certain arias and recits may be neccesary due to physical constraints i do not see the logic in rearranging the arias cleopatras act 3 hit aria piangero is here shifted to act 2 where she pretends to be lydia in order to seduce caesar to her side in doing so the aria changes its meaning and has taken on a devious less serious context which im sure was not what handel and librettist nichola hyam intendedand while beverly wolff did a great job with sextus i personally feel that casting a soprano here seems untidy as the other 2 trouser roles are sung by baritonesthis set of course is from the famous production that launched beverly sills to fame therefore by advice is to only get this if you are a big fan of the singers my personal favourite is the mackerras set with janet baker as caesar recorded in english if you must have a baritone version get the one with walter barry as caesar by label opera doro it may be in german but the overall performance is much superior plus it is a complete recording spread over 3 cds at budget price this is probably the only fulllength recording you can find|0

my first introduction to rush was in 1985 when i was 14 i was captivated by their early releases but must say they have evolved unlike any band out there they have not tried to do the same thing and expect the same instead they have stayed current while maintaining their unique sound and on top of that they are only three guys as old as my dad but as young as any twenty something wannabee rocker out therethis album is fantastic as i have had at least 5 full listens every time i am in awe of the grooves the lyrics and especially the bass chops and neils power and finesse on the kit alex adds beefy hooks and layers texture to compliment the fullness of this triolyrically i am still exploring this album and cant wait for the book that comes out in septemberso for 27 years they continue to prove to me that they are the kings of prog rock but really are they progno they are the might rushfive stars hands down|1
now the name chickenfoot sounds kinda funky for a rock band but let me say this album is better than the album before this album is deeper and it has some great jams on here for everyonei cannot stop listening to this album and let me say if you want good music for your ears go out and buy this|1
unfortunately i read the other reviews posted here and bought this recording based on the glowing sentiments expressed  hmph  if this is what people think a great recording is then musicality has certainly taken an alarming turn for the worse  a few people did mention that the voices might not be the best but seem to think that this is a small matter  guess what  the two lead singers are pretty darn bad and to me its a big deal  they are marginal singers at best i can only assume that acting and dancing are valued more than truly beautiful voices anymore and that the music is taking a back seat to more visual concerns  it was actually quite literally painful for me to listen to the tracks sung by riding and hayden  every time that we want a musical delivery were cheated of the payoff  rodgers and hammerstein created works of genius that are pure musical wonder and this particular work deserves passion feeling and true musical prowess from the performers  this recording sorely lacks these qualities  the only redeeming qualities  the singing of clive rowe as enoch snow and nice conducting in the prologue  otherwise save your money and  no dont save your money  buy another recording like the old one with shirley jones and gordon macrae and listen to some good voices  really  trust me  i have a fine set of musical ears and i know voices|0
1st it says that it was cds not cassettesi was not please by this i asked you how can i return these cassettes to u since i no longer use cassettes player and you never respondedi still have the cassette just like u sent them worthless|0
while im perhaps a little late to the party im glad to see so many reviewers love this great cdand it deserves all the accolades its received for sure  slash myles kennedy and the band have made some really great music here  it works on every level and its just well done in every way  it hits on all cylinderswellwritten songs tremendous musicianship slash is at his inspired best but this is truly a group effort and a ton of energy and real passion  who said theres no great music being made these daysthis is a strong cd across the board but a few very favorite songs include standing in the sun no more heroes halo we will roam and not for me  but from beginning to end this is a very strong effort  i have no doubt ill be listening to this one for a long time to come|1
i will never get tired of rush congrats for being nominated for the rock  roll hall of fame finally|1
the use of period instruments produces some interesting sonorities but norringtons approach shows that he continually ignores the emotional aspect of musicmaking i get the impression that im listening to an elaborate machine a kind of synthesizer anyone remember those experiments from the 1970s feed in the score and get a perfect reproduction of the musicnorrington concentrates so hard on reproducing whats on paper that he doesnt communicate you get output not a symphony there are very pretty individual sounds but it doesnt come together into anything that makes me sit up and take notice|0
id have a lot more respect though no more love for this album if it was released as a david gilmour solo album which it is in all but name but having recently listened to this album again its aged even worse than i remember  it is on par with gilmours second solo album which is to say it has brief moments of beauty but is mostly forgettable  this album is as much a pop album as about face was but at least that didnt masquerade as a  pink floyd album  i find all of floyds albums from meddle onward to still be relevant today but this is dispensable  check out on an island if you want to hear gilmours talents or division bell which is far better than this|0
i got this along with bregovics silence of the balkans and czas cyganow  all three of them are uninteresting and uninspiring to me much less energizing as some reviewers mentioned  i was so influenced by reviewer enthusiasm i unwisely bought all three simultaneously  big mistake  no more bregovic for me how anyone can get much balkans out of his music is baffling to me|0
before i knew pink floyd i knew who they were people always talked about getting stoned and listening to dark side of the moon ridiculous because pink floyd is like the cure you have to pay attention the wall is one of  those recordings that far surpasses most like sgt peppers the wall will  always have a market sure dark side of the moon is arguably the best pink  floyd but i choose the wall because its message is haunting this album  is like peering inside roger waterss psyche it is roger waterss psyche  after the wall pink floyd sounds spent the wall is a great two disc sonic  story masterpiece who else besides the who could pull of such a feat even  nine inch nailss new double cd a meditation on anger the fragile cant  stand up to the wall this is a must have for any music fan|1
james horner i consider is one of the worsts composers evereverything in this soundtrack  that i proudly dont own  is poor i must admit that i like the braveheart soundtracki think if john williams or gabriel yared made this soundtrack will be very great to mention the mainstream big and good names i avoid see titanic and i do like the movie because of this horrible soundtrack full of clicheacutes the worst obviously is celine dion singing my heart will go on and surprise they get the oscars troy is the last example of how bad james horner is thankfully the academy redeem herself in giving the lord of the rings the deserved oscars for best original score in my sense there are only two big champions of the oscars benhur and the return of the king howard shore working with best directors like david cronenberg jonathan demme martin scorsese peter jackson is a more talented and vanguard than the most of american movie composers please directors dont give james horner soundtracks for him to do|0
i bought this cd because i was going to be teaching a preschool ballet class there were very few usable songs on the disc they sounded too well classical  not kid enough for me maybe i just had the wrong idea when i bought it i dont know|0
i agree with the last reviewer this sounds like it was recorded on a mr microphone get echoes of natures bayou instead|0
this was one of the worst shows ever to hit broadway  the songs are so bad that they were eliminated entirely from the movie version even though the movie was obviously intended to be a musical and starred frank sinatra and maurice chevalier as the son and the father respectively  i played in the pit for a production of this thing and by the end by the end of the run could barely tolerate going to the theatre each evening  the best ballad i like you is sung by the son to his father  welcome home sounds promising but isnt addressed to anyone  it continues welcome home says the chair as i enter in the roomthis is a recording from the 50s and doesnt compare to modern production valuesid pass|0
raffi is so great for kids this has all the songs my kids loved and now i have them for my grand kids|1

this guy is brilliant  ive seen him live a handful of times and he never fails me  hes one of the few clean comics left out there  he proves that you can be funny and entertaining without swearing or resorting to potty humor  i buy this cd for friends who need a laugh|1
ive long been a huge michel legrand fan going back to 1964 when i fell in love with his music for the umbrellas of cherbourg  later there would be the young girls of rochfort along with instrumental soundtracks for brians song lady sings the blues and many others with yentl one of his crowning achievements  i immediately ordered this when i saw that it was available but it has no business being released on cd  none whatsoever  the music is dull and lifeless and much of it quite unpleasant  what a disappointment  at the fsmfilm score monthly site where i learned about this cd i posted the followingi just received this cd and out of nearly 41 minutes of music really cant find a single cue that i even want to download with me rating most of them as 1 star out of 5 it feels like michel legrand wrote this music while he was either asleep or playing solitaire  or maybe sitting on the toilet for example trio jazz which ends the cd is an endless somnambulistic exercise in utter boredom  and it goes on for almost 5 12 agonizing minutes and the more than 5 minute road map for a free jazz group is just headacheinducing noise not one of the 9 legrand cues gets more than 2 out of 5 stars from me so its not even worth downloading so i didnt theres an aria from elizabeth harwood casta diva from bellinis opera norma the song atlantic city my old friend from robert goulet and song of india from the big band era leaving us with only about 28 minutes of forgettable legrand treacle advice to legrand fans while the cd has a pretty cover save save save your money on this ridiculous waste of postage what i found pretty much matches what another writer wrote that its only about 28 minutes of original music by legrand but its some of the worst legrand i have ever heardagain ive long adored michel legrand and his wonderful music which was why i bought this sight unseen so to speak  so try to preview this before you buy it  who knows  you might even like it|0
i was disappointed to see that this cd was a voiceover performance of the magic flute i only wanted the music not the story linei had to use you tube in my teachingthis cd would be good for families when they are driving in the car  to listen to the story and music|0
this cd is very easy to listen and get into i have listened to it when i feel stressed tinas voice is very soothing and it transmits peace and a sense of wellbeing we get so caught up with the demands of life that we forget to take care of our number 1 asset we have our health tinas message sends you back to this place of balance and belief that everything will be ok no need to worry and overeact great tool to quiet the mind|1
i wont rehash others posts here  just a few personal opinions though best rush release in 30 years moving pictures definitely in their top 5 studio albums in a quality class with moving pictures permanent waves 2112  whatever your other personal favorite might be best individual song composition since subdivisions track 4 the anarchista must listen  the album only gets better on subsequent listens as more of its musical depth surfaces  after i listened to this album the 3rd time through it just seemed to click in my head and i have been floored since|1
this was a terrible cdi couldnt stand ittestify to love and forgive  forget are  the only halfdecent songs on the whole album dont buy this cdits terrible|0
no need for me to write a full review of this album it is a masterpiece and my absolute favorite album of all time it never gets old if you dont own it you cant call yourself a fan of rock music period greatest album ever made|1
i just gave ca a first listen and i must say im very impressed  although theres a lot to digest theres a lot to immediately like on this album  im already feeling like there are songs on here that are destined to be classics  its nice to hear caravan and bu2b in their proper context and i like them much more now then i did at first especially bu2b  that one always had a hot and cold temperment with me and the newly recorded intro and subtle tweaks to the mix make it a solid songboth die hard rush fans and casual fans alike should appreciate this album  there are snipets of their past sound middle career sound and current sound in there but also a look toward the future  in essence its rush succeeding in being rush by releasing something new and differentok  now that the warm and fuzzy stuff is over here is what i am very disappointed in with this recording  the mix  once again we have a muddy clipped production  not unlistenable like vapor trails was but simply annoying  in the 40 minutes during my drive to work today i got out of the car and my ears were ringing from the noise  this isnt the loud kind either  there simply is no breathing room if i can borrow another reviewers comment between instruments  neils drums sound like hes banging on quaker oatmeal cans  alex and geds guitars are sometimes completely lost in the songs and several parts come across as just a wall of distortion  before you all jump on me about not being a true fan or accusing me of not listening to it on a quality sound system or whatnot consider the rest of your music collection and how that sounds compare to more modern production  theres no comparision at all i made a comment in another reviewers thread that 95 of my collection dating back to the early 80s sounds fantastic on everything i plug it into  the remaining 5 most of which was released in the past 15 years or so is just like this  wth i just dont get it  the only thing i can come up with is that theyre now mixing it for the ipod folks who are used to inarticulate  sound because theyre just going to rip it into low quality low bit files i dunnoanyway cheers to the boys for releasing such a great collection of songs i hope they keep rocking forever  jeers to this day and age of sound mixing and poor quality production  cant wait to see em in buffaloupdate  yep  i just ripped it to my blackberry and im listening to it with my earbuds  it sounds fine with little to no complaining from me at this point if this is the format i want to listen which it isnt  trouble is whether car stereo home stereo bose wave still sounds like mud  grrrupdate 2  after about five listens straight through i have to say that this is a fantastic album  every song has great hooks and there is a lot going on in there as usual  the garden is simply an amazing experience and hearing the prereleases in their proper context adds to them even more  i have to say that this will be up there in my favorite rush album category  not a single t urd on this release  great job rush|1
these guys whether anyone likes or dislikes them or their music are having fun no matter what type of review is posted  rock on i say  before this band was formed theyd already made their mark on the music world made their millions too and will continue to do so whether chickenfoot iii sells 500000 copies or not  anybody who doesnt like hard rock or any member of the band or a downonyour knees vh worshipper dont buy it  its as plain and simple as that  me i think its great and i cant wait to see them live again  ill certainly play this new release often and loud  already on my ipodps i am a van halen fan also and no matter what the quality of their next release is i will add it to my music collection|1
concept albums can be hit or miss but were in good hands with rush clockwork angels is a masterpiece from start to finish|1

the pope was not on this disc someone else was reading his speach after he gave it my motherinlaw was very disappointed|0
these versions are mostly awfulreallyby the way this review is for sound choice spotlight series 8379ive been a karaoke junkie since 1996 and host since 2005 and beatles fan all my life i have sang to many beatles karaoke tracks and these are honestly some of the worst the instrumentals are quite good and had sound choice left well enough alone there this would be a decent cdg sadly excessive backing vocals are added and not only do they sound nothing like the beatles they are all sung with a hideous lisp i can only speculate that this was done to make them sound british but it fails miserablyif youre looking for beatles karaoke anthologies i highly recommend the ones by top tunesall star karaoke ask1544and amerisingin my karaoke system im only using 4 songs off this disc because i have better versions of all the others the only one thats worthwhile is roll over beethoven which while actually quite good doesnt justify the cost of this cdg|0

brian regan is my favorite comedian  he is so funny  i prefer this cd over his i walked on the moon  both are very entertaining but the material on live is hysterical  i love that he doesnt feel the need to use crude or foul humor hes a treat|1
i thought it was going to be a lot better  i grew up listening to banda and it was disappointing to not hear some of the better songs from that era  i liked about 5 songs on all 3 cds  not a good buy|0
rushs clockwork angels album makes me sad im sad that no radio stations will play any music from this masterpiece thus making sure that very few people will hear one of the greatest pieces of musical artistry ever im sad that only true rush fans will hear the astounding work on this incredible album this is the best album by any musician or band in ten years this is as good as any album ever the thought and work that went into making this masterpiece are apparent throughout this is the followup to the incredible vapor trails that i wanted snakes and arrows to be this album is beautiful bombast im blown away at how good it really is the more i listen the more i appreciate what was accomplished here i wont review each track as it has already been done here ad nauseum suffice to say i wish everyone could experience this work of art the musicianship is incredible as always but the songs are all intense hardrocking songs filled with technical soul and the whole thing revolves around a fantastic story that entertains and makes you think this album is a true joy i just wish more could enjoy it|1
this audio cd it seems was used the box dirty broken and the cd itself with scratches totally disappointed i dont recommended|0

i bought this cd because it got a 5 star rating and i was so disappointed  i realize it was recorded in 1997 but the jokes are totally obsolete and i didnt even crack a smile during the entire cd  not funny at all|0
simply undiscribable ya its that good bummer they only go up 5 stars|1
this book is well worth the price for just the flyers alone it is thick and large and in full exploding rock and roll color many good los angeles bands are featured janes addiction and a few that never broke big but are still around rebel rebel and that is what makes this book the bomb a box set cd and dvd companion will be out in 2005 featuring all the bands in the book this book lets everyone in on the lifestyle that was the sunset strip during that time the 80s to 1990 im sorry i hadnt thought of the idea first|1
this cd was used more often for circle time than any other  wonderful language development tool as well as counting and rhyming  we made props to go with many of the songs and made them interactive with hand gestures the songs are catchy for even adults and leaves everyone in a good mood warning some songs are known to drive adults insane as they repeat in your head long after the cd is off  ive seen it used with great results with developmentally challenged children as well as regular education class rooms the kids and teachers love it|1
this set includes three of raffis most popular records and is a great way  to build a collection  these songs never seem to wear thin or become  annoying like many other arrangements do  in fact i know the recordings  so well that i often catch myself singing the next song before it startsthe song selection is quite diverse  some of the songs have a positive  message like about brushing your teeth or sharing with others  other  songs celebrate the joyful experience of being a child like shake my  sillies out i wonder if im growing or bumping  up and down  then there are ones that are just plain fun like  willoughby wallaby woo or oh me oh my but raffi  also includes some classic folk songs like swing low sweet  chariot ive been working on the railroad and  goodnight irene  there are very few duds on this  collection most are the type of song that will just pop into your head  someday and for no reason at all you will find yourself humming itmy  daughter loves these cds and always breaks out in a wide smile after  hearing the first few chords  partially i think she smiles because they  always put me in a good mood too  hey you cant beat that|1
i am an avid pink floyd fan but i have to say this is by far pink floyds worst album  the most obvious reason this album is so weak compared to floyds other albums is that roger waters is not in the band anymore and the lyrics and music really suffer as a result  strangely enough richard wright is not an official member of the band though he makes an appearance as one of many session musicians  of course there has been plenty of controversy over the legal battles between waters and gilmour but david gilmour deserves plenty of criticism for releasing this album under the pink floyd name especially when one takes into account the minimal contributions of richard wright and nick mason to this album much of the drumming and percussion is actually electronic and session drummers are playing most of the real drums  nick mason apparently felt out of practice so he wasnt up for playing much drums on this album  rather than richard wright jon carin plays a lot of the keyboards as well as bob ezrin and gilmour himself  the bass is played mostly by tony levin of king crimson fame all kinds of other session musicians are featured on this album as well  gilmour also had plenty of help from other songwriters outside pink floyd in writing this album  for me its pretty easy to see and hear  this isnt really pink floyd folksanyway the best song on this disappointing album is on the turning away this is a memorable song and gilmour does a very nice job on this one  learning to fly is also quite entertaining and enjoyable to listen to  sorrow is adequate the guitar intro is tasteful but the lyrics are not up to par especially in the context of pink floyds larger body of work  aside from a few nice guitar licks here and there the rest of the album is boring and lacks both direction and imagination  i have always thought that this should have been a david gilmour solo album and its pretty obvious that gilmour was just cashing in by using the pink floyd name  this album always leaves me feeling unsatisfied and expink floyd leader roger waters had every right to be unhappy about its release|0
a self cleansing project filled with oryemas life story includes the haunting tracks like makambo which talks of his exile from his native uganda and solitude a song of comfort to his widowed mother makambo and solitude are featured in the pure moods collection and also in zalman kings movie red shoe diaries|1
when this album was released in the early eighties most people didnt know what to think the final cut very well could be the album comprised of just tracks cut from the wall since the subject matter seems very very similar if you view the film youll notice that when the tigers broke free was included and throughout the war is mentionedso most likely if you are a fan of pink floyds the wall this album is worth a listenmy review is only my opinion please make sure that you know that my views on this album are not the alpha and omega there are qualities to this album that can very much warrant the words this album getsnow that i am done with my disclaimer please notice the following i can classify the final cut with the following wordswhinypatheticdullslowrepetativepersonally i am not able to connect to mr waters songwriting i know all and well about rogers obvious commandeering of the band by the point of production for this album but i do not think that this gave good results the absense of the band members input and the silent and hidden tallent and unique creativity of rick wright the original pink floyd keyboard player gives roger waters far too much power his results were the final cut and it does not sound like any other pink floyd album out there the very unfortunate part about this result was that roger waters was digging the slow and moody songs by this point in his life lets just say that he really over did thisthe i heard the opening track i just couldnt listen anymore what fueled my revisting of this album was my recent viewing of a pink floyd tribute band performance they mentioned how their favorite album was the final cut  and i was just so surprised i had to hear it again to see what it was really so well received fori still cannot find what is found in this record the songs are slow boring repetetive and very cliched at times with roger waters voice being an even more focusedon than before one should have expected vocals that added to the song however i found that it took away greatly from some great background music the whole monologue idea that roger waters performed did not work here in my opinion and i would have much rather favored hearing the real instrumentalists of pink floyd the other two remaining members both very virtuous musicians perform without the vocalspink floyd was not a very vocal band their amazing musicianship contributed to a lot of their success their innovation was not in lyrics as much as it was in creativity and experimentation this album just leaves a pain in my ears when i hear it now i hear the lyrics and i really think that they are poorlywritten the voice is purposely sad and also leads to a really pathetic and the same old same old kind of soundi suppose i should recommend this album a listen to most pink floyd fans considering the other fans who here who have written reviews on the genius of this album far outnumber people with my opinions there must be something to be seen on this album unfortunately i am unable to see the good qualities of this record but considering this is the opinion coming from a diehard floyd fan and one whos favorite pink floyd member is actually david gilmore instead of the usual roger waters my opinion may be quite unpopular if your favorite pink floyd albums consist of ummagumma and atom heart mother then this may be an album to consider skipping  unless you want a completely different experiencei think that some artists were able to completely change around their music styles with success eric clapton and frank zappa for example were both able to essentially visit the odds and ends of many different genres they did this quite well however pink floyd was not able to accomplish this correctly in my view immediately after the wall i knew that my pink floyd was gone forever and indeed it was  this album proved it to mehowever the average pink floyd fan looking for more might love this album i do not know i suggest that if you are reading this review now that you should still give this album a listen it obviously has something in it worth buying and hearing but from one pink floyd fan to anotherbe warned|0
wont be disappointed ha before buying this set i was familiar with about half of the sonatas so i was obviously interested in hearing more i bought this set because i happened to be on a tight budget when buying a  budget cd you realistically cant expect the best performance or even the  best recorded sound however you should be able to expect a decent  performance and decent recorded sound and i always try to look for a  review just to make sure its not terrible well amazons review led me  astray with this set of cds i may have been able to overlook the  lackluster performance if it wasnt for the fact that the sound is simply  horrible the reverb is just unacceptable it seems it was recorded in a  hall with less than ideal acousticsi couldnt recommend this set  at any price considering the other options out there if youre looking  for bargain beethoven jandos cycle on naxos is where to start both the  performance and sound are excellentavoid this set|0
a masterpiece in every sense of the word  pink floyds epic sprawling tome on loneliness and isolation should be in every serious rock collectors shelf  there isnt any album out there that sounds anything like this and probably never will  it also contains the greatest pink floyd song of all time comfortably numb  forget eminem britney spears christina aguilera or whoever the flavor of the month is this is rock and roll|1
i bought this wanting to hear charlie watts play jazz it is really a soft warm and tender crooner type of album featuring the vocalist its probably ok if thats what you like but its not my cup of tea|0
ill preface by saying that its easy to dismiss fanboys reviews as having a halo effect pun intended before they even start  rest assured that this is not the case  i have enjoyed rush songs over the years heck i even learned bastille day in my fledgling days of trying to forge my own high school garage band but was taken by surprise to find the threesome was still even in existence when i heard the wreckers on internet radio recently  what happened next has been nothing short of extraordinarysince i subscribe to an online source that provides unlimited access to music i decided to taste the clockwork angels lineup  i have to be honest that my first time through probably looked like the reverend jim sampling his first funny brownies in taxi really showing my age here i sampled rolled my eyes and uttered a less than impressed meh  i said fine i did it now lets move on  but i picked up the remnants and couldnt let go  like reverend jim it didnt take long until i was addictedafter a few times through and finding i couldnt stop liking it i read the reviews here  both good and bad  i saw where the slams about the muddy sound came from although in my digital version it probably came across a little cleaner than the cd  so i started going back through the anthology and sampled the comparative products in vapor trails test for echo and snakes and arrows  it was a great rediscovery of rush over the years but the more i listened the more i realized that clockwork angels was something specialevery piece of art affects a person in a different way and so it is with music  i will say this however many times i have heard people refer in their past how an album changed their lives  i scoffed in the past secretly thinking cmon dude  its just an album  that was before clockwork angels  this for me has become my sergeant peppers lonely hearts club band  to think that these guys made this after nearly 40 years together at nearly the age of 60 is nothing short of unfathomableso to make this a review lets hit the high points and try to avoid the redundant1 yes its a concept album tying together a story  when you know the story its even better but i love the suggestion that you listen several times to get the feel of the music before you learn about the story  i never had heard the term steampunk before this album but it has suddenly awakened an itch in the genre i never knew i had2 the writing of neil peart is absolutely brilliant as always  the fact that the man can create this yarn out of nothing and have his two bandmates weave a musical sound to match the words is beyond words3 lee and lifeson have never been more vibrant at their craft than they are now  i could do as many before me have done and recount each song ad nauseum as to their brilliance but suffice it to say each song sounds so much better every time through4 the musicianship of the threesome is nothing short of brilliant  perhaps its having first heard the song the wreckers immediately after listening to green day attempt to replace musicianship with shock in their lame kill the dj that i grew an instant appreciation for what clockwork angels representsmost important the album sends the listener through an amazing rollercoaster of sounds  the hard charging caravanbu2b combo lead into the orchestral title song followed by a pair of wellcrafted songs  the monster ballad halo effect is as haunting as it is beautiful and every man who has fallen for the wrong woman will identify with the words sentiment and feel of the song  from there the boys alternate between heavy duty rockblues and a softer side until the truly novel wish them well which occupies a spot on its own  this spicy little number offers a little 70s throwback with some contemporary twists  at no point on the album does the group sound more threeman in the offing never have they sounded betterthe finale the garden deserves a category unto itself  it is peaceful it is beautiful it is brilliant and it is the seminal piece of songwriting from an amazing career from the three  every time i listen to it a different powerful image is evoked  it would be easy to identify this as the bands equivalent to led zeppelins rain song but this surpasses even that masterpiece  peart clearly hammered away at the concept of time and the impact of life and lee and lifeson boiled this into a masterful sound worthy of the sense of reflection that peart intended  i defy any listener to pay careful attention to every aspect of this song and reflecting on the numerous number young lives lost recently in connecticut not be moved to tears at how they lost the fullness of time the only return that they should expect  yes time is indeed still the infinite jestokay this is long  ive never written a review before but nothing has moved me this much before  this is an album something of an anomaly in the 10s  all of the songs together weave a beautiful tale and it amazes me that a trio of guys of canada two of whom came together as buddies in school could create something this majestic this much later  john lennon once said its not so amazing that the beatles broke up after 10 years but the stones lasted  what would he think to hear a group who had been together nearly four times that long putting out something this meaningful|1
while technically stunning in concept and execution the music is surprisingly empty  none of it reached me  surprising as thats a rare occurance for rush  there just isnt anything that remained in my mind or soul after a couple listens  disappointing|0
he walked a mile is just 1 of my many favorite cds that i ownthat 1 song changed my life totaly|1
enigmatic idiosyncratic possibly mentally ill and extremely talented is the legacy that seems to follow junior junior byles after listening to curly locks id have to add another adjective underapperiated to the mix curly locks the best of junior byles is an sincere attempt to capture the career of this talented and troubled  reggae star it succeeds with flying colors mostly because of the talent of byles and the genius of lee perry first of all the talent songwritng and singing of junior byles is at times astounding his voice sounds so sweet and touching without being sappy especially on fever a place called africa and fun and games his falsetto voice exudes sincerity and humility his songwriting is strong if you listen to the words on uplifting a place called africa the political when will better come beat down babylon and  the humurous got the tip shows the range in songs byles was capable of  one cannot forget the production whic was handled by the imortal lee perry his riddims mesh perfectly with byles voice its easy to see why the two of them worked so well together  this compatibility is never more evident than on the title track curly locks there are three different version of it yes three the first is the immortal original which is folloed by a vey different virtually accapella version and rounded out by a drum and bass version of the song these are a colectors dreamone of my favorite reggae albums that i own  its too bad more people arent aware of this unapperciard star of reggae music|1
this cd truly tells a storysomtimes haunting sometimes oppressive but a real story  it is less assaultive than the movie seems to make it out to be  it is a classic among classics|1
if you are a metal fan and like slash you will love this cd  it is absolutley vintage slash  he and myles kennedy are a metalmarriage made in heaventhere simply is not a bad song on thid cd you can just hear slash just ripping his guitar song after song and myles kennedy showing off some of the best vocal range iv heard since rob halford  it is a rare thing for me to like any cd from the first song to the lastthis one does  i can only hope that slash and myles can hang around and do a few more cds and tours together  metal heaven|1
seems im a little younger than the average reviewer here i cant physically say i have been with them from the beginningand female too so let me add my 2 cents if you like well crafted well played music that inspires you to go for long drives and sit in the car listening long after youve arrived at your destination then you will like this album if youre looking for a replay of days gone by and something to relive your youth then go buy a greatest hits complilation this is new music its not as driven as vapor trails not as pop as presto and like many have stated here seems to evoke 2112 without just regurgitating the past this little nugget is something to chew on and savor for a while to come|1
for the microwave or under the short leg of your table or as a shooting target  toothrottingly sugary pretentious overblown commercialized crap from a halfaed sellout 80s band|0
great cd and again they do their rock level best with this cd  i love rush so its a given i will love just about everything they put out  ive seen them in concert 3 times twice during their meager beginnings and just two summers ago with my grown daughter and she loves them too|1
i was not much of a pink floyd until i listened to this record a total work of art the story is about a man who goes through so many problems in his life that messes him up little by little but slowly his mind starts to barricade his feelings and emotions within a wall that starts to drive the man insane i would highly recomend this cd to others and also get it for your self buy it dont hesitate|1
the 80s were without a doubt the worst time in jazz music whenever i see a jazz cd i am not familiar with and i turn it over to see when it was made and i realize it is from the 80s  i cant put it down fast enoughsure there are some exceptions but i would say 90 of the jazz made in that decade was music in limbofor some reason artists lost their backbone and forgot who they were the 80s was a decade of searching of tentativeness a decade lost forever  lets hopehaving said that do not even think of buying this garbageit is crapolla x 100 the wanttobe disco beats alone are enough without mixing in the synth drums and polished vocal transitions yuckif you buy this you deserve to hate it nuff said all i want to know is what drugs were the other two reviewers on when they described this cdps  before you go and say this was made in 1990 not the 80s well dont bother some things are best left ignored  it does not matter this is typical 80s vomit|0
the more we listen to foreign recordings the more we understand that the bolshoi is was and always will be the one and only home of russian opera the history of khovanstchina and the shostakovich instrumentation of it is on my review of the gergiev acount of the opera under the name moskvich since i recomend only the rimskiykorsakov version you should choose one of the three bolshoi recordings made by nebolsin with reizen krivchenia maksakova bolshakov and khanayev 1952 khaikin with ognivtsev krivchenia arkhipova piavko and maslennikov 1974 or ermler nesterenko eisen obraztsova lomonosov and raikov 1988  if you still need the shostakovich version you should choose the soviet film conductor svetlanov|0
i find the wall fantastic ive been listening to it since its release and have always loved it it got lost in my collection until about 6 months ago since ive pulled it out again ive enjoyed it at least another 10 times the wall is definately one of my very favorites i enjoy the movie as well|1
this was a bogus cd with two partial songs crammed into each track  i wouldnt recommend iti was terribly disappointed because the only reason i bought the cd in the first place is that it had a hardtofind song that i am looking for that i planned to use as my wedding song and the version on this album was exactly the one i wanted according to the sample track offered  however theres only 2 seconds of the actual song not enough for the dance so i am out of luckif i could return it i would it was opened though|0
i have owned this kempff set for fifteen years i will not part with it and yet despise it i read the many glowing reviews and approve of their opinions while still believing them the product of a complete misunderstanding why the conflicted point of view sure the brittle sound is not endearing in fact you could argue that it highlights kempffs faults or rather his particular bias my dislike of kempff has very little do with his playing which is unfailingly brilliant and everything to do with his conception of beethoven there are a number of masters a smaller company than can be assumed who by virtue of their transitional position between styles say scriabin a composer straddled between late romanticism and modernism and of course beethoven between classicism and romanticism or because they come to stand for a particular national temperament think of ravel and of the peculiar notion that france is somehow better connoted by descartes and racine than rabelais and montaigne can become imprisoned by the stylistic prejudices of their interpreters which leads me to ask just how much do you love mozart or classicism for that matter you know the precious wit that desperate need to contain excitement within tonal boundaries that borders on the neurotic me not so much and thats why i dislike kempff he has beethoven in a classicist stronghold and will not let go accordingly you would expect kempff to be at his fleet fingered best in the first twenty the so called early period sonatas and he is light airy full of fresh air in his hands unsurprisingly the moonlight sounds less like a romantic dawn than a brilliant return to papa haydn but listen to his appassionata he is so eager so forced and rushed that he betrays the nervousness of one who has entered a world he is not very comfortable in and by disposition he shouldnt be he is only slightly more convincing in the late sonatas which as rosen has shown mark indeed a fascinating return to classicism but even here kempff is so hungry for the light that he misses the shadows and fails to achieve the required gravitas for this i cannot forgive him and nor should i because for me as for others the beethoven of the middle to late periods of the rasumovsky quartets and the grosse fugue of the waldstein and the hammerklavier a beethoven very much of the nineteenth century in other words is beethoven in full caps so if while listening to beethoven youre somehow led to wonder about schubert or schumann avoid this set like the plague buy the remarkable arrau instead or pollini for the late pieces if instead you dream of mozart kempff will not fail you|0
rant onwolf talk by northsound northword presstotal time is 53442 tracks1285422450you have 53 minutes of natureclimate sounds interspersed with wolf howling crying and pack soundsthis wasnt what i expected at all  the wolf sound samples about 30 secondsare loopedtheres about 5 minutes total of actual wolfwolves recording and im probably being generous with 5 minutesone could assume each wolf sample was given letters eg wolf sound a wolf sound b and so onthe sound engineer mixed a b c or d in with whatever the track was focussed on at the moment  wind light rain crickets or birds a here then c then b then a again and so on about every 2 minutes it wouldnt that bad if it werent so blantantly obvious you just heard the same wolf sample 6 to 8 minutes agoid give it a zero if i could but it has a nice crowwindother bird moment midway the 2nd track about a minute and a halfs worth which unfortunately is interrupted by a wolf sample that id heard 4 minutes earlierrant offinstead look for wild wolves by natures rhythms or loups en liberte wailing wolves by jean c roche|0
one of the worst soundtracks ive ever bought simply for the fact that they put all the damn movie es into the songswhy why would they do this this is a musical score  not a damn sound board i cannot express myself angrily enough i am sorely sorry i spent money on this piece of crap i wanted music not the movie thats why i bought the music|0
really the only reason i got this album was because i heard the refrain of your possible pasts and thought it was great and it is but if i had known how boring and unmelodic the rest of the album was i would not have touched it without richard wrights amazing keyboard contributions it just makes this album pathetic and not even a pink floyd album but i do think it is a great roger waters album probably his best i mean even david gilmours guitar work even though hes my alltime favorite guitarist is totally different instead of that bluesy style hes famous for he put in alot of harmonics and scales that are reminiscent of 80s rock n roll which lets all admit sucked nick mason doesnt get to shine like he used to because waters basically forced him to suck if you get the chance buy the dvd pink floyd live in pompeii it really lets you see how great all four members of the floyd werebut anyway the final cut is basically a boring plodding album missing much rhythm and it is the first floyd album to have a song including the word fck which to me is kind of a big deal but anyway i much prefer the wall dark side wish you were here animalsand well all the albums by the floyd before this one|0
after forty years and twenty albums its clear that rush has carved out a unique and enduring place in popular music history  its true that geddy lees voice is a bit of an acquired taste but apart from that it can hardly be denied by anybody that rush is one of the most accomplished influential and successful rock groups everand this may be their best album yeti would even go so far as to say that its quite possibly the greatest rock album of all time  and im not just saying that as some hardcore fan who thinks everything they do is the greatest i actually thought their last album snakes  arrows was just okayat least by rushs standards  so let me try to give some indication of what makes it so greatwhile the songs generally stand quite well on their own clockwork angels is best understood as one long multipart epic  it tells the story of a young man living in a future society ruled by a watchmaker dictating every aspect of the citizens lives and the young mans quest to forge his own path  its probably the greatest dystopian scifi rock vision since tubeway armys replicas or rushs own 2112 and the position of the clock hands on this albums cover is a clever inside reference to that earlier onemore specifically clockwork angels is a steampunk reimagining of voltaires candide how cool is that complete with a voyage to a new world far across the western sea a journey to find a city of gold disaster and shipwreck the works  the final track the garden makes the connection explicitbut rather than merely satirizing leibnizs optimism or rationalistic philosophy in general the album examines some aspects of these ideas more deeply and offers a more specific alternative  the watchmaker of the story is a reference to an omnipotent and omnipresent deity and the clockwork angels are the agents of such a god conceived as a celestial watchmaker hence the albums title  the title track states this idea succinctly lean not upon your own understanding  ignorance is well and truly blessed  trust in perfect love and perfect planning  everything will turn out for the bestbut against this the album is mainly about personal freedom and creating ones own destiny  from the opening tracks line going where i want instead of where i shouldto the opening lines of headlong flight about looking back with satisfaction at both the good and the bad in life all the journeys  of this great adventure  it didnt always feel that way  i wouldnt trade them  because i made them  the best i could  and thats enough to sayand its refrain i wish that i could live it all againfinally rush interprets candides rather obscure reference to tending our garden as a metaphor for our relationships with our fellow human beings in the closing tracks chorus the measure of a life is a measure of love and respect  so hard to earn so easily burned  in the fullness of time  a garden to nurture and protect  this is a beautiful song and as many others have noted if this turns out to be rushs last studio album they will have gone out on a high notethe rest of the songs are excellent too musically as well as lyrically  from the harddriving almost heavymetal steampunk riff of bu2b to the more lyrical acoustic sound of alex lifesons guitar in halo effect geddy lees incredible bass line in seven cities of gold and his vibrant vocal melody in the chorus of the wreckers reminiscent of the best songs from presto  the album feels like a summation of the best of rushs work spanning their entire careerneil peart said of clockwork angels in an interview about a year ago while the album was in progress i intend it to be my highest achievement lyrically and drumming wisehe succeeded|1
solti recorded everything in the orchestral repertoire basically and where his fiery style didnt apply he was mostly lost thats certainly true in these mendelssohn readings which replace grace and charm with cautious routine conducting there are spurts of fire as in the finale of the scotthish but that too misses the mark there is such lovely mendelssohn from karajan bernstein abbado and many others that i would skip this one|0
i got to see kim robertson when she had a concert in tucson arizona back in 198889 her interpretations are lovely and the tone of her harp is mellow not tinny highly recommended|1
its completely beyond me how even one person could say that this is one of the worst albums theyve ever heard or that another brick in the wall is even remotley about not conforming to social or educational beliefs  first i would be extremely proud to say that the wall is at least one of the top ten albums in the history of recorded music as well as dark side of the moon  second the entire album is not about not conforming its about breaking down emotional and mental barriers and overcoming the problems around you  its also not completely about roger waters 75 of what waters and gilmour wrote was actually about syd barret that is if you uninformed listeners even know was the first lead singer of pink floyd until he was forced to be placed in a mental insitution because he suffered from sciczophrenia  third i read a review that mentioned the musicianship being only average as well as the vocals  i would like to say that just because david gilmour is not the fastest guitarist out there does not mean that he is not a incredibly gifted musiscian i know that whoever wrote that review obviously has no idea what to listen for in a song or an album  david gilmour is certainly one of the best guitarists in history and one of the most underrated  also the members of pink floyd did use alot of drugs but obviously and i think a huge amount of people would agree with me on this it did not plague their creativity at all  overall if youre going to even try and say something negative about the wall get your facts straight learn how to appreciate real music and learn a little bit more about music in general before you go around saying that one of the greatest bands of all time created one of the most horrific and intolerable peices of music ever to be exposed to human ears  pink floyd found stunning success with dark side of the moon but this success was even eclipsed by the wall dark side of the moon turned pinky floyd into superstars the wall turned them into icons that will live on in rocknroll history forever as the most innovative and one of the most talented groups in the history of recorded music|1
this is not a collection and its far from essential this is 3 old goodman cds packaged together and called essential each cd is only about 40 minutes long and theres some very annoying narration on cd 1there are much better collections out there skip this one|0
i got this cd set thinking that the narrated sections were on tracks that i could skip if i wanted to this is not the case to listen to the music you have to sit through the dialogue great for teaching kids american history but not for just demonstrating the songs of the time they really should have kept it separated or used detailed liner notes|0
i honestly brought this album for one reason alone  to finally own the extended version of meant for this moment  it was a song i heard as a kid on 991fm in the early 90s and now as an adult i searched and searched for it  finally after two years of searching  it will be mine |0
im not terribly fond of the song say just words despite its popularity among paradise lost fans its not terrible but as a riffpowered song i dont think it holds up compared with some of their earlier work in fact it sounds downright forced and more than a little cheesy the band embraced a new style on the album of its origin one second and i dont think the formula mixes well with this nostalgic throwback to chugging guitar times at the very least fans who are into paradise lost enough to buy this would do well to just buy the album and leave it at that theyll find soul courageous there also and plenty of stronger material the only reason to buy this single is the bside cruel one a relatively weak song that pl guitarists greg mackintosh and aaron aedy have since admitted they detest|0
make no mistake as i did when i ordered this cd set this is a review of the opera doro live recording of semiramide in rome in 1968 it is not a review of the justrereleased sutherlandhornebonynge version on polygrami quit listening after the first 4 or 5 tracks because it was so poorly recorded and miscast what more can i say|0
i am a huge fan of jcs i have several other versions and the reason i got this was from all the glowing reviews that i read here if you are considering getting this version dont it has to be the worst  recording of jesus christ superstar ever the only ones worth getting are  either the original motion picture soundrack or the 20th cast recording  i could barely listen to this recording the only reason i am giving it 1  star is because of the gentleman that does judas otherwise the singing is  3rd rate if that and the music itself is arranged so poorly its not to be  believed  save your money and go with one of the other recordings|0
though this is not my favourite pink floyd recording both dark side of the moon and wish you were here are better in my opinion it is undoubtely a great one i have different editions but i find that this mobile fidelity is really the best one the main difference with the others is that mobile fidelity has taken great care in respecting the great dinamic diferences between the soft and loud moments of the recording this is very important in times of saturated remastering the difference is not subtle and it is worth to buy it though some of the prices for the used cds are exagerated|1
slash  lets face it  if you just went by appearances you would not be impressed  however once he starts playing  wow  the vocals are good  but you buy this for the guitar work|1
riffs are catchy and classic rock and roll best thing  ive heard since appetite vocals are really really powerful great  job slash|1
in spite of the warnings in other reviews i purchased this album because the live special was so funny im sorry to say i am very dissapointed many of the most funny parts of the full concert are not included on this album for example mother and the kids at mall working at mcdonalds they are omitted the cd is still funny but if you are looking for the entire routine you will be very disappointed in this album|0
it is impressive that at this day and age that such a great rock album can still be madein a time where everyone tries so hard and bands take 3 5 17 years to release an album sam mik chad and joe prove that in rnr less is more thanks|1
love clay crosses voice and his love for our lord great cd the songs are some of his best buy it|1
can we please lose the association between this album and the band flotsam  jetsam  should we punish one of the best bands to come out of the trash being produced in the 1990s by mistakenly listing this album among their works  this album relates to a comedy duo in the radio days and has nothing to do with the band|0
a couple of good tracks like because and the medley on the second half content wiseutter rubbish the beatles recorded better whole albums then this the halfassed effort on the last two productions is weak and they show|0
what a joke this record is for one everything sounds the same i know i know every song on every green day album sounds the same but this is especially ridiculous whats the difference between at the library dont leave me and disappearing boy for another billie joe has this godawful guitar tone thats supposed to be heavy but comes off as embarrassing for a third billie joes voice is the aural equivalent of oral surgery without the anesthetics its always been that way though for a fourth their drummer blows hes worse than tre cool whereas tre is merely predictable this guy john kiftmeyer is just bad he screws up everywhere green day going to pasalacqua for a fifth 16 is a ripoff of hello i love you i cant explain and all day and all of the night the triple threat honestly whats so hard about writing your own riff paper lanterns is pretty close to a ripoff too but not quite for a sixth it turns out billie joe had to mature into being a terrible songwriter as evidenced on i was there and 409 in your coffeemaker for a seventh knowledge euh that song is scary its green days take on honkytonk music okay  for an eighth this is green day were talking about here come on this is a collection of several early green day eps and it sucks its punk i guess but its bad punk whats the best song you ask um hey twiddles thumbs for fifteen minutes heres jack with sports|0
krips late 1950s everest recordings of the complete beethoven symphonies were either the first or second integral cycle recorded in stereo followed shortly by stereo sets from herbert von karajan and bruno walter  andre cluytens recorded the symphonies for emi with the berlin philharmonic at about the same time but his set didnt reach the states until the early 1970s  in the early 1960s deutsche grammophon used the von karajan set to introduce the label to the american public by pricing the set at around 20 for the monophonic version and 25 for the stereo version bargains at the time  previously dgg recordings were issued by mgm on inferior domestic pressings  by then belock instrument corp the parent of everest was in financial and legal difficulty after having been found guilty of defrauding the government in its military contracts and it was now easy to find everests selling for 199 each  this is how i accumulated the krips recordings although it was also possible to buy the boxed set for around 15  in a marketing oddity everest originally priced its records at 440 per disc retail while the standard retail price for a stereo classical record in the 1950s and 1960s was 598everest started out as an audiophile label  this was no surprise since belock specialized in designing and building undersea microphones used in submarines  many of the everest issues were recorded by bert whyte who was considered one of the best recording engineers of the time  everest was a pioneer in the use of 3track 35mm magnetic tape and the recordings were wellreceived by critics although the interpretations and performances were less highly regarded after everest went defunct the recording equipment was acquired by mercury the london symphony and the london philharmonic were not particularly good orchestras at the time and the conductors were secondrank at least in terms of public recognition in the states  although everest eventually accumulated a fairly sizable catalogue only the first 60 classical issues are true everest recordings  after the label changed ownership in 1960 it became a reissue label occasionally issuing bootlegs and recordings of dubious origin on substandard pressings  furtwanglers widow threatened suit over the everestolympic furtwangler set of the nine beethoven symphonies alleging among other transgressions that the second symphony was not conducted by her husband  i once owned a fair number of the latter everests including the suspect furtwanglers and can attest to their mediocrityall this is a prelude to my opinion of the bescol set  it is horrid  i bought it in the early 1990s hoping to at last have krips beethoven cycle on cd  and although the set can still be found selling for 10 it is no bargain  the culprit is overuse of nonoise hiss reduction which alternates dead silence in rests with hissy sound when the orchestra is playing  the curious result is that the music sounds severely distorted  far better for bescol to have left the hiss untouched giving the ear a chance to adjust to it as background noise  the hiss not so noticeable on the master tapes is the result of the numerous repressings from the same masters after the original issuesin the mid1990s omegavanguard rescued and remastered the original everest tapes and reissued much of the original everest catalogue on cd  restored to their sonic splendor the everest recordings were warmly received by the critics  the beethoven symphonies were among the reissues and although it appears the everests are again out of print if you are a fan of krips interpretations i would suggest tracking down the omegavanguard set or the much cheaper madacy tin box set  the bescol is acceptable on a cheap stereo or in an automobile but for critical listening it is a travesty of the originals  i have no idea why the bescol set is even still aroundedit june 2014  the krips everests have been resurrected yet again this time on cdr  this time the cds follow the original single lp releases that is to get the entire set it is necessary to buy seven cds  i have no idea about the sound quality  when the omegavanguard set was issued it was reported that the original tapes had already begun to deteriorate  that was two decades ago  it makes me curious about the master tapes used to make the current cds and the madacy set|0
some of their finest moments are on this colourful intricate album the title track with its wonderful solo and shifting time patterns the anarchist with its vivid lyrics and the gentle euphoric flights of the garden taking elements of test for echo vapor trails and snakes  arrows clockwork angels also acknowledges the vast history of rush and journeys into new musical territory it is remarkable that a band can create an album as good as this so far into their career|1
in some sense flyleaf follows a recent trend of rock music which mixes a female vocalist with good range and talent combined with harsh music and subject matter  in some ways like evanescence in others like avril levigne flyleaf at first sounds a bit familiar to jaded ears like my own not bad at all  in fact my first impression of flyleaf was that they sounded great  but not very original on a fuller listening however i found that they were doing it differently than id heard before and better than most of their peers to booton all of the songs  and particularly with songs like fully alive there for you and all around me  there is a lyrical sensibility and an emotional depth that may not be seen initially but they give each song a strong core given life by great vocals and against the backdrop of hardrocking music flyleafs selftitled album quickly becomes a surprising and most welcome addition to a popular wave of musicnow that ive listened to the full cd several times im finding myself coming back to it again and again and anxious to recommend it to friends the last time i felt this way about a new band was when i first heard visqueens king me and flyleaf is sticking with me for many of the same reasons  good stuff|1
this album is quite simply the best rock album in years slash has actually matured as a lead guitarist focusing a tremendous amount on the quality and phrasing of his licks rather than the speed and ferocity that were the trademarks of his youth myles kennedy is a revelation on vocals begging the question at least for me where would gnr have gone with kennedy on vox instead of super talented but megalomaniacal axl rose the sound is tight raunchy punishing gentle and robust this album is a musthave for any true rock fan|1
it seems that some purist rockabilly fans arent too high on burgess original stuff seeing it as too r  boriented and insufficiently hillbillybased  ive never understood that view to me burgess records were the absolute wildest and while they were perhaps not as obviously soupedup hillbilly as most of the recordings made by his sunlabel mates there was no way burgess could ever have been confused with the straightlaced white r n b of early northeastern saxdriven bands  there was always southernbilly in his sound it was just there in a different way than it was in most of the original rockabillies soundanyway burgess southern roots come through in a more variegated way on this cd than they did on the old stuff the basic r n b framework is still there but the tempos are slightly slower and there is more of a straight honkytonk influence on several of the tracks than there could have been in the 50s  a track like hell yes i cheated could easily have come from a mid60s johnny paycheck sessionthe key element making this a musthave release is the improvement in burgess voice since the daynot that there was anything wrong with it in 58  it hasnt actually deepened as much as its gained soul burgess sounds like hes got gravel in his throat but it works and how  burgess injects feeling into every track  while he did the same in the 50s back then it was rather onedimensional his recordings exuded more enthusiasm and excitement than almost anything else anyone did at the time  on this cd burgess does that when necessary but his voice conveys so much more than it once did while still retaining its edginess  sounding as he does today burgess ought to be recognized as an american treasure  given the record industry as it exists thatll never happen which is tragedy  get this and recognize it for yourself at least|1
my husband saw a concert of slash and miles kennedy on tv that he dvrd and just kept watching over and over so i bought this cd for him as a christmas gift  he loves it  its good old fashioned butt kicking rock  roll|1
the album itself is classic 5 stars hands down  but dont buy the remastera previous reviewer already noted that the mp3 version is edited i cant comment on that  what i can tell you is that due to legal wrangling some integral samples have been removed from this version specifically from ready to die machine gun funk and gimme the loot  this definitely makes the remaster inferior  go find the original version at a used cd storeedit amazon removed my links to examples but you can find the original and remastered versions of those tracks on youtube and compareits really too bad that whoever owns these tracks wont do the right thing  its not like biggies profiting from any of this anyway|0
the conceit of this album is that you get 5 songs from a band phantasmic female fronted vocals and 9 songs from fluffy male fronted vocals and 1 song from a band called joe christmas  all of the music on this album could probably be categorized as grunge and the common denominator is a dude named cris colbert i think but the music is messy  it has a disorganized and dischordant quality to it especially the fluffy material  and its not just that it sounds like it was recorded in a garage which it sounds like  for my tastes the phantasmic stuff is by far better and i actually like the cover of billy idols eyes without a face that they pull off always liked the guitars on that one and this version just makes it sound more dirty more distortednot appreciated was the sly way that they snuck a certain fourletter word into one of their songs given that this project comes from an ostensibly christian label  im not offended by it personally but there didnt seem to be any purpose to it other than to slip it in on and presumably past an audience that might knowingly frown on it  consider me frowning  i wouldnt have given this overall a good review even if i hadnt found this therenot really worth anyones time|0
ill get to the point its the bass it comes up waaaaaaay to strong on the opening come together loud enough to blow your woofers i have to make sure the bass control on my marantz is cut back from there it drops down to a more balanced level but not enough on the right songs mccartneys sinister bass runs on i want you should be deep and present but its buried in the mix ive been listening to this album since birth and this remaster is such a disappointment the clarity is quite intimate more than ive ever heard before and the other songs songs are balanced okay i guess but i dont remember which ones now because im so fustrated with listening to this cd its another sign of the times |0
like most crosscultural projects this one falls short in many areas 1 it pairs together two people who probably have little or no prior experience playing together 2 mixes clashing styles that dont blend well 3 are usually rushed recordings to get more crosscultural products on the shelf  then there are the problems unique to this album 1 violin is not a good substitute for erhu the chinese violinjust as the erhu cant capture certain techniques on the violin the violin cant capture certain effects of the erhuand it just sounds silly when it tries to 2 nishizaki is obviously a classical player and the formality of the most formal of western classical music doesnt mesh well with the intellectual pensiveness of good chinese classical musicthere are a few interesting moments here but thats about itfor the most part i would recommend getting either western classical music or chinese classical musicbut not mixing the two which isnt enen the purpose of the project but thats how it comes off|0
the content of this masterpiece is completely inspired roger waters made one of the best albums ever recorded the music makes you feel and imagine what war is and put peace at the highest level in our minds there is a  song for every moment that you could imagine listen to it and find out for  yourself|1
this is not a cd of the original recordings  these are simply horrible musak versions of the real deal  dont touch this collection unless you plan on piping it through an elevator speaker somewhere|0
i feared rushs creative days were over when i heard test for echo in 1997 and especially vapor trails back in 2001 which is in my opinion the worst rush album ever  however they had a decent comeback with snakes and arrows in 2007 which turned out to be a far cry better than its predecessor i think clockwork is their best work in a long time at least since roll the bones back in 91 the album quickly grew on me and i think it shows that the power trio now pushing 60 can still put out a rocker the only fault i find with this release is wish them well the next to the last track it is a sleeper reminiscent of at the speed of love and carve away the stone two rush songs that never should have been i would have to say the garden could easily be classified as one of the bands top 10 best songs ever|1
rush rocked with this album and their setlist for their tour was amazing as well  clockwork angels the anarchist the wreckers headlong flight and the garden are all fantastic songs|1

very soothing and directional  i think that taking out the time to stillmy mind has helped me to make more concrete decisions  i would highly recommend this product to anyone needing more mental and spiritual clarityhappy meditatinggreg  |1
compared to the first album this one leaves plenty to be desiredfor me anyway its wellrecorded but imho the 1st one rocks harder and more plus i think its songs are better i bought itand hopefully will be selling it and sammyif this is the best thing youve ever been involved in musicwise i feel for you the 1st montrose album blows this thing clean off the map|0
as i said about the movie version of the album there is not much left to be said about this album from the many indepth reviews to continue to analyze it further would be redundant therefore i shall just give my opinion in a nutshell this is an amazing album that was very ahead of its time its a beautiful and disturbing album about a rock star who has done and seen it all on the verge of snapping whether you choose to just listen to a few songs or listen to the whole album you should just at least once just concentrate on the deep story take in the lyrics and let it seep into your mind this truly an album to be experienced rather than just listen to|1
or should i say more like chicken kiev full of fillers anyway if you ever had the pleasure of smelling a chicken coop on a hot and humid day this is what youre kinda getting here so lets hold our noses and rip through chickenfoot iii track by tracknote to chickenfoot drop the hippiedippie peace sign logo it just aint happening anymore1 last temptation the opening of this song sounded like something stone temple pilots would have done back in the 90s i did manage to get through this mediocre rock song wont be returning to it2 alright alright  hit the skip button ltyawn3 different devil hit the skip button sounds like rick springfield penned this one4 up next this midtempo rocker has sammy thinking hes going upstairs instead of downstairs shoveling coal not a bad song5 lighten up the opening distorted organ reminds me of deep purple in a way another midtempo rocker nothing special here other than satrianis lead hit the skip button6 come closer hit the skip button fast cmon guys really this sounds like a really lame mid 1980s ballad hey michael anthony runnin with the devil on fire atomic punkwhat happened brother7 three and half letters this is a cool song with good message about hardships in a bad economycant tell if sammy is going hoarse on this one or its an effect this still doesnt make up for track 68 big foot ok now were talking snappy little riff drives this one home great rocking song and i enjoyed the zeppelin reference well be returning to this one for sure9 dubai blues another mediocre rocker wont be returning to it10 something going wrong im feeling a little luke 21628 on this one this song has a back in the bayou feel to it finger is gently rubbing the skip button11 no change hidden track theyre doing a whole lotta lying and im not sure who they are on this one it sounds like they were trying for an early van halen feel with joes guitar panned hard left and echoing right this should have opened the recordwith all the religious overtones on this album it does seem like sammy or someone in the band is searching in my opinion thats a good thingi do give this album a four star rating for mix  mastering production its not overly compressed with virtually no digital clipping  distortion once in awhile youll hear some hard limiting great job on soundcompared to their now rivals van halen and with all the trash talking from sammy last year i now listened to both albums and i must say van halens a different kind of truth smokes this album tenfold i feel chickenfoot iii wont stand the test of time and by next year youll see it in the bargain binhopefully chickenfoot ii will be better|0
the vinyl pressing is defective and of a very poor quality there are too many scuffs scratches clicks and pops its really sad when you consider there are pressing plants in the world today devoted to producing superior quality vinyl records clearly emiapple for reasons unknown to me have chosen a pressing plant with quality control issues  i am very disappointed with the overall quality of the vinyl i can only hope emiapple may produce a second run of pressings and team up with a pressing plant devoted to quality control maybe someone like rti or mobile fidelity sound labs could take control of the pressingsin the world of beatles box sets many editions andor pressings have been produced down thru the years in my collection i happen to own 1 the 1978 parlophone beatles bc 13 blue box set and 2 the 1982 mobile fidelityemi  box set pressed by the victor company  in japan on virgin vinyl  if i were to put aside all questions comments criticisms andor debates regarding the mastering of the recordings and merely focus on the quality of the vinyl  well its easy  the 1982 vinyl pressings are clearly the gold standard  the 1978 pressings come in at second place and the new 2012 pressings are  dead last again i can only hope emi apple might consider a second run of pressings with a manufacturer  devoted to superior audiophile quality|0

claudio abbado and the vienna philharmonic orchesta youd think that combination would turn in an outstanding reading of a bruckner symphony they didnt as the penguin guide said in the only edition that rated this cd abbado was clearly uninspired and the orchestra was on autopilot nothing about this cd suggests anything significant about bruckner or his ambitious first symphony my advice is to look elsewhere for satisfaction in single issue copies sieghart scrowaczewski and tintner are all to be preferred if youre willing to buy a set the two best versions out there are included in the karajan and jochum dg sets|0

clockwork angles has surpassed moving pictures as my favorite rush album  every song on clockwork angels is rock solid  when i listened to it for the first time it sounded a bit noisy but each time i put it on it got better and better  the last song the garden is especially goodwhat these three gentlemen continue to produce never ceases to amaze me  their musicianship and lyrics are better than ever but the thing i love the most about rush is the sincerity that comes out in their music  theres nothing artsy fartsy about these guys  they are for real|1
i had  raffi cdscassettes when my kids were little and we loved them and played them all the time my sister brought them back from the east coast we had not been exposed to raffi before this my daughter just had a baby and i wanted to surprise her with them she will have a great time singing with her kids just like i did still today the people around us are not familiar with raffi so i say give it a try and your kids will love it|1
i must admit im an old school rush fan meaning primarily that i listen to their body of working from 1981 and before with the exception of the wonderful early distant warning1984 yep im that geek who thinks caress of steel is actually better than 2112 but not by much and while i still attend every rush concert i can in hopes of hearing cygnux x1 in its entirety i get bored stiffless by what i consider to be tuneless uninspired drivel tunes rush has offered us the greater part of 30 years sorry diehardsuntil nowwow i cant say how very very exciting emotional shocking fantasticallyretro and wonderously releaseofendorphinsinspiring this new rush album is to me the music is inspired headhaunting in the best way possible by means only rush can give  smart almost mathematical literate and most importantly and particularly with clockwork angels absolute rock n roll im a music buff in my own modest right try radioheads the bends please and its been a while since i listen to a new album exclusively in my car headphones and home over and over again clockwork angels is that album just listening to seven cities of gold as i write makes me think im listening to a track off of fly by night fantasticwhile i wont go into the songbysong review many more thoughtful reviewers will offer i provide this reason every song on this album is excellent i mean that i cant say that about any rush album sorry again dhs well perhaps fly by night but you get what im saying this is a classic albumin closing i got the album simply because i researched the setlist of this tour and the band covers nearly every song on the record i needed to know these song natch before seeing them live so i purchased it and settled down to get to know them but so much more i now love them this album has joined into the soundtrack of my own life this is the best album of the year  this is rock and roll this is rush at their best so do yourself a favor and indulge in this pleasure peace love and equality m|1
im afraid it appears to me that the composer of the musical version of great expectations has no concept of creating mood with music adaptation of a novel to the stage or any kind of hit song or even a ballad  this cd is basically more than fifty songs each less than two minutes in length wherein the actors spew forth rhymeless tuneless forgettable songs with equally putrid lyrics  these kind of interstitial songs usually appear in musicals its just that shows dont usually consist of only these short narrativewithnosenseofmusicality pieces  actually listening to some of the music left me just nonplussed and baffled  this is not what musical theater is supposed to be  if youre looking for a musical adaptation of a classic look for jekyll  hyde aida jane eyre the slightly overplayed but still excellent especially compared to great expectations les miserables or even rent  i gave this recording two stars for some good casting and a couple moments of actual music|0

if you dont like your main vocals to only come out of one speaker right avoid thisits really a shame you have to fork out 250 to get the first four cds in monoof course you get more but those are the only ones you really need  maybe mono masters tooback when they released the original cds the first four were mono then all the rest in stereowith good mixes as far as my ear could tell the past masters also contained mono mixes for someof the songsive been ripping these new 2009 cds to the computer and comparing back  forthso far ive noticed a big improvement except here i literally hate this oneso my new plan is to keep the first four  past masters and upgrade the resthopefully in the future theyll make those first four available in mono by themselvesupdate 91309i have tried the mix to mono suggestion a few other reviewers have mentioned on a mac i usedquicktime pro to export each track to mono on a windows machine you could use a free programsuch as audacity it only takes about 5 seconds for each track i have to say that this isa great idea i realize we all have different tastes and so each of us may prefer these albumsthe way we remember them so if you cant afford the mono set i fit this category for surethen this is the best alternative i still hope emi will make the mono masters availableindividually so until then this will have to do|0

the wall is one of pink floyds darker albums however it is still completely unmissable with two discs that offer 26 songs it is immense by floyd standards and gives us some of their more commercially successful songsthe happiest days of our lives and another brick in the wall sets out the angry detached mood that is present in much of the album as well as these haunting tunes such as hey you and is there anybody out there give the image of a lone voice crying in the wilderness an image that one may frequently envisage throughout this albumnick mason said in his biography of the band that roger waters presented the wall to the rest of the band members as an almost finished project this is very much evident in the dark beauty of the album that was always a hallmark of waters work it is doubtless that the wall is up there with dark side of the moon and wish you were here at the top end of the pink floyd spectrum|1
even though rcas series of recordings dedicated to golden age film composers was by and large wellreceived by critics film afficianados and music lovers this compilation of alfred newmans most popular scores unfortunately did not and still does not meet the standards set by the others some of the blame must be placed with the sound quality muffled and congested a problem first heard in the vinyl release but made even worse by these dull dolbyized digital remasterings just listen to the fox fanfare at the outset and you can hear how the highs are missing listen further to the march from the castille score or the prelude to the robe and youll probably not want to listen anymorein addition to the poor sound which admittedly some listeners can adjust to there are the leaden even lumpy performances conductor charles gerhardt had shown some skill with the film genre in the other releases in the series especially the korngold and hermann discs but here he seems out of sympathy even incompetent if you compare any of newmans ancient  recordings of his own music with the 20th century fox studio orchestra or any hollywood pickup band he recorded with you can hear the difference between a great conductor someone with control over rhythm phrasing balance and overall sound and someone like gerhardt who awkwardly stumbles through the scores as if he were approaching them for the first time listen to the ridiculous gearshifting in the aforementioned march or the confusion due to poor balance and lack of rhythmic control in the other famous march in the robe or to the incoherence at the end of the map of jerusalem compare these same great moments in film music to newmans own performances and you can hear immediately the latters superiority in concept and executionid pass on this one if i were interested in newmans music the original soundtracks available from various sources in honest lowfi sound but conducted by the composer are definitely to be preferred|0
i first heard the songs im so sick and fully alive on the radio and loved them when i found out flyleaf was a christian band i had to go out and buy the cd i didnt think it was as great as everyone else was saying though about half the songs are really good but the rest feel like filler and are kind of boring a lot of people love this band but i think there are better christian hard rock bands out there pillar and red are both better than flyleaf in my opinion but this cd is still a decent buy but listen to the whole album before you buy it to see if you really like that style i didnt get the acoustic versions on the cd i bought but they make this album a better value|1
one of the best rush offerings in many years  headlong flight is awesome as well as the singles that were released early  lately their cds took awhile to grow on me but this one was solid immediately|1
lets say up front that i never bought into the whole david vs sammy thing  i never called van halen van hagar when sammy was in the band  while i loved all of the early van halen albums still do i was just as crazy about the van halen albums with sammy up frontwhats astonishing is just how friggin good sammy still is after all these years  the guy hasnt lost a step  he is incredible on this albumi think it was a great choice sticking with michael anthony and an even better choice bringing on joe satriani  you may or may not recall how david lee roth picked up steve vai when he went solo  probably the only real contender on the planet to set up against eddie van halen  well joe satriani was steve vais instructor  satriani might be the third worthy candidate to roll with these rockersthe way the band comes together on this album is some kind of magnificent  they play together as if they were made for each other  everything is tight and strong  the riffs are awesome the guitar tone exquisite the bass and drums driving in the way vh fans will definitely appreciatealtogether  great album  great songs  and an amazingly fluid and flawless superconcoction of killer talentgreat stuffgreat great stuff|1
the sound of om creates serenity it helps you relax and come to a place where you feel love peace and joy  there are not many meditation cds that use this unique method  this cds om chants and sound effects have consistent rhythm therefore there is not much distraction  the producers introduction is helpful and engaging because it not only includes instruction but some background of his own experience which helps reduce a beginners resistance to the process|1

ok so now we have the beatles swan songfirst off is come together which is your typical lennon song of the periodnot much to say about it its not really too interesting next is something which is an ok songkind of  pretty but nothing special next we have a horrible song by mccartney  called maxwells silver hammer this songs bad even for the beatles its  like your typical paul mccartney broadway type of thing except that instead  of being about his sheepdog martha its about a guy who goes around killing  people with his hammer i guess its suppose to be a funny song ha ha  anywayit is one of the stupidest songs ever recorded next comes oh darlin  which is an ok song sung nicely by mccartney but nothing too great then we  have ringo starr doing another version of yellow submarine except this time  hes in an octupus garden its charming but thats all then i want youshes  so heavy which is lennon singing the title over and over again for about  an hourthe tune isnt too interesting so it makes for a pretty dull song  next is here comes the sun which is actually listenable harrison  thankfully had stopped playing the sitar by this point next is because  which sounds like any other beatle song and its one of those lennon  let me expand your mind songs you never give me your money is  actually a pretty good song sun king is a waste of tape mean mr mustard  and polythene pam are almost as stupid as maxwells silver hammershe came  in through the bathroom window is an alright song golden slumbers and you  got to carry that weight are beautiful the end is a nice finish but then  you have mccartney doing her majesty which was utterly useless|0
although some would call this performance straightforward it lacks the depth and richness of available recordings by fournier casals and rostropovich  before purchasing take the time to listen to the suite no 1 prelude of all four cellists  whereas fournier casals and rostropovich are movingly expressive yoyo mas is on point but lacking emotioni wanted to buy this cd but had no performer in mind  i first chose yoyo ma just because id heard of him  after a quick review of other customer comments and my own test runs i decided to buy fournier casals and rostropovich just because i was excited to hear a familiar piece played so beautifully in three different ways  note that yoyo ma didnt make the cut|0
metalhead4ever death pretty much hit the nail on the head this sounds like avril lavigne and evanescence mixed together which isnt a good thing the grating vocals have already been described the lyrics are generic numetal tripe cristina scabbia could kill this new girl in singing and songwriting the guitar consists of power chords and no soloing why have 2 guitarists if they do the same thing the bassist might as well just quit since you cant hear him the drums arent special eitherall tracks 010avoid this garbage and get lacuna coils new cd instead|0
my grandchildren will listen to this over and over they love the musicality and the words  they know how to operate the stereo 5yrs and 21 months and which slot this cd is in so they dont wait for help to play this cd their parents dont mind they love the music too i highly recommend this cd raffi is an absolute favorite|1
having a modest but effective sound system i was surprised to be not impressed by this version of my fave beatles lpit sounds lumpen bass laden and somehow charmless just another darn moneyspinner for the suckers on the line|0
forget this over produced rubbish if you really care about what this album should have sounded like and what the beatles had originally planned to release when they recorded the music for this set look for the bootleg  cd get back which is far superior to this now capitol get with it|0
something strange is going on in the world first we meet david carter a geologist he is at a dig but he is more interested in the local rocks than dinosaur bones about 65 million years ago it seems that the earths magnetic field switched he is looking for is proof of that eventjordan abellard and jillian brookwood have just started working with the cdc their mentor is a grouchy old man that made it clear that they are basically going to be diagnosing minor illnesses after jordans brother passes away jordan goes on the mission to figure out what happened that leads them to a strange death in florida and another small town where people are getting really sick and dieing for no valid reasonbecky sorenson discovers mutated frogs by her parents house she starts researching them when she is sent off to look into a strange bird migration  although she is initially threatened with loosing her tenure and her frogs it is later decided that she would be the best person to figure out what is going on with the frogs and birdsi had a hard time getting into the book for the first 100 or so pages after that the book just flowed i couldnt wait to see what happened next and thought the ending was a good twist i admit that i am really curious about the possibilities from the results of the pole switch i would like to have learned more about what exactly was making the people illover all this was a good first book i admit that i started reading gods eye and cant wait to find out what happens i think most people will like this story its a great new idea that has lots of possibilitiesi received this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review|1

38 years into their career rush produce one of the best albums of their careersmy personal favourite albums from this amazing band are hemispheres permanent waves moving pictures power windows counterparts and vapour trails plus now clockwork angelsthis is an energetic exciting album with a great story line and fantastic songs to match with perhaps the most beautiful and emotionally uplifting finale closing track the garden the band have ever madethe album flows really well and is as inspired as any of their best stuff from the pasti personally got into rush in 1980 purchasing both permanent waves and hemispheres on the same day every year since then ive thought about making the trip from new zealand to see these incredible musicians liveafter 32 years my wife of 30 years shouted me an early 50th birthday present a trip of a lifetime to see rush live in las vegas on the 23rd november 2012 i was fortunate enough to witness my personal favourite band and concert ever just short of 3 hours of rush live at the mgm where the bulk of this their latest album was playedit was such a great experience and pleasure to see the clockwork angels songs played live as it is an album the guys have clearly put a lot of work into and were really pumped to performing it livei really cannot speak highly enough of this album i really enjoy it and for me it just has so much freshness thought great playing and overall enthusiasm if this sounds remotely like you i hope you get it and enjoy it as much as i do|1
clockwork angels is rush at their best i was very happy to hear a return to their roots with strong guitars and powerful drums as always the lyrics are a bitintellectual to say the least the digital booklet contains fantastic steampunk art this was my first amazon digital album purchase i have to say the process was seamless to integrate the music with my itunes and google music applications and the sound quality blows away anything i have purchased from itunes|1
rarely do i find a cd that i really dont care for or that is worth writing a negative review about  this is one  this is an older arguably historic recording so if youre into that this is for you  if you want to hear george szell play piano or want to hear his interesting but exceedingly brief 351 interview about his training and the old days of recording labeled george szell speaks about acoustical recording and his early studies its for you  otherwise its just not worth the time or money  the sound quality is obviously mediocre and flat given the age of the recording but in some places it is downright screechy and quite distracting  significant portions sound well off key giving the impression that the original i assume it was a tape either got stretched out over time or it was played back for remastering at an off speed or its age should have been compensated for to get it not to sound so whiny  apologies to adam abeshouse restoration and remastering engineer im sure it was much more difficult to do than it even appears in the beginning of track 9 the theme with variations of the trout quintet the ensemble is downright disorganized and not playing together  this would clearly have been recut in a ny minute had it not been a live performance  it pulls together later in that movement and track 10 the allegro does bring it to a solid rousing ending|0
i love everything in the classical kids series except this and the lullabyes  some of the voices of the  characters in this really irritate me  i find the entire cd annoying  the story is simple and dull  i rarely play this one because it bugs me so much|0
disclosure  this is a 2006 revision my review written several years agoin his day carlos montoya a true spanish gypsy was the most famous flamenco guitarist  the operative word being famous  he was a good showman and audiences not knowledgeable of flamenco enjoyed him  however amongst flamenco professionals and serious aficionados carlos  montoya was something of a jokein his very early days as an accompanist c 1933  1942 he was decently adequate  when he  started concertizing as a soloist due to a twist of fate rather than  talent and ability most of what he knew as an accompanist seemed to  disappear  he did things just for showmanship rather than for the music  and his greatest sin was that he constantly butchered the compas  ie  the particular rhythmic meter that most flamenco forms demand  compas is  one of the absolutes within flamenco and no artist can call himherself a  professional much less be respected if heshe cannot keep a decent  compas  for this reason alone carlos montoyas playing always drove the  real flamencos to distractionthe true virtuoso of carlos montoyas generation was sabicas who unfortunately never attained nearly the same  degree of fameso   many people may well enjoy this and carlos montoyas other albums  but  be advised that none of his albums represent anything close to the best  flamenco guitar playing either in his own generation or any generation  sincenow another note im adding in this revision  all that said carlos montoya still had a passion in his playing and that despite the above flaws is what always came through  and beyond his playing in my own experience carlos was affable playful and muy simpatico  the few times i met him he was always very nice  during my jose greco days he sat in the front row at one of our conerts and he was kind and complimentary afterwards about my solo  that sort of generosity should not go unacknowledged  now that he and jose  and sabicas antonio gades juan maya mario escudero and so many others  have passed on the flaws should not be buried but the memory should be with respect and kindness  i certainly will always remember montoya in that way|0
instead of hitting the dreaded sophomore slump chickenfoot decided to go ahead and name their 2nd album iii  as with the first album chickenfoot iii is exactly what you would expect from a band that features sammy hagar joe satriani chad smith and mike anthony  no holds barred classic party rock with the occasional more serious lyric thrown in for good measure  hagars voice is still amazing at his advanced age and satriani can still shred with the best of them  mike anthonys background vocals along with satrianis pyrotechnics make many of these tracks sound very similar to hagar era van halen  overall i think the songwriting on this one is quite a bit better than their debut  highlights include up next three and a half letters big foot and dubai blues  some of sammys lyrics are actually rather cleaver and thought a bit beyond his his usual good time hagar party songs  if you liked the first album i would think you would like this one  if you did not like the first one you might want to give this a chance as it is a rather significant improvement|1
his rhythms are impeccable  his voice is a smooth  gentle hero  get this cd  let it take you away|1
this brubeck time out remastered is not and audiophile recording  the audio is muddy and lackluster  perhaps an overused stamping mother was used or perhaps some overly aggressive noise reduction between the master source and the lathe compare this to an original columbia brubeck pressing and you will hear a vast difference  the originals are bright and warm and sound almost like a direct to lathe recording  even the 1974 all time greatest hits compilation has astonishing depth  this new remastered recording sounds like the signal passed through a wet blanket somewhere in the audio chain or as if it was mastered from a commercial cd copy  on the plus side the packagingcover is a terrific and faithful representation of the original and the material is  well its brubeck so its great but the audio is just not good at all  i had high hopes for this album given all the new technology out there but any brubeck fan or true audiophile will be greatly disappointed as i was|0
ok when roger took over the sound might have not have been pink floyd but there was some classic floyd here admit it  im not saying that the final cut was a good album im just saying that this isnt as bad as almost all floyd fans say infactit rocks it starts with a pink floyd show pink floyd is the fictional character in this story then it goes back to his birth baby crying it then kicks into his childhood problems dad dieing in war abusive schoolmasters overprotective mother unable to deal with young lust then his gilrfriend leaves him and the pain of being alone is the last straw and pink floyd goes insane then on disc 2 pink floyd reaches out to the troubled youth in his music and becomes a successful rock star with lots of pride but his paining memories still haunt him then he uses drugs to calm himself but thinks get out of line at his concert the same concert where our story begins then he realizes it needs to stop and after a trial in his mind it ends and he goes outside the wall oh i forgot the wall is an imaginary thing that isolates pink floyd from the rest of the worldas for the music rockin in the flesh is 1 of those songs not nearly heard enough another brick in the wall is a classic  an anthem for anyone who hates school  ok i dont feel like going thru the rest of the songs but trust me theyre good and i know some songs seem like filler but its only to contribute to the story|1

i firmly agree with the previous poster who called this album mediocre perfect choice of words this album is indeed quite mediocre of course the postwaters albums are worse than this but thats not saying much this album is total crap crapola the vocals are wooden and uninteresting with warmedover 70s heavy metal obviously pigs on the wing 1  2 is nice but as has been pointed out can be obtained on the internet in combined form of the three central compositions pigs is the only very listenable track but like the others it suffers from its needless length dogs is absurdly turgid and sheep is unconvincing and illconcieved when you come down to it this album is nothing more than three insanely bloated compositions that wouldve been better as fiveminute songs each avoid|0

i did not need another otello much less one with the same otello as my other one i guess it was cheryl studer that lured me into this and indeed her performance is good more than capable but not greatthis is not the best otello of domingo on recordfor me that would be the one with milnes and scotto a cast that i saw perform it on several occasions and each performance was rapturous two problems with this set there is no chemistry between the performers and more important it is sloppily conducted chung conducts as if he is late for something and is hurrying to get out of the studio and on to his next appointment the first act flies by so fast it seems to be over before it beginsanyone want to buy a second hand copy|0

when i was in high school this was my favorite album i grew up in a really backwater town and it wasnt until i went to college that i started to meet people who were familiar with it the overwhelming popularity of it  that i encountered diluted its power some albums work better as universal  statements that everyone connects with some work best as obscure isolated  records because of the nature of this album having everybody like it  undermines pinks im alone in the world viewpoint also  seriously disappointing is that so many people have no idea what exactly  its aboutits a combination on three issues roger waters struggle with  the wall of understanding between him and the audience syd  barretts fall into drugs and insanity and roger waters father dying in  world war iiin hindsight theres too much filler or  transition songs especially in the middle and not enough  major songs its too bad that the final cut didnt get more  recognition it covers much of the same territory but with much more  maturity and intensity|1
cbslegacy should be ashamed of this madetoorder mass produced cd  my track 6 is in fact track 10 and so the cd track listing continues out of sync randomly for the rest of the disc  if this is how multinationals want to save money then shame on them  duke ellington is not just an american institution hes an international institution he deserves more respect than this tawdry ripoff cd no wonder pirating is out of control|0
this record is very guitar driven duh and got me interested in alter bridge as well as guns n roses again since slash and myles perform several songs from appetite for destruction in their concerts  it is interesting to note how much work slash has done since guns n roses and how much work axl has done since slash left guns  if you like straight forward rock with two guitars and songs that do not make you think too much this record is for you|1

this man has a voice of unearthly beauty his themes are soulful and he sings them with exquisite feeling many of them are protest songs in one sense or another as true calypso often isand what i love about this man is that he was an original rebellious spirit who understood history in a very profound wayconsider the time  not the 60s or the 70s but the 40s imagine this man singing at that politically charged time with all the labor unrest and the slowly growing movement for independence   about going to a shango ceremony that by the way is the most beautiful song on the album and the song is so respectful  he does not sing of shango as something savage and creepy which would have been the dominant racist attitude at the time  i couldnt help comparing it to sparrows congo man which catchy as it is perpetuates racist stereotypes about africanness but simply by integrating a shango melody within his song communicates something of the beauty and spirit of shango to us  i am amazed by the extent to which his melodies are rootsy  very uneuropean full of african retentions african melodies including the phrase going back to africa permeate many of these songs in a much more obvious way than with other calypsonians of the time and none of this is selfconscious borrowing in the way you see people do it post 60s i think he had a genuine respect for what he heard being sung among his elders and did not try to erase its rootsiness or embellish it for western tastes this album is a treasure not just for lovers of calypso but for for labor historians and those studying african retentions among the diaspora|1
this man is absolutely hilarious if you have not heard of him you are truly missing out on perhaps the funniest oberservational comic his cd which is finally available on amazoncom is guaranteed to bring you to tears|1
i was looking for the sacd version which i entered into the search this is the disk that came up so i purchased it disappointed to find it was a remastered standard red book cd next time i will use a more reputable music source as to not be mislead i would think that if i entered the the title and sacd it would not show anything if the match was not exact|0
pretty much what you would expect from a slash album  unlike the first one instead of having a guest singer for each song he sticks with myles kennedy through the whole album  quite frankly the two myles kennedy songs at slashs first solo album were my favorites anyways  if you like gnr and velvet revolver you will not regret this purchase|1
this cd is pretty good but not amazing if you want something you can play with your children or grandparents then this is for you personally i find pablo fransisco more talented regan is not as funny as other comics  if you only have enough money for one cd i would recomend mitch hedberg dane cook steven wright robert klein or even austin peterson|1

on this cd as always perlmans playing is nearflawless and previns orchestra is powerful and precise  so i dont really know what went wrong  it sounds as though both artists are trying to make the music too romantic sure mendelssohn was a romantic composer but he was still mendelssohn  he was lyrical but he never gushed as is the case here  it also seems as if perlman and the orchestra are never quite together which is hardly noticeable but disturbing nonetheless  i really wish ruggiero riccis recording of these concertos with the lso was still available now thats quality  as it is isaac sterns recordings of these concertos while they must be purchased separately are better overall i think|0
sorry but the euphoria of listening to beatles music has to be set aside for some hard facts many tracks are inferior in sound to the recently released 1 and something newi cant explain the drastic sound difference on the 2 cds a hard days night in the new remaster is very clearly rough and muddled compared tothe track in 1 tell me why  im happy just to dance with you sound much better in something new the recently released capitol albumcant buy me love is punchier and clearer in 1 while the stereo versions are preferable to the mono ones previously released it seems themaster tapes have degraded significantly in just a few years since the release of 1 and capitol masters last but not least no version of a hard days night is complete without the instrumentals which have never been release in the us its easy to miss these differences when just playing the cd start to finish i expected the remasterings to be better than 1it turns out that was not the case|0
i dont think so at least not on this album  the opener is good in typical fashion everthing that follows is a slow love song  not exactly rock  since a hard days night is good i gave it one extra  star|0

ok this is a great album it used to be my favorite album in fact but i do not think that it is the best album of all time nor is it done as well as it could have been some of the things about this album that make me  think it is far less than perfect are the vocals they truly dont match  the mood of the lyrics they do on some songs but other they do not i do  like all the songs i just dont think  theyre done the way they should  have been they dont follow the concept of the album its especially  noticable on the trial it sounds good but it does not fit in  i dont think  in my opinion and no one has been able to convince me  otherwise i feel that the downward spiral or the  fragile both by nine inch nails trent reznor are the best albums of  all time they are both concept albums in a way tds definitely is and the  fragile is more of a flowing album than a concept album but both are  perfect in every way i cannot honestly think of any way they should be  changed the vocals fit so perfectly with the song everything is perfect  with the song there are tons of back ground noises and they all just fit  together so well also the downward spiral tells the same type of story as  the wall except it does it much better than pink floyd did  anyways i  highly reccomend the wall i reccomend the downward spiral  and the fragile far more highly thobut the end of waiting for  the worms is done perfect i love it its just perfect|1
i chose this cd as a gift and have listened to it as well it is pretty cleanfew if any cuss words my husband listened to it in the car with the kids and now they are constantly ing the cd take luck and nobody look at me im a moron etc it makes a good gift for parents or people you dont know that well like your sisterinlaws new boyfriend|1
with clockwork angels i feel like my rush has come back to me  i am an old guy and a longtime rush fan way back when the vast majority did not know rush  this is not a thorough review of clockwork angels but bear with me  just giving a different perspective2112 was my first in high school and listened over and over  then caress of steel over and over in first semester of college in 1981  would let the album play overnight while i slept  then picked up fly by night which is nice and raw and the title track fly by night stuck in my mind  a farewell to kings was dam good and remember liking closer to heart before the live version became a hit laterand then hemispheres became my favorite of the rush albums  still is  and then the awesome songs the spirit of radio and free will off of permanent wavesand then moving pictures  i could not believe it  an incredible album late in their career  i enjoyed each and every song while maybe cliche limelight is still likely my fav rush song but others on moving pictures are so good too but never forget each and every word and note off of the first side of the 2112 album the album that got me hooked on rushand signals wasnt bad  i liked it  but after that rush started to lose me  likely more me and my closemindedness than rush  indeed i have recently been relistening to some 80s and 90s rushwith clockwork angels i miss geddys highend hits on the voice from the early years but i do definitely recognize rush again  they have come homemy ranking opinion only of their studio albums starting with their best1  hemispheres 19782  2112 19763  moving pictures 19814  caress of steel 19755  clockwork angels 20126  permanent waves 19807  a farewell to kings 19778  fly by night 19759  signals 198210 rush 197411 counterparts 199312 grace under pressure 198413 presto 198914 power windows 198515 snakes  arrows 200716 roll the bones 199117 vapor trails 200218 test for echo 199619 hold your fire 1987|1

im a huge fan of philip glass and have collected many of his works listening to them frequently as a writer by trade i generally find his compositions unobtrusive and often complementary to my working process however i was sincerely disappointed when this arrived in the mail i had thought i was purchasing an album containing music and nothing else when in fact it is essentially an abridged version of the film in an audio formati guess i should have listened to the sample audio on the page but i was fooled by the word soundtrackin the amazon title isnt a soundtrack usually music from a filmthe music is certainly there and its wonderful if youre a glass fan but throughout the entire cd it plays exclusivelyexcept for one twominute trackas background to the voices of those being interviewedi should state that i have seen the film at least twice and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in documentaries or the works of errol morris it is an important and fascinating work by a talented filmmaker and it won many deserved awards when the film was released in the late eighties however i would have thought that its soundtrack would have left the interviews to the film and focused 100 percent on the music|0
this is a great cd myles kennedy and slash rock it outso buy your copy today and jam thanks|1
ive listened to this album many times  ive tried to give it a chance  i just dont see this as her best work  after a while all of the songs begin to sound the samethe most moving song on the album is  visitor from heaven about wendy hope a baby girl who lived  just a short time in the fall of 1991many of the songs seem too  contrived or unnatural  its as if paris is trying too hardi mean  twila no disrespect  i like her music  while i do not hesitate to  recommend her other work im unable to speak as highly of this recording|0

matthew johnston is correct on the misnamed el original matamoros the original 1930s recordings have been dubbed over with new guitar and bongos there is no need for this  the original recordings are excellent as isdubbing guitar over matamoros is roughly equivalent to do doing the same to robert johnson or john lee hooker  in other words ridiculousthe musicians doing the dubbing are actually quite talented but as there is no way they could remove the original guitar and bongos the new parts clash with the older there are also extreme sonic differences between the new and older recordingsthe best matamoros tracks are from their earlier trio years their later conjunto material is not as noteworthy the spanish label tumbao has put out some excellent matamoros collections two particularly good compilations are titled la china en la rumba and the legendary trio matamoros  unfortunately tumbao cds are not available on amazon in the usa both titles are however available through amazon uk but listed as unknown label you may also be able to find tumbao cds through other us retailers|0
such a frustrating performance  on paper this stellar cast should have replicated the 1968 performances of the opera at the vienna state opera but by the time columbia records recorded the opera in 1971 with a mostly similar cast something was clearly lost  christa ludwig is a surprisingly or maybe not assured marschallin even if a bit stretched walter berry is a delight as ochs and lucia popp is just wonderfully ideal as sophie  even placido domingo makes a welcome appearance as the italian tenorso what brings this set downwell despite my undying love for gwyneth jones oktavian i have to admit this is easily the most painful performance that i have ever heard from a beloved artist committed on a studio recording  as one reviewer wrote when the recording first came out she starts badly continues badly and ends badly  the music and the listeners ears take quite a beating especially towards the end of act i  the loss of control of her voice in between those three years is simply appallingleonard bernsteins conducting also come under a lot of criticism but mostly his broad approach actually works for a good deal of the timethat is when ludwig popp and berry are singing  these three singers can actually cope and make bernsteins tempi work especially with the stunningly beautiful playing of the vienna philharmonicwhat a missed opportunity bernstein ludwig berry and especially jones would benefit if ever a recording company would release the live 1968 performances to better represent their artistic contributions|0
this cd was a very good price and i feel now that i got what i paid for 298 and regret not having paid more for a better recording i can hear mistakes in the repetition of the whale sounds and the whale sounds do not sound natural in rhythm they seem to continue too frequently within a repeated loop also there are some parts where a sound was started and then quickly stopped then started again with earphones on i am sensitive to these kinds of sounds and hear the mistakes in addition the surf is quite loud that is fine except that my mind is on the surf at that moment and then i hear deep water sounds of whales which take me to the deep sea am i on the beach or listening to whales in the sea for listeners who are especially critical and want to hear convincingly natural sounds dont bother buying this cd for those who are not particular and just want to hear general sea sounds it might be ok for a good deal|0
it isnt the same after two decades this cd is insipid boring and flat  the only remarkable song is summer nights|0

basically music is the center of my line of workthat said i take it very seriously and i feel safe in assuming i listen to more music in a year than most people do in a lifetimein a world where the words legendary and masterpiece are certainly used much too often it is hard to discern true greatness from simple hypei choose these words very carefully in reference to artmusic and in the case of music i can surely count less than 10 truly legendary artists within the classic rockrock genre of post 1960the group pink floyd is on that list and this album is a true piece of art that can be called a masterpieceif you are a true music lover and your preference is classic rock then you will own this album at some point in your lifeeven if you think you wont eventually you will in one form or anotherit is almost inevitableso i feel no need to say buy this album or you must own this because i know that if you appreciate this type of music it will find you long before you find itin time the true legends always shine above the rest and their light does not fade it only grows strongerand you will learn to appreciate this at some point in your lifeso one day you will be driving down the road late at night on your way home and you will pop this cd in the radio and you will say to yourself this group has true greatnessand you will understandfew have indeed reached this level of musical art i believe led zeppelin have in their own way along with certainly the beatles and the rolling stonesand only a very select few other than thisin my opinion it can only be explained by simply saying works of art such as the wall dark side of the moon the white album exile on main street led zep iv etc are what other musicians in this field will always aspire to and compare their lifes achievements againstas artists do in regards to the mona lisa or athletes will in regards to michael jordanand on a final note i will predict that one day many many years from now the works from the likes of pink floyd the beatles led zeppelin john lennon and the rolling stones will be at the very top of the list of most sold music on the earthyou must understand it is inevitablethey will truly shine on|1

the fact that abbey road stinksis to me far too obvious to be ignored any longer saying this is not an attempt to make myself interesting i agree that the beatles made more evergreens than any other band i love most of their material the magic touch is however almost totally missing on abbey roadjohn lennon is the one that disappoints me the most on this album frankly he sounds more like a sleepwalking junkie than anything else how dare i taste this john lennon had at this point of his carreer little or absolutely no interest whatsoever for the beatles this is not a theory its a factlennon starts the album with come together its his best song for this album but far from good it sounds as if john is laying in bed and he probably was singing this somewhat lame unfocused an uninspired song the lousiest opener for any beatles albumharrisons something is the albums true classic possibly one of the ten best beatles songs evermaccas maxwells silver hammer is obnoxious and deservedly so his worst ever song for the beatles oh darling is a better effort from paul great vocal performance but not much of a song just a 50s pastiche like thousands of others uninterestingringos octopus garden i could say this belongs in a kindergarten if it wasnt for my deep respect and sympathy for those poor kids if anyone really likes this grow upand the worst is yet to come the absolute hairraising i want you shes so heavy must be lennons ekvivalent to maxwells as his worst ever beatles song keyword catatonic stupor this song makes me scream please let me out of thisharrisons here comes the sun a lovely song though not a classic in my opinionsounds totally out of place in the company of this garbage with this and something george alone saves this album from a total catastrophythen comes lennons because absolute rubbish a sleepwalkers song if there ever was onepauls you never give me your money starts out pretty promising but soon looses direction completely its more like a medley of unfinished half baked ideas than a song which is ok if it makes sense an adds up this doesntrest of the elbum is pretty much like that medleys of unfinished song and short fragments calling this a suite is a complete mistake three more songs from lennon follows on a row sun king is the sleepwalker again it hurts to hear lennon in this terribly apathic selfcontained state the two next songs mean mr mustard and polythene pam are faster but ecually horrible they are nothing less than a pouting insult against everything the beatles represented at their bestafter this lennon disappers and mccartney takes over the control for the rest of the album he has nothing much to offer at least not a decent song there are some promising fragments here but they never develop into songs golden slumbers starts out quite promising but suddenly there comes carry that weight that is no song at all just a silly irritating refrain that makes me think of football mccartneys attempt to make some sense of the mess by repeating the opening theme from you never give me your money is not a bad idea but neither is it a brilliant one the jam and the drum solo especiallyin the end i find dreadful the song itself is nothing but the briefest fragment popping up from nowhere and disappearing just as fast her majesty that ultimately ends this album is just a short throwawaywell this album sure isnt much of an offering is it so why the universal acclaim of it i believe it has a lot to do with peoples need for a good story and a happy ending the greatest band ever comes together and make their final masterpiece that sounds just so beautiful so right it cant possibly be any other way can it to be honest i have actually myself sung the praise of this album out of pure magic thinking even if i knew there was something fundamentally wrong herealmost 35 years after its release it must be time to reconcider the quality of this album rock as an art form deserves itthruth is folks the beatles last recorded album is a stinker|0

despite a love of shuberts symphonies and hurwitzs praise i find myself disappointed with this disc to be honest i do not know if it is blomstedts performances or the symphonies themselves as these are the only recordings of 1  2 i have heard given that it just doesnt seem that the music of these early symphonies takes off the way it does in beechams 3 5  6 disc or gunzenhausers 4  symphony in c disci end up drifting elsewhere rather than listening which is something i do not normally do with shubert early or otherwise i suspect that these symphonies are inferior to the rest but i also have a feeling blomstedt is a bit stolid herei may have to get halaszs 1  2 naxos to be sure|0

good album for the kids i guess but it gets old real quick for the adults  first of all its so loud  i mean the way its mastered  i made a mix cd for my kids for the car and the songs on this disc are waaaay louder than any others  i also dont understand the love for the first toymakers to the king  i wouldnt have included the song at all as its not very good and not very christmassy and yet they have two different versions here  also why couldnt they have used any songs from the year without a santa claus  this would have earned a fivestar rating if they had included the heatmiser song  they would have benefited as well from some material from twas the night before christmas  the one with the mice and the clock  another rankinbass production|0
this recording was made shortly after mr hampson sang his first performances of the title role at the metroplitan opera a critic in the ny times had the gaul to compare hampson to the great met giovannis siepi and pinza as john wayne might say not hardly hampsons affected and monochromatic singing characterize this entire recording from top to bottom the cast is colorless and soporific save for barbara bonneys charming zerlina there are substantially superior recordings available and for a lot less money try the classic london label recording with siepi corena and della casa with krips conducting there is real mozart singing and playing if you must have hampson get one of his song recital cds in which he uses the microphone to full effect|0

actually the quality of sound is not good enough i dont know whether it is remastered or not but sound performance is rather poor and does nor have relation with the great accardo perhaps the best paganinis performer in violin the orchestra sound sometimes over bassed and sometimes drowning the violini would rather choice the british concert with trevor pinnok also fermormed with accardo this last version sounds in the proper way|0
i would recommend this cd to a student studying the score and wishing to hear as many of the instrumental lines as possible but not to anyone else  the chamber orchestra of europe is an absolutely firstclass ensemble and its playing is caught superbly by finlandias engineers  i just wish that berglunds conducting lived up to the standard set by the playing and recording  unfortunately as thoughout this cycle he seems to be going dourly through the motions offering not even a glimpse of sibeliuss genius  i would suggest bernsteinnyposony in the sixth symphony and maazelvpodecca legends in the fourth for thrilling stereo interpretations of these symphonies  if you want to hear a finnish conductor try osmo vaumlnskauml on bis|0
my introduction to flyleaf was actually unintentional i was checking out at a local music store and the guy behind the counter kept insisting that i pick up the flyleaf ep that was out at the time i had no idea who they were or what they sounded like but to shut him up i put the few bucks down and in exchange discovered a damn fine new band as i heard the first song im so sick which like all the songs on the ep reappears here i was hooked the vocals of lacey mosley were not only hardhitting but also intriguing and sweet at the same time there sure arent a lot of good female fronted hardrock acts out there but flyleaf are definitely one of themnow over half the material on their selftitled fulllength debut is recycled material from the debut as reproduced by howard benson cold hoobastank so i have to admit it wasnt as exciting listening to this as it was the ep and another thing i must admit is that the ep was actually better due to the lower production values the songs had more charm and just hit a lot harder here a lot of the music is overproduced and just doesnt have that same spark but if youve never heard anything to compare this album to im sure you wouldnt think the same the great thing about flyleaf is that they cant be categorized you cant say they sound like x band because really they dont its a bit numetal its a bit alternative and laceys vocals are often angry but never distorted or processed the girl has some powerful pipes and definitely outshines some other male frontmen in the genre its hard to imagine how flyleaf would sound like with some dude front and centerthere isnt much variety on the album but that can be forgiven because this is just a debut and a damn fine one at that the strongest songs are im so sick im sorry all around me and the ballad there for you which features dave navarro on guitar if you are depressed by the lack of good female vocalists in the genre then flyleaf will serve as a worthwhile listen perhaps on their next album they will show a little more range but as it stands theyre onto something good|1
loved this cd been looking for it for a long time now brian regan is genius much obliged the big yellow ones the sun|1
only the first 6 songs are beatles songs the rest are instrumental orchestrations from george martin that were used as score music for the yellow submarine animated film done without any beatle involvement other than the songs which were used of those 6 only 2 could be said to be beatles greats yellow submarine and all you need is love and you can get those on other discs the transcendent revolver and magical mystery tour respectivelyall together now is the only other tune that sticks with you and its a paul tossoff thats even lighter than the cds title track its almost impossible not to sing along with it though making it a keeper even if its not a great lyric hey bulldog has a great musical groove but its not really all that good a tune georges its all too much is decent but not up there with his best material here comes the suntaxmanwhile my guitar gently weeps and way too long at 6 12 minuteslows include its only a northern song which just sounds like a mishmash of noise recorded to sound trippy i can only be thankful to the gods of rock that this failed to make the cut for sgt pepper the martin instrumentals are ok but unremarkablenothing as instantly memorable as say taras theme from gone with the windbottom linean essential rock collection doesnt have to have this one but if you want all the beatles songs this or the songtrack blue coverasin b00000k4es version is necessary the merits of the songtrack are much debated the tracks there are remixed with the vocals centered and many people argue heatedly that the originals found here are vastly superior best bet is to borrow both from your local library and compare them side by side to see which one you like best2 12 stars|0

the 2009 remaster is not worth buying unless you dont own the same album already on cd you are an audiophile who is willing to pay big bucks for small improvements you like collecting stuff and want the cardboard and booklets that come with the new versioneveryone who is saying there is a dramatic audible difference between this release and the previous cd is wrong im not saying their opinion differs from mine im saying theyre wrong thats a strong statement and ill try to back it up without getting too geekythe beatles remasters are a little louder than the 1987 cd releases music sounds better as its turned up a little louder up to the point where it starts to annoy the listener most people dont have a way to exactly volumelevel the two releases to compare them thats why they think the new ones are so much improved when theyre only slightly improvedltgeek mode onconventional wisdom is that most people cannot detect a loudness change of less than 3 decibels thats not quite rightmost people cannot detect a volume change of less than 3db as a volume change they can hear the difference but they think its something other than a difference in loudness they think theyre hearing more detail better bass etcand they are because you can hear everything better when its louder and youll like it better up to that annoyance pointwhen you go to an audio store to buy speakers the salesman typically has a vested interest commission in steering you toward a particular speaker the unscrupulous ones will set things up so their pet speakers are 1 to 2 decibels louder than the others  they dont push it too far or people will detect that its a loudness difference and ask to turn up the other speakers that the salesman wants to steer you away fromthe differences between the old and new recordings are not large and the new recordings certainly havent been ruined by being made a little hotter you can easily measure the volume differences by ripping the albums to your computer with a program that can compute replaygain values the differences on most of the beatles tracks areless than 3 db see where im going with this the new recordings are louder but not enough louder for many people to perceive the difference as a loudness differencefor example the 1987 version of come together from abbey road has a track replaygain value of 288 the remaster is 393 or 105 db louder in the replaygain scale things get louder as the negative numbers get bigger many horribly limited modern pop recordings have replaygain values of 8 or worse uncompressed audiophile classical recordings typically have replaygain values near zero or even a db or two above zeroi ripped the new beatles remaster to flac lossless format storing replaygain values and compared the new recording to my 1987 cd copy through a logitech squeezebox with smart gain enabled this means i was able to listen to the new and old recordings at the same volume level i also played them against each other with volume leveling off and done this way its easy to see why most people prefer the new releaseltgeek mode offwhen volumematched the difference between the old cds and the new remasters is audible and minimal and occasional the most obvious difference is a slightly less restricted lower endwere owed better than this for all this money and hype at the least we should have gotten something as good as the yellow submarine remixes nobody who has heard eleanor rigby from that remix will ever confuse it with the original or prefer the original love and the yellow submarine remix and let it be naked and the damn xbox game prove that the people who own the original tapes can do better and they know ittheyre milking us are you a cow|0
a very good album  rush usually delivers but this one is a step up from usual  this cd is the best next thing to being there live|1
i cant understand the babble about elgars unfinished symphony there is no such thing elgar never even got the first movement properly underway having read all the prose that accompanied the first publication of this symphony it seems that noone is bothered by this outright publicity fraud the wish is truly the parent of its promise yet at least the honest arranger payne himself stressed that he wrote the work in as close an imitation of elgar as he could  not pretending that elgar really had a hand in it if you dont mind me saying the same as if constable had painted a haystack in the corner of a canvas plus three or four pencil marks elsewhere and now some academic paints a full canvas in the masters style and exhibits it as a constable would never get away with it in the art worldin a word the proper title would be anthony payne a symphony on themes of edward elgarnow if this interests you fine  go ahead and buy itbut i dont appreciate the stunt of putting elgar symphony 3 in big letters on the albums cover because no such animal can be found on the discin the world of art where constable trades for millions they might even cut out the haystack and frame it separately but no such courtesy or piety for elgarthe two stars are purely for the performancei hope mr payne continues to live happily in the borrowed light of elgar hearing his own symphony performed and recorded so often despite the false pretences|0
this was a great find im glad i found this cd on amazon for my husband he loves it and wont stop playing it|1
i thought this movie was supberb as was the music it is even more timely with the events in indonesia today lo and behold i was amazed that the main song  from the film was not included in the cd can anyone offer where to find it|0
the biggest problem with brian regans cd is that there is only one of them i would be a lot happier if this were a 10cd boxed setmany have mentioned that his humor is family friendly and thats true and rare but please dont think this means it isnt hilarious for adults  just the opposite i appreciate a comedian who can make me laugh out loud and yet doesnt resort to easy risqueacute topics and foul language to try to get a laugh thats lazy craftsmanship and its nothing special at all just pop on comedy central for ten minutes this man does the job and does it better than anyone else in comedy today without being crude if he played live locally id bring everyone i know to the showthe memory of one of his live acts on dvd just popped into my mind  background sound effects during a game of golf  and i just broke into a grin again thinking about itthis past weekend we lost power for two days my kids were going through electronic entertainment withdrawal the only thing we could get going was a boom box and all they wanted to hear was this cd they played it three times in a row normally i would be screaming please not again but i found myself still laughing the third time through even though i practically know this disc by heart already mr regan if you read this im begging you to commit more of your talent to cd oh and my tenyearold says he makes really good whale sounds me im still laughing at the proper pronunciation of your name its briyonnei give this cd seven stars out of five and then take one back because it doesnt have a sequel yet|1
unbelievable  listen closely to the lyrics of this band  bridging the gap from christian to mainstream without selling out flyleaf is thrilling and original  recommend for all listeners|1
this can be bought cheaper around eighteen dollars as a reissue on top of the music for the royal fireworks you also get the full water music etc just type in asin b0000042hn youll be glad you did|0
in the development of rock this album reached a new nadir and  believe me it had lots of competion from led zepplin yes free and all the other stadium fodder where did all the excitement go the creation and release of rythmic tension which had been rocks signature instead we find lyrics with a pretension to depth and which are in fact staggeringly banal we find music of leaden obviousness the antidotes dylan neil young the band the clash the sex pistols you know music with a pulse instead of musical necrophilia|0
raffis a classic lots of fun songs about just about everything theres a nice variety of song topics musical styles and instruments fun for the whole family|1
yes you heard me a one for many this is the great lost pink floyd album the one people rarely think about but the one that proves to be quite a rewarding listen when you actually discover it nope no such great wonder for me what happened here is that roger was totally and absolutely tired of the band so that the title even sports the subscription by roger waters performed by pink floyd and it definetly shows there are no contributions from nick or david save from some guitar solos that actually sound out of place and the sound is generally the same slow boring guitar strumming that all of a sudden gets loud with an orchestra and band banging out power chords roger screaming the lyrics at the top of his lungs then back to barely audible repeat for 50 minutes there is not even a single truly creative melody on the whole album roger mostly sticks to rudimentary piano chords or simplistic guitar lines that are so much in the background the voice on the other side is mixed extremely high that for the most part you dont notice them at all  and since there are no breaks between songs i sometimes cant even grab the moment when one song becomes another what happened wheres the clever and attentiongrabbing melodies that roger created on the wall the lyrics on the other hand are quite good this is yet another concept album here roger dedicates the album to the post war dream making the falklands war between britain and argentina a pretext for showcasing his views on the general problem of war and peace the main idea is simple the postworld war two peace ideals have been betrayed the war itself was fought for nothing and the world is still ruled by maggie thatcher brezhnev and begin who dont value human life at all great concept bad execution roger is not that good of a singer anymore with this one he lacked the aggression and resonance that he had nearly spent on the wall and on this he tries too hard to hit some notes which he just cant sing anymore only a diehard waters fan should pick this one up or someone who wants to hear every david gilmour solo avoid at all costs|0
i felt it necessary to share with everyone who considers buying this cd if you actually listen to lyrics and get into the music this will not be a waste of your money these songs are wellwritten effectively delivered and emotionstirringive saw this band live 3 times now and theyve never disappointed me lacey is so animated as are the 3 guitarists so they deliver a highenergy audiencegeared show they have very good stage presence and lacey has excellent crowd connectivity with lots of eye contact and dialogue between songsthis cd will not disappoint you and if you ever get the chance to see them live do it  thank you for reading this  lt3|1
i think that songs 1 and 3 the only ones that are good  the lack for more stars is partially for his material but mostly on this album he sounds like he is singing out of his nose he made a major improvements in his voice  on his later albums|0
this meditation cd is what every christian needs to relax and let go as they fully connect to the presence of god  rhondas soothing voice brings deep relaxation to the mind body and spirit listen over and over again and feel yourself becoming calmer and more centered in gods worda moment of peace relaxation for parents audiobooka moment of peace relaxation for children|1
fabulous video of rush live in concert in dallasvideo is fantastic but sound could be betterhave to really crank the volume upbut it needs to be rememberedthis is a live recording |1
ive been looking everywhere for this cd i bought it a couple years ago but lost it now im happy i found it again really good album|1
i normally try to avoid the trap so many people fall into concerning their music of choice  it seems far too many people seem to lose interest in music or their favorite bands once they the listeners have reached their early 20s or so  at this point as in the case of a lot of my friends and coworkers any music past this point is suspect and they lay back and stay safely in their comfort zones where there is no scary music to have to listen to that they havent already heard a million times  even when they claim classic bands like rush zztop kiss or whomever as their favorites they still wont listen to anything new or buy those groups new albumsi have not suffered that fate and as a musician myself i refuse to  i go nuts if i dont have new music mixed in with my older classic stuff  rock is an evolving art form and people who grow stale totally miss its overall point  rush is a band that has always been musically challenging  they always stayed on the heavier end of progressive music in the 1970s which meant i liked them because even today bands like yes elp and genesis bore me to death  i dont care for much modern prog either because its too much noodling and endless showing off and not near enough song  as rush grew though they wisely adapted to the musical climate without sacrificing their identity which is amazing when you compare caress of steel with the synthesizer heavy music of signals  i must admit some of their latter day stuff has not caught my attention and there have been some cds that i didnt care for such as roll the boneshowever i felt like giving the guys a chance after reading some encouraging stuff about clockwork angels and was pleasantly surprised  its probably the heaviest thing theyve done since permanent waves but doesnt sound like that album  here the star is the song and a great production that makes them sound more full than ever before  alex lifeson seems more interested in textural solos this time and impressive washes of sound that are lush and crushing sometimes all at once  geddy lee shows the bass world once again whos boss with his bass prominent lower toned and all over the place  he hasnt sounded this assertive since the days of yyz  neil peart has not lost power over time either and contributes his usual conceptual storyline which is a meh to me because i dont pay much attention to lyrics anyway unless its somebody unusual like clutchs neal fallonclockwork angels is a work that will grow with time and is strong enough to join their classics like moving pictures if fm radio will pull their heads out of their ass and play something new once in a while  the most interesting and quite beautiful track is the closer the garden with rich acoustics some keyboards and a very nice vocal melody from lee  rush has not really recorded a tune quite like this and it shows them in a songwriting class of their own  long time rush fans should not fear to check out the new album  its pretty impressive|1
amazing vocals on traditional and contemporary celtic songs voice is paired with a cello and violin very effective and lovely|1
i became a fan in the summer of 79 they were my favorite band for over 20 years and are still at 2 love me some spocks beard i havent loved every song theyve done some albums still resonate more than others thats just my personal taste but i have really dug at least something from every period and thats why i love this cd so much there are songs  parts of songs that recall just about every style of writing theyve ever done and plenty of new territory as well track 1 would be right at home on counterparts or test for echo track 2 alternates heavy counterparts with grace under pressure territory track 3 the title track feels to me like their most epic rocker since hemispheres track 4 recalls presto track 5 starts as some of their heaviest stuff ever  then goes into something reminiscent of power windows then back  forth then theres track 6 the halo effect in which rush nails the power ballad to the wall my only wish is this one was longer but i can always hit repeat track 7 is back to the heavier side of counterparts track 8 in parts feels like roll the bones and also a little presto track 9 headlong flight takes me back to my senior year of high school and signals track 10 is basically 127 worth of geddy with a string section nice track 11 goes back to roll the bones and then the final track is so beautiful a memorable vocal hook sung beautifully beautiful arpeggios from alex  geddy and the string section theres 3 or 4 riffs intentional or not i dont care either way cause theyre awesome that directly reference other rush songs like the intro to headlong flight that definitely recalls the intro to bastille day the playing is as good as anything theyeve ever done sometimes i underestimate alexs contributions because his sounds are often so thick  layered and usually a little unconventional but i really really dig what im hearing from him here neil sounds incredibly incredibly loose and there are places that contain some of geddys most agressive playing ever im not throwing myself up as an expert but ive learned several of his lines over the years and theres more than a couple of places here where he sounds so powerful but still in total control and a big tip to the coproducer nick r and the engineers wide powerful and clear theres at least four tracks on here ill be listening to for the rest of my life just like i do with 2112 xanadu la villa strangiato natural science  the camera eye losing it between the wheels emotion detector turn the page hand over fist bravado double agent driven and many many more peace2 weeks later i cant stop listening ive tried twice to listen to something else but i really just wanted to listen to clockwork angels again at home in the car at the office all clockwork angels  all the time just like the good old days would have been if mp3 players had existed i know this is just my opinion there are many other reviews that love it that have wildly different interpretations than mine i read them and think it doesnt sound anything like that to me but its all good and them some i havent dug this deep into a rush album since roll the bones i havent dug this deep into any album since 05 with porcupine trees deadwing thats how much this record means to me going down as one of my alltime favorites again peace|1
my personal favorite album is wish you were here in which the album is a tribute to the bands original front man syd barret unfortunately syd went a little crazy with some acid and mental problems he left the band after 1968 the last album he was with floyd with was piper at the gates of dawn which another reviewer missed wrote and said that roger waters was the front man for that album as a matter of fact he wasnt in the band as a close personal friend of syd he took over for him when he refused to show up and created epics with syd in his head both dark side and wish you were here are greatly influenced by the bands dismay over syd barret the wall is a separate entity from both of those great record the wall shows the absence of the friends feelings for the destruction of there friends life the wall is an album you dont find many of them any where and i believe this is prog rock at its very best and the last glimmer at its greatness i consider floyd among the very best bands ever and the three albums i discussed all show something a little different about emotion and feeling but the wall is what made me fall in love with pink floyd in the first place especially disk two try it out|1
for one of the best albums the beatles made the vinyl was below quality of an original vinyl album  i would have preferred a better quality product and would have been happy to pay more for it|0
as a classical guitarist myself i can appreciate the technical aptitude of fabio zanon on this cd however it is his musical integrity that i call into question here  my primary example is etude 11  fabio not only changes the score but inserts new parts of his own volition  does mr zanon think he is a better composer than villalobos a better musician or a more musically astute person i find his grotesque mutations of a beautiful piece repugnant to the extent of musically criminal  if you like hearing fabio zanon desecrate villalobos original works then this is the cd for you  if you prefer villalobos in his pure and original state then i suggest you look elsewhere|0
this review has been way overdue on my part  finally at 34000 ft from london to la i am able to put this outif anyone remotely knows my musical tastes of recent you know i have been repeatedly listening to heavy metal stuff for the past 24 months life happens i suppose and manifestations of newer tastes takes over the human condition musical tastes too move onwardsi have picked up slashs solo albums since the snake pit and of course the velvet revolver fiasco in my circles a heated debate always brews about the best guitarist etc i am sure any avid rock listener has experienced this  clapton van hailen stevie ray v steve via  the edge page and countless others lead the debatesthis much i do recall at one point in one of these rock brothel debates someone uttered  slash is not in this group he is a best sidelines at best of course i was appalled and got into a fiery fist of words on thisi am not looking for street crud either while listening to all his albums since gnr i noticed something amazing with slash he really carries himself in that guitarist mentality mantra and thrives at it the proof is in the rock n roll pudding  i want anyone to nominate anyone else besides sir clapton  forward whom successfully had immersed himself with other grade a artists and made amazing projectsslash brings a certain style of humility and creativity all in one i absolutely see his work as being a collective of many directions yet again i must emphasize the basic core from which he has grown he gracefully has written his material and went to all the artists and not the other way around that takes humility and a certain fineness to showcase when playing with ozzy or lemmy and the countless othersand the best part is when he plays his material alongside with these artists you can still hear remnants of the guest artist in slashs guitar playing if thats not artistic growth then i dont know what isbut enough goofing off and let me congratulate him on his latest project with sir kennedy in one word from my ears  mothereffen remarkablesound  i am not sure what the boys are cooking behind the mixing board but this stuff on mp3 and cd just sounds infreaking believable kudos on soundsongs  each song written on this album with the solid collaboration with a hand picked band is just riveting and heartfeltsolo style  can one spell solo without slash he and the guys i guess on the album gave him the space to have that slash edge even in between verses and strange places  simply hair raising and ear popping guitar blissalbum art  i am like a kid again with this art i want giant posters of it everywhere in my life  car walls iphones and ipads  best ever album cover i truly enjoyed immersing increative freedomthis part is my favorite  so he goes all out on this album it just sounds like he brought it all around without ever really looking back at anything he has done previously total slashguitarband matesfull throttle creativitythis album has just been non stop pumping for me on all levels bravo chaps bravoooooooo|1
this is the best that pink floyd  did in all their years togeather this is the real thing |1
mp3 download is lacking the hidden trackeverybody always will compare a release to a previous one or group vh in this case this release has got a little different vibe than the first the players here are all heavy hitters everyone is doing their job very well while i like the more kick you in the face party anthems which their first release contained quite a few this one not so much thats ok though there are 3 slower s on here that are greatthe other tracks are good but not over the top joes playing is stellar and his solos are just awsome he is not overplaying which is good sammys voice sounds strong michaels bass and backing vocals are all where they should be will ferrell is a geat drummer as well i mean chad smiththeir songs have alot more hooks in them than lets say black country communion which by the way is a group that i think should just be blazing some trails but seem to fall short all in all it is some good listening just slightly different from the first|1
one of my favorite pink floyd albums of all time the album still holds up even thirty years after the original release if you consider yourself a floyd fan you should own this record|1
i did not hear it yet i ordered it only a few minutes ago i am trying to change this order but for some reason i cannt i keep getting a run around i wanted o get a better grade of the album i ordered and also tried to combine the two orders this is my first try at ordering onthe internet and  this was a bad expierencenever again  good bye mrorsino|0
this is handsdown the best rush album in quite some time ca contains all of the elements that die hards like me love about the band seven cities and the title track are probably my favorites but headlong flight is also high on the list id be even more infatuated with the album had i not listened to the first two tracks 100 or more times in the last two years|1
lets be honest youre either a fan of geddy lee or you cant stand his voice  there really isnt any middle ground here  while i love snakes  arrows and think its one of their best albums clockwork angels has a lot to live up to  after repeated listens of sa that album just got better and better and even though ive heard caravan and bu2b numerous times and in concert this album will undoubtedly get better and better as i listen to it each time  for now a five star album and that isnt because ive listened to rush since the beginning  this is a great album all around  while some fans want rush to keep delivering tom sawyer and the spirit of radio the band has learned to evolve with time and age  geddy leefor me sounds better today than he did in his early years and while it may be that the guys dont pump out an album every year or two they still deliver when they do  im more than thrilled to hear 66 minutes worth of new music from the band  and while they might not have delivered the epic song on this album combine clockwork angels the anarchist carnies and halo effect and you just might have your epic song clocking in at 22 minutes  one reviewer trash review compared geddy lee to elton john as time has marched on  so off the mark that its laughable  has anyone heard elton john sing lately maybe geddy lee has lost his shrieking or the high end but his voice still remains intact and he doesnt need a host of back up singers to sing on any of rush songs  overall for any rush fan this is an instant classic  great job guys and looking forward to seeing you live in the fallon a side note to all the fans who have posted the one star reviews  i must be listening to an entire different album than you i listened to it again today on earbuds on my ipod and am thoroughly enjoying this album  i just dont understand whats not to like on this release  as far as geddys voice i guess im missing where hes singing horribly because i just listen to headlong flight and his vocals say it all there especially near the close  if he couldnt sing he sure couldnt do that  but once again i guess the one star reviewers just want another repeat of tom sawyer or close to the heart or the spirit of radio  time to get out of the past  if you cant then just listen to those albums over and over and over and over and over again|1
liked sammys work with van halen and selectively his solo stuff love most everything satriani has put out feel indifferent about the other two band members liked 34 tracks off the first chickenfoot album to keep me interested and they still make it into my workout set list every once in a while my kid gloves off review of this album is not too kind i dont hear growth so much as regression the best two tracks on the album are different devil and up next everything else is throw away different devil is good but it sounds like something off a hagar solo record up next is the only song that reminds me the guitarist behind this album is one of the best alive only problem with up next is that i really dont want to hear hagars vocals on this one because the lyrics just disappoint compared to that great guitar workoh well maybe the next one will be better|0
ok well i would like to say this  joel shumchis such an shmuck for many reasons  one tim burton was doing great for the first two movies and he went and took over and really messed it up two hes ok but not with style i mean look on how he made the villans and the heros they look like anatomically incorrect barbie and ken dolls plus they were way over done to my thought on this matter  now the soundtrack is something im trying to not get all wound up on  i mean they have no point in the film most dont  im a big smashing pumpkins fan  always have been for years and thought of their song the end is the beginning is the end was to my thought sensational and fantastic im not a big jewel  goo goo dolls fan and lord knows i dispise r kelly i dont care if he believes he can fly i can care less about gotham city too they should of let the smashing pumpkins take over the whole soundtrack  im also upset for the fact danny elfman wasnt doing the score lets face it  people that other guy elliot goldenthal took the base paln of the sound of the movie i wish tim burton directed the last ones bc he can do a better job and so can danny  the soundtrack was bad other than smashing pumpkinss songs they will always rise above to me|0
this is my favorite pink floyd album by far most people name dark side of the moon as the best pink floyd album but i strongly prefer this onethis album is an incredible recording of a band which is at its  absolute peak in terms of musical perfection  there dont seem to be any  moments in this ambitious album where the wrong choice was made  in regard to a note a choice of instrument etc  absolute melancholy  bliss|1
elisa from italy is absolutely rightwell the present generation may not be able to listen the golden oldies and the grand masters in person but it is still true that the past masters far surpassed the new de stefano had a magnetic voice but listen to gigli singing puccinis la boheme and you will melt away though it is v v v difficult to get hold of his mono recordings even in cd i disagree with elisa only on one point tebaldi is good but victoria de los angeles mimi is better and the indulgent thomas beecham is my favourite conductor of this opera way ahead of toscannini but de stefanos boheme is worth keeping and listening to again and again|0
like the reviewer above me the album has skips in iteven tried cleaning it  i purchased it brand new and sealed from a local record store  the skips are huge enough to annoy the freakin hell out of you  it totally ruins the experience of such a great album that it is i recommend buying the original press if possible|0
what more can i say its rushclassic rock updated with a string ensemble on some tracks geddy lee has a smoother vocal sound on this album and he also sounded smoother at a recent concert i attended another musthave for the rush fan|1
i have had this cd for over a month now and it still hasnt got old no bad songs on it if you like load music with base then this is a good cd with flyleaves russian background they were able to make their first cd unique and i think that is what gives her the edge over many other bands the thing i like is flyleafs voice i have nevr heard anything like it before she can go from screaming to a wonderful singing voice all in the same song great cd highly recommend you buy it|1
when i stumbled upon flyleaf i was listening to 943 kilo and the band snagged my love instantly just after hearing the song i went out to find the cd because it was well worth the money and time this band is great especially in the lyrics category of meaningful|1
ok i dont understand how this hasnt come up yet as a child this never caught my attention but i suppose those were simpler times when child abuse was probably much more common and less of a deal than it is today david seville the only human voice on the album is a ruthless heartless psychotic bipolar whipcrackin grinch start your journey into his deranged mind by checking out track 19 wonderful day hear for yourself how he seems to be a perfectly calm collected man of the holiday seasons one moment and a crazed frothatthemouth madman the next as he screams at alvin to fall in line put down his harmonica which alvin bought with his own hardearned money and sing with the rest of his indentured rodent servants seriously this is a very very angry man whose behavior should not be witnessedmuch less celebratedby young impressionable children david seville is actually the stage name of one ross bagdasarian who died in 1972 of a sudden heart attack at the age of 53 i doubt anyone who listens through this album will find this surprising in the least what more can i say my children will never ever hear this abomination of a christmas album just as they will never watch a minstrel show nor a roger moore bond movie with him manhandling and victimizing all women within arms reach until they are old enough to drink smoke and harm themselves in other voluntary ways if you truly want peace on earth this holiday season stay far far away from this record|0
yes the music is a bit cheesy but kids like that sort of thing they enjoy it and it helps reinforce their math facts so i have no complaints|1
mu friend loved the book that i got him for his birthday  great book for all elementary educators|1

i was super pleased the the remastering job done on this classic  i have played it a number of times since recently receiving the order  if you havent replaced vinyl or original cd set with this one i highly suggest that you do  it is seamlessly clean and crispyou cant do without it if youre a pink floyd fanor even if youre not that much of a fansuper |1
id just like to point out to  alan caylow great review totally wrong information regarding the story behind the making of the epic albumfilm pink floyds the wallit is actually loosely based on the life of syd barrett  cofounder of pink floyd and the original front man of the group syd real name roger barrett was the man who turned pink floyd into one of the greatest bands and the sudden death of his father when barrett was 11 is believed to have been at least partly responsible for triggering the mental problems that plagued him as an adultin 1965 he introduced a different flair for musical innovation and the name pink floyd to a group who had mainly been playing covers of rhythm  blues songsunder barretts influence pink floyd began to experiment with a jazzbased psychedelic sound he used low tech techniques like sliding a cigarette lighter up and down his guitars fret board to give pink floyd a distinctive sound different from any other bandsas the bands success grew with its first two albums so did barretts erratic behaviour he would wander aimlessly around the stage during live performances or play just one chord throughout an entire concert heavy use of drugs especially lsd made his mental instability even worsebarrett leftgot sacked from pink floyd in 1968 just three years after cofounding it and he left the music business altogether living the rest of his life in near seclusion in his boyhood home in cambridge spending his time painting gardening and avoiding the public eyepink floyds 1975 album wish you were here was written and released as a tribute to barrettthis is actually a wellknown fact and when i read the review i just had to write my own to set the record straightthe wall is an amazing album and a brilliant film but you must understand what is going on or you would be completely baffledit is not about education systems nazi germany or even roger waters spitting on a fan it is an insight into the mind of a man who was extremely talented yet on the brink of madness and i think it was a mixture of these and also the amount of drugs available at the time that sent poor syd over the edgeroger barrett syd died in july 2006 at the age of 60 of complications caused by diabetes|1
no matter how iommi tried he destroyed sabbath forever insisting in this horrible albuns changing lineups all the time making a joke of sabbath he ceded under the pressure from the recording companies to continue using sabbaths name instead of creating a new band or a solo project he even hired this singer  tony martin  who tries desperately to sound like dio this is a totally forgetable album by  this band  which is not i repeat its not black sabbath|0
titanic has a vaguely movin theme played some many times i want to murder celine dion horner overuses overuses and hmmmmm overuses some more the moronic theme  dont get me wrong i love horners other scores but this  one isnt worth my fat buttplease excuse me but i believe that statement  to be true not even worth getting this for free  stay away from  titanic what in gods name was the academy thinking win they gave horner  the oscar if i ever hear the totally buttholed songmy heart will go  on my heart wont go on anymore|0
i got this 2 cd set thinking yes good luau music wellif youre into the more touristy luau experience of listening to what i feel is a bad rendition of aloha oe or how about when my wahine does the poi sure a kitchy little song but not exactly what i was going for if youre looking for authentic hawaiian music turn to the local music masters like kealii reichel bruddah iz sudden rush for a unique hawaiian rap sound or maybe a complilation cd like island roots 1 2 or 3|0
let me just say that i had no expectations what so ever so i was shockingly happy with the albumrush has been my favorite band for over 20 years and hearing this album makes me happy to be involved in such a band and proud to be a fanwe all have heard caravan bu2b headlong flight they gave us a glimpse of what is coming and here it cameclockwork angels song starts off slowly then kicks off with a strong heavy riff and a great solo performanceanarchist is a song youd never expect to hear in the 2012 year it is strong and the drums and the bass guitar makes heavy combination after each riff my first favoritei can tell you all about the album but truly you have to hear it for yourself its one of the best albums i have heard so far and every listen it grows even morei want to add that the garden is an inspiring song that was made to last and to be a rush classic geddys vocals remind me of days of fly by nights rivendel|1
this cd is wonderful the music is great and the words of every song are fantastic i really enjoy listening to the artist with his upbeat music i could listen to this cd all day without getting tired of it because it makes you feel so good with the way he puts his all into a songi would recommend any cd by this artist and i know youd feel the same way after hearing his voicekaren|1
this is absolutely the best christmas music we have in our extensive collection  we have worn out the tapes need to buy the cd and never tire of it  it is great to listen to the soft sounds of harp playing some of the best christmas melodies ever written while decorating the tree or wrapping gifts  it makes me feel connected to my ancestors while i continue traditions that for me have never lost meaning  this and her sequel album are definitely high on my list of my favorite things about christmas|1
that a band can stay together for 37 years starting from fly by night their first with this line up is amazingthe fact that they can still put out a decent album of new material is astoundingthe fact that their following wants to hear new material rather than a greatesthits set is beyond astoundingthe fact that they can put out an album this good so late on in their careers well thats just not fairwhile tired old greatesthits bands like def leppard zz top go top up their bank accounts with jukebox like short sets every summer these guys are still playing vital new material in 3 hour showsthis is a prime example of why the album is still the best format for music listeningput away your ipads ipods and laptops stop texting for a few minutes guaranteed there will be nothing urgent to respond toget the lyric sheet out put the cd into your music system or preferably put the record on your turntable and crank itread the lyrics dont multitask and rediscover or for the younger crowd discover for the first time what its like to listen to an album oldschool style|1
what in the worldperhaps somebody from delta got the bright idea of using a cellphone to secretly capture these live operatic excerpts and not from the orchestra seats either this guy had to be way up in the last row of the third balconyluciano pavarotti only recorded in the hifi music era yet these cuts almost sound as tinny as enrico caruso acoustic cylinders the only thing missing here is the surface noise come to think of it that might have been an improvementwhen it comes to pavarotti  live on stage the fat lady sang long before the fat man ever did  a real stinker|0
i normally dont buy albums but this one is definilty worth it the acoustic versions are awsome too|1
the greatest waters momment he had to make this album here unlikely animals none could give relevant contributions but when gilmour contributes things make better check out confortably  numb run like hell and young lust  gilmourwaters compositions and goodbye blue sky waters  but sung by gilmour my only complain is why wright an excellent  musician was fired waters you didnt need to do it|1
im a rush fan going back to the 70s  this cd reignited my passion for this band and i cant wait for the blu ray of the concert tour|1
im happy with this cd i love african music specially drumms and this is good thank yuo|1
and every career must have a nadirin sabbaths defense the late 80s were not the greatest period for hard rockheavy metal  on one side were the glam bands poison warrant etc and on the other were the thrashspeed metal bands testament metallica etc  so there really wasnt much of a niche for black sabbath in 1989the personnel on this albumtony iommi  guitars of courselawrence cottle  bass whogeoff nichols  keyboardscozy powell  drumstony martin  vocalscozy powell performs brilliantly on this album  unfortunately the drums are washed out with reverb  the bass is mixed somewhat low so cottle may very well be a virtuoso who can tell  geoff nichols does a great job of making the album sound modern  which now dates the album pretty seriouslytony martin  hes got a great voice  range  power  consistency  so whats wrong  he doesnt have as much vocal personality as either ozzy or dioit goes without saying that tony iommi plays fantastically on the album even though the riffs are fairly pedestrian for a sabbath album  it sounds like hes updated his style even using fingertapping for the devil and daughter solo for some reasongates of hell starts it all off which is essentially a bunch of spooky keyboard noises leading straight intothe headless cross  supposedly theres a story about a bolt of lightning hitting a cross and destroying it and the entire neighboring village died whatever  you cant tell from the lyrics  the riffs arent very exciting and martin shrieking the heeaaadless cross makes your hair stand on end though not in the way it was intendeddevil and daughter uses the old children of the grave gallop but this horse isnt really going anywherewhen death calls  gets off to a pretty start interesting textures but then it gets overblown and anthemic  brian may adds a solo but its difficult to tellkill in the spirit world starts off like somewhat typical 1989 arena metal with a noncharismatic singer  the chorus has a decently complex iommi riff but essentially this song comes and goes without leaving much of an impressioncall of the wild alternates between sparse verses and an exotic snakecharming nicholsiommi riff that is kind of cool but not very engagingblack moon shows promise at the very beginning with a heavy blues iommi riff then in comes the organ and martin talking about oh the devil ugh  like most of these songs the solo is great  but so whatnightwing gets off to a pretty start with some gentle arpeggios and tasteful organ  martin is much better suited to this style than the heavier material  some of the riffs are decent  when the ballad is the best song on a sabbath album this is a problemits hard to tell exactly what went wrong as this is sandwiched between two decent albums eternal idol tyr  maybe its because ray gillen wrote the lyricsvocal melodies for eternal idol and by tyr the band had gelled more  maybe the record company was like okay you need more songs where the guitar completely drops out for the verses and more songs where you say satan to appeal to your fan base  maybe they just needed to put out an album so they could tour and fans would sit restlessly through the new material waiting for war pigswhatever reason every band has to have a worst albumthis is sabbaths|0
the samples shown here for this cd are very unfortunatly not the songs on the cd i am not sure why they have these samples listed when thsy were not actually on the cd|0
i ordered this greatly looking forward to the recording which i have heard before and it is gorgeous no problems there but was sent the wrong cd not cool|0
cd came without bookletliner notes  basically rending the product virtually useless charged way too much for it in this condition  bogus  caveat emptor|0
several baroque violinists have recorded bachs six solos including sigiswald kuijken rachel podger lucy van dael and most recently john holloway  elizabeth wallfisch chose to record her version at pitch a400 a whole step lower than modern concert pitch which the liner notes inexplicably describe as general practice in early eighteenthcentury germany this despite what i was taught that chamber pitch in bachs milieu was a415  but the problems go beyond bending your ears to listening to bach at an unfamiliar pitch  the sound that comes from elizabeth wallfischs violin here is strident scrapy and abrasive and after a while becomes tiresome to listen to particularly in multiple stops  she assumes certain baroque stylistic mannerisms in a way that seems affected rather than heartfelt as for example the unwarranted doubledotting in the adagio of the c major sonata  this rendition feels predominantly dark gloomy and unrelieved and gives off little joy  this cd has been discontinued probably for good reason  go with podger holloway or kuijken|0
ive been trying to get a copy of this cd for last 3 weeks  although the cd jacket is correct when opened the cd inside is of mozarts clarinet concerto  this has happened 3 times even after being assured by amazons customer service that the error will be corrected if you order it and succeed write a review and i will try again7172013|0
unless youre a huge carpenters fan you will not like this elaborate and lengthy cd very much  i ended up deleting most songs from my amazon cloud player and keeping only 2 or 3 from this double album|0
i must not have read the description very well  there was no singing by karen carpenter  big disappointmentwill pay better attention next time|0
this deutsche grammophon cd is noteworthy for featuring the worldpremiere recording of olivier messiaens final work and its filled out by some early and relatively unknown works myungwhun chung conducts the orchestre de lopera bastillethe concert a quatre for piano cello oboe and flute wasnt actually the last thing that messiaen worked on after completing two movements he set it aside when he took on the commission for his massive eclairs sur laudela however this quadruple concert was completed after his death by his widow yvonne loriod together with the composers george benjamin and heinz holliger they orchestrated the second half of the second movement while apparently they wrote the entire fourth movement on the basis of messiaens plans using scraps from earlier works to do so loriod and holliger perform on piano and oboe with mstislav rostrpovich and catherine cantin on cello and flute respectivelyif youre familiar with messiaens career then you probably know what to expect here the utterly gratuitous use of birdsong just like nearly every other work from his last four decades but without the epic vision of the best of these messiaen had some inspiration from the classical era in writing this piece namely the example of mozart which results in a curious restraint ultimately its a very lightweight piececompleting and recording this concerto certainly seemed worthwhile in the immediate aftermath of messiaens death when his pupils wished to pay a tribute to the dead master and audiences could be attracted by a last work however almost no interest has been shown in this concerto since even as other messiaen is recorded repeatedly so that ought to tell you how insignificant it isun sourire for orchestra 1989 is another generally forgettable late work 10 minutes of birdsong and nothing else though the last minute or so is eeriethe remaining two pieces come from a very different composer a young student of his french forebears who wouldnt yet discover birdsong for decades les offrandes oubliees 1930 and le tombeau replendissant 1931 are among messiaens earliest pieces and while the example of debussy can be heard occasionally theres considerable violence that surely didnt come from that impressionist composer and theres already messiaens original long drawnout lines like some vision of heavenly peace these two early works are juvenalia but they are nonetheless more meaty and entertaining than the elderly composerall in all id recommend this disc only to messiaen completists the pieces are minor plus ive never really cared for myungwhun chungs messiaen interpretations which tend to be flimsy and nebulous|0
the 10th anniversary inconcert recording of this amazing show is much better  it is called the dream cast for a reasonles mis is my favorite show of all time and i have 4 different recordings of it  the 10th anniversary cast is by far the best and this one is by far the worstterrence mann is wonderful but certainly not better than philip quast who plays javert in the 10th anniversary  the eponine on the broadway recording is terrible  so if you want to hear on my own or a little fall of rain performed with any beauty or integrity dont buy this versionthe 10th anniversary cast has more of the music almost the entire show every single performer is a standout and fabulous if you are a true fan of this show or want to become one buy that recording instead  please|0
terrific pictures really show how hot the glam scene was in la in the 80s  if you are an 80s rocknroll fan you do not want to miss this book|1
this is the best rush album since what signals maybe every track is good and i love the steampunk concept|1
ive been listening to etienne daho since high school i lived in france for 10 years and can easily remember when tombe pour la france was a big hit over there this cd really is quite uninspiring all the tracks pretty  much sound alike and his musical talents are definately not put to the  testif youre interested in french music pick up one of his best  cds pour nos vies martiennes which has tons of beautiful songs and  exceptional lyrics for those of you know french the track des ir will  definately appeal to your more poetic sideeden lacks in character  but etienne is definately a good source for french pop his latest  release is just uninspired|0
you might think that you are getting your favorite beatles songs here but beware that most of them actually are rehearsal versions different takes some of them partial there are several different takes of the same song here and there and sadly some of the most popular songs original versions are missing again replaced by annoying rehearsal versions you are much better of buying separate albums than collecting this hodgepodge of takes|0
while this album isnt quite as good as some of pink floyds other recordings such as meddle dark side of the moon wish you were here or animals it is still a wonderful album that tells a great story first of all this is a concept album it tells the story of pink a guy who has been driven to madness by the world and his own personal demons roger waters lyrics are in top form here as usual and he describes the human experience with amazing accuracy this album tells of problems with depression society friends family drugs and about every other topic that everyone goes through during their life that is why this album is so great the wall is meant to be listened to in its entirety like most of pink floyds albums as it flows from one song to another adding to the story with each note and lyric songs like another brick in the wall goodbye blue sky young lust hey you comfortably numb run like hell the thin ice and nobody home are the most notable standouts on this album but the other songs are great too and besides even if the song doesnt have really good music to it it will always have great lyrics the 3rd bestselling album of all time no surprise|1
so youve heard about the great acid rock band pink floyd and decided to give them a whirl  among the selection you would probably see would be animals atom heart mother wish you were here delicate sound of thunder  dsotm and the wall  you know another brick in the wall prt  2 so you go with thatnow wether you like the album or not is  debatable  my musical taste and being the person i am i find the album  very intriguing  but lets face it it is not for everybody  it is a  confusing album and a confusing movie  yes they did make a movie of  this  basically it is a long music video the story is not as hard to  follow as everyone makes out  at least the general gest of it isnt hard  to find  its obvious that a rock star named pink floyd build a  psychological wall separating himself from pain but also love  then  being jealous he starts almost a neonazi work a group killing the  queers jews coons and the reds  it details the hitler  devices of ovens and gas chambers  even mentions polka dot ones  from my  perspective it is a fascinating venture tho rather obscure at times  into a narrative poem telling an epic story  the main problem yes there  are problems with this is the fact that although it is not as notoriously  hard to follow it is rather sketchy in places  my suggestion is if you  want some interpretations go in the internet and try to find some ive  found severalmusically  interesting usually  sometimes it is nothing  save snippets of music to advance the rather sketchy plot this is not an  album you just play part of if you want a full understanding of the album  that is generally true of any decent album but especially this one and  true concept albums  sorry beatles fan and i am one too sgt pepper  doesnt make concept like this one does  some interesting tunes would be  happy daysbrick in the wall prt ii dont leave me now mother and young  lust  thats disc i  disc ii is anybody out theretrack ii for the  gorgeous acoustic track at the end 6 comfortably numb 9 run like  hell10 waiting for the worms 12 the triallyrically  interesting narrative poem piece  because of the audience it could have  been made more clear but that was waters call and nothing we can do  about itanother danger this album is that if people dont understand  it it is easy to take things out of context  if you now it is a man  losing his sanity behind a mental wall then you understand the slamming of  education and the racial slurs  if you dont then you mihgt think pf is  against education and against the other races  and interesting thing about  another brick in the wall part ii is the fact that theyre  proving a point  we dont need no education is a double  negative  they are showing that despite the cynical view pink has on his  school they do in fact need educationbottom line good album that  tells a story  but be prepared to have to scratch your head a couple of  times and question now why is that song there and what does it  mean|1
since traveling in chile i became a fan of this delightful country i am very interested in their music  this recording restores some historical chilean folk music that is wonderful  however i am very disappointed in  the sound quality  it appears the recording was taken from a worn lp since  i can hear preecho and warble on some of the songs  also there are no  historical liner notes which would have compensated greatly for the poor  sound|0
quite why this score has got so many fans i dont know sure the score works in the film it works almost perfectly which is ultimately the composers goal but as an album this soundtrack is noisey and unpleasent to listen to with the exception of main title desert suiteits over and possibley john and dyson  fieldel has chosen to use synths exclusively here no orchestral touches he has also chosen to use heavy purcusion too and i stress the word heavythe majority of the score lacks melody or a clear path it seems to just crawl along at the same noisy pace and with the exception of the title track doesnt leave anything memorable to the listener having said that the title track and the last track on the album are excellent and thats why i find it such a shame that fiedel had to ruin the rest of the album with a mass of unlistenable action cues he is capeable of producing alot better in my opinion the majority of true score fans will not find this score appealing and unless you are a big fan of the movie itself i would suggest you steer well clear|0
i have been listening to this album for awhile now and it hasnt grown on me at all  sometimes an album is so sublime it takes time to appreciate like presto or voivods angel rat  this is not the case with clockwork angelsi had high hopes for this album since the songs bu2b and caravan which were prereleased are pretty good  headlong flight was released about a month prior to the release and i swore that if the entire album resembled those three tracks it would be another classicturns out those are the only good songs on the album  and for the love of christ dont read the ca book  its even worserush is still the greatest rock band to grace the planet in my opinion and i eagerly await their next effort  i just hope it doesnt sound anything like this garbage|0
this is the only place i know of where i could find the mix of mouth that was released on the radio  thats the only reason that i bought the cd and i have to say that its the only thing on the cd that was able to hold my attention  so im a satisfied customer but if youre not into buying discs for a single track you might stay clear of this one|0
i remember these songs from when i was a child and wanted my son to have the same experiences you cant go wrong with the duck song or the railroad song a must have for every child that loves music and likes to sing|1
i bought this because my hubby heard one of their songs  he thought id enjoy this band boy do i ever enjoy their music i had to listen to the album a few times but im really into it now the female lead vocals are great  the male vocals are blended nicely the sound is varied from more mellow to harder rockeach song is unique the lead vocals go from singing to screaming at times but its all put together so well the musics overundertones  her voice reminds me of several bandsartists such as evanscence crisis scarling veruca salt  some male bands too this album seems to have a lot of influences  would appeal to those who like rock alternative metal even pop my only complaint is that the songs are shorter the album is just over 30 minutes in length i wish they would of lengthened a couple of the songs  put some more on the album overall very entertaining  awesome albumbandi recommend them|1
every time i see his performance on comedy central i laugh 5 times maybe and i am still laughing hysterically his humor is witty yet he doesnt always pick out things like current events i love his poptart bit the things that make him the best are his facial expressions eye movements and the tone of his voice its masterful and its too bad that this cd doesnt show him doing all of that his dvd is coming out soon though so cross your fingers for thatthis cd doesnt have the poptart thoughstill it has alot all his talk about animals is funny especially spider webs the car stuff is funny too blasting zone ahead and seatbelts are 2 of my favorites|1
with the exception of rawhide and ghost riders this album is schmaltzy and dull|0
i wouldnt buy a cd with serious sound issues as more than one reviewer said  also the suite espanola is incomplete and is missing 3 pieces including asturias one of my favorites|0
i read a ton of the reviews and decided to check this cd out at the library to listen to it before buying  i was not one of the nostalgic parents who remembered this from childhood  after listening to it i decided not to buy it  i really did not care for this cd  not only did i feel there was too much talk and not enough music but the talk itself begged questions that probably dont even cross the minds of your average 23 year old such as the girls are just as good as boys theme your girl wont even wonder if shes as good as a boy if you dont make a thing of it and just treat her right  anyway this cd bugged me a lot because of issues like that|0
this album has to be one of his best often i have one or two favorites on an album but every song is so beautiful here it is almost march and i cant stop listening to it i feel so uplifted no matter what so beautiful|1
quadraphenia  sorry guys but there is a lot of similarity between  this good album and the superior quadraphenia from the whothree other  observationsin the flesh  has to be one of the best heavy metal songs  evergilmour is right  vera lynn and bring the boys back home were weak  fillerat least it doesnt have cyndi lauper|1

brian is an outstanding comedian very clean with exception of using the h word occasionally he finds humor in reallife events and experiences the content is funny enough but his presentation adds considerably to the humor|1
i like to singi guess that everyone doesbut most of us are aware of our limitationsand do not impose our singing upon otherspage morton black apparently likes to singbut she ought to consider the rest of us before putting that awful voice on record and expecting others to buy fortunate for the wouldbe buyer that samples of msblacks art can be heard before buyingso that the womans absolute lack of talent can be experienced before any money changes hands|0
never got to listen to it because it can to me in pieces whomever packaged this to send out for deliveryseems to have used the flimsiest protection that they could find i opened the packagepeeled off the plastic from the double cd and it literally and physically fell completely apartin all fairness to the merchant affiliated partner of amazon i have gotten many other things from them in the past with excellent service however on this particular venture someone dropped the ball|0
remember the first time you heard far cry from snakes and arrows you probably thought to yourself i knew they could still bring it unfortunately sa didnt rock but clockwork angels doesfor the reviewers who dont like this sound and are giving the album 1 or 2 stars i have to ask what is wrong with you people weve been waiting for a rush album to sound like clockwork angels for 30 yearssure not every song is a classic but the anarchist and headlong flight are worth the price of this album throw in caravan bu2b carnies halo effect seven cities of gold the wreckers and the unbelievably gorgeous the garden which is arguably the most beautiful song theyve ever recorded and clockwork angels should satisfy lifelong rush fansas another reviewer put it this is a combination of 2112 and test for echo and it is very close to perfection|1
this recording is very bad stay away from it studer is not ment to sing violetta she does not even sound as if she is into the part  pavarotti was ment to sing alfredo just not here he is still one of the best  alfredos around but this recording he sounds bored and not into his  character juan pons is great as germont but just because he is in it its  not worth buying this bad recording the orchestra under james levine  sounds for lack of a better word weird it does not sound full but not  to small  very bad reading of one of the very few verdi operas i like|0
very nice music for practicing my tai chi i downloaded it to my phone so i use headphones and do my practices i also get anxious sometimes when i am shopping or driving and i noticed it really helps to listen if i feel nervous relaxing and explorative at the same time|1
this album is modern driven and deep as prog as needed to make it interesting but never forgetting how to rock it needs more than one listen before you realize depth it shows a vitality bands half their age cant muster highly recommended|1
this album gives me much listening pleasure great hits like goodbye blue sky  another brick in the wall ii comfotably numb all incredible recordings i also suggest watching the movie version of this album a necessity for the classic rock fan|1
i bought this cd for only two records which i had on tape for 30 years  after the 2 songs that i really love the others were very disappointing and the cd was not worth 45ill rate it 2 stars  one for each song|0
i have been a brian regan fan for a long time and i have to say that this is brian at his best he is easily the funniest comic out there and he does it with wit and a clever edge that is missing in most stand up comedy instead of resorting to easy luaghs from sexual escapades and other junk that all comedians seem to be recycling these days brian brings in a new perspective on how stupid we all really are cant wait for another one|1
brian regan is the funniest comedian hands down  i was laughing so hard i was convulsing in my chair and making noises previously limited to the jungle  by the end i felt like id exercised my ab muscles for 30 minutes straight  i highly recommend a good dose of brain regan to cure what ails you|1
hey everyone knows unrated is a joke  9 out of 10 times there are scenes in the film that you would never miss 2 more minutes of nudity maybe a little more blood in scene some junk that hit the cutting room floor even  yet i really enjoy seeing this picture in the form i had it on vhs  nostalgia  maybe  all i know is that this is the 3rd running of this disc and yet this unrated version is nowhere  why  first running was in 2006 and didnt have much in way of extras either  i recommend not buying this if you love to see your movies uncut  too much too often are they putting out a product lesser at an unreasonably high price  i feel that way when it comes to seeing a picture like this come out without the ability to choose the unrated or rated version on the disc  have some passion about your product|0
i was very disappointed in amazon for not having this product for several weeksi ended up canceling the order|0
damn it just buy this now|1
musicianship this album outstrips everything rush has done it is a tourdeforce of heavy yet brilliant wizardrystorytelling while not as groundbreaking ominous and foreboding as 2112 ca is a more complete better developed and ultimately more satisfying story a true concept album that genre was given up for dead decades ago rush has thrown it right back in our faces better than ever ballsyenergy let yourself go with the coldfire steampunk fantasy there is a remarkable depth and force in this recording many reviewers have mentioned that this album just gets better with repeated listenings i completely agree ca is full of riffs thunder and grind interspersed with shimmering textures and surprising even for rush twists and turns it will have you singing to yourself things like i have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels and i wish i could live it all again sure your non rush fan friends  might think youre strange but that to me would be a compliment his mind is not for rentappeal rush fans this is the album weve been waiting for this one was made just for us as they all were but this one feels more so it is awesome that just as rush finally gets inducted into the rr hof instead of pandering to the critics and the unthinking masses these three masters decided to focus even more intently on us their remarkable passionate and dedicated some may rightly say obsessive fan basei enjoyed the novel as well although it is not a 5 star offering ill review it over thereyes the days of soaring artrock tomes like xanadu jacobs ladder and la villa strangiato have passed and i dearly love those and almost all of rushs earlier music but i for one cheer them on into the future this is cause as the story goes for optimism hey i hope tending the garden does not mean laying down the tools|1
i love love love tinas new cdim learning so much about myself with this cd tina empowers you to examine yourself and discover what or how you create your own disease she leads you through self discovery and down the path of selfhealingthis is a very powerful cd i think it is my favorite cd of hers because you can personalize it so easily i like the beginning as she tells her story she lays the foundation for the listener to know that disease can happen to anyone and anyone  just like tina can change that disease very powerfulthank you|1
if youre looking at amazons track list for this cd and the first song is the dusty millercucanandy be aware that you will probably be sent a different irish jigs and reels with the same covercolor scheme but a different set of songs i own the cd with the dusty millercucanandy which i ordered from amazon a few months ago and it is excellent however i recently ordered another copy as a gift and was surprised to see a new set of songs on an otherwise identicallooking cd they sent a replacement and it was still the wrong onei listened to the updated cd and its not nearly as good as the previous one but enjoyable nonetheless it consists of 12 fastpaced reelsjigs and no singing i gave the onestar rating so people can be aware of this discrepancy|0

good but i like yoyo mas soul of the tango more|0
the music documented on this lp has seen better transcriptions see the available remastered cd from blood  fire good transcriptions present the music and the harmonies in a wonderful fashion if you enjoy ska with a rasta flavor then this is one of the best sessionsmixes everhowever this version of those sessions does not do the music justice  the product includes 2 lps i recieved what appeared to be a vp factory sealed product that included one lp the title lp which was scuffed marred with suface scratches and ripped labels on both sides  the second lp was in better shape but hardly what one considers today to be grade b  the sound on each when not interrupted by multiple scratches and surface noise was thin and distant  too bad  the second lp included various tracks from subsequent work by the principals mirroring some of the content on the blood  fire cd  go with the blood  fire it is worth the extra money|0
i work on computers all day long and its been impossible to wind down at night so i can get a good nights sleep my mom went to one of her workshops and suggested i get her cd now instead of sitting in bed on my ipad i pop in her cd into my laptop and clear my mind of the million things that happened during the day ive also done other things like not eating late and making tea to ceremoniously close my day after doing these things and listening to this evening meditation ive been able to break my habit of staying connected to the web right up to bed time its great thank you tildet|1
the wall is the opus of the inventors of three dimentional sound  every previous album starting from the days of syd barrett including dsotm brilliant as they werewas a rehersal for the liquid elegance of this  album  if it was just the music pink floyd is still just a bandone of a  kind butbut theyve also lyricized the stuff for which people have  won nobel prizes in literaturesee free fall by william golding  then listen to the wall and then listen to yourself  there isnt a  song as such in the wall it all hangs together in a wonderful  ecstatically tight and yet melancholly kind of way  and all this is still  alive after twenty years how many albums can boast of that|1
ive been a rush fan for many years and this album  has me stunned that these guys still have plenty of rocket sauce left in them you get a well written and perfectly executed journey from the first track to the last its comparable to 2112 in that it tells a story and  gives you the full range of sound that rush is capable of producing you want be disappointed|1
update nov 2013 below is my initial review and i stand by it now that time has passed and others have chimed in i was curious what those that rated this 1 star had to say and their reasoning other than axl loveloyalty i cant find any qualified reasoning this is not gnr hence why it is titled slash the present gnr is not gnr and if dishonesty is to be cited it should fall upon axl what made afd what it was was slash izzy axl and duff in various but not equal parts i have followed all of the mentioned solo works i would say the balance of izzys more rolling stones and slashs energy is probably the largest contributors to the music axl hired solid musicians to mimic what the band later did on the use your illusion set and from that came chinese democracy i enjoy it but it isnt gnr and if axl had real balls and respect for his fans he would fly under the axl rose banner rather than leach of the guns n roses name axl manipulated the others to sign over their rights to the name and band read the collective biographies which gives him legal right to use gnr but it isnt and never will be without slash duff and izzy i felt the need to point that out to those bashing slash out of misplaced loyalty to axl a fan can appreciate both but if you come to axl slash izzy or duff expecting afd 2 youll be disappointedthis has the edge of the original gnr yet has its own identity as well i loved the 2 slash snakepits then came that abortion group with scott then the first slashwhich i liked but am less a fan of the multiple guest singer deal and now we are here and myles is a perfect fit for this blistering music i defy anyone that loved appetite for destruction not to love im not saying its a clone of that as there will never be another afd from slash izzy what axl calls gnr these days or even if the originals tried im just telling you that vibe is here|1
clockwork angels certainly isnt a perfect album but its awesome anywaythis could be the band at its finest only time will tell|1
listening to this reminds me of how and why i fell in love with reggae so many decades ago what is great is that they still are fresh and lively|1
making an album these days is getting harder and hardereverything has already been doneim amazed at the creative minds of the 3anyone who wants to complain needs a better understanding of music  appreciate the talent that rush hasthis album blows my mindits recorded very wellits very bass heavy so you wont need your subwoofer much typical rushjust give it some time to sink inalex geddy and neil always come up with some good stuffthank you rushill be seeing you guys in seattle in november|1
well honestly i feel that this would have been better if it were just a single of here comes the sun its by far the only song worth having i find it cool that the songs in the middle of the album are connected and lead into each other but there is nothing there worth remembering i totally feel that songs like maxwells silver hammer and octopuss garden can both be added to the list of goofy beatles songs considering the famous album cover which i love to most beatles fans this album should come out as a disapointment|0
the fastest guitarist accolade goes to herman li lee from a power metal band called dragonforce  he makes angelo look average and plays so fast that you will think that there is a fault with your cd player  it is all so boring power for the cause tasteless playing that says so little musically|0
read the fine print before you buy this releasenow if all you wish to hear is the fifth symphony then fine by all means buy the damn thing  if you expect the sixth symphony as well as advertised read the very fine print please  gould recorded just the first movement if that in my humble opinion as it a perfunctory performance at best  by goulds standards it is dreadfully amateurish the fact that he did not record the whole piece is proof enough that he was either not satisfied with his performance im not or he decided against recording it at all which does not and of course not prevent sony from releasing it anyway  as it is the disc is a pathetic 47 minutes running time  it would obviously have been even shorter than that without the first movement of the sixththis release is a total ripoff  no cd can be justified for release with barely 47 minutes of recorded music get the katsaris set instead a great recording of all the symphonies truly superior in terms of sound quality a magnificent performance by a great pianist and for its price terrific value there is another new recording of two of the symphonies by the young alexandre tharaud  but the cd is almost impossible to find these days a genuine rarity|0
really just putting it into words does not do this collection justice  i loved the debut cd but this one blows it out of the water  combining a healthy dose of fun rockers bigfoot alright alright and deeper more series offerings i need a job whos next the cd has a deeper darker feel to it but maintains a healthy fun vibe as wellthe best song on the cd has to me something going on but the hidden track untitled or maybe call it no change is a phenominally powerful offering both musically and lyricall  the opening track last temptation is incredible again both musically and lyrically  lighten up will get your pulse pounding  and come closer is one of the most beautiful and moving songs ive heard in a long long time  really you can listen to this from front to back and theres not a bad song in the entire offeringthanks to sammy joe mike and chad for doing rock the way it should be done|1
i havent enjoyed this one very much  as a matter of fact i passed it on  seemed lackluster somehow|0
yes i have to agree 100 with the other reviewer  never has michael rose put his signature chanting and roots ryhtms into this great a use since the day of early black uhuruif you loved sinsemilla and red days of black uhuru and roses mystic sounds and since that day you wondered what happened  here is your answer with this album and the previous african roots album|1
i bought this album when it first came out  i only listen to it when i have time to listen to the whole thing  its like watching a favorite moviethe sound quality of the instruments and sound effects are amazing  the story is creepy psychotic a bit disturbing at times and just an amazing imaginary masterpiecehighly recommend this if you are going to occasionally listen to the whole thingenjoyjmck|1
i do not own any of the rehashes of the adventures of robind hood soundtrack however i feel with the soundtrack i do own i can say that this soundtrack and any others are terrible compared to what i have im sure theyre okay since i assume they are professionals but the soundtrack im going to tell you about is the best out therethis soundtrack is the complete original and official recording of the adventures of robin hood conducted by the composer erich wolfgang korngold this cd was never intended for a public release but it is now thanks to the guys at tsunami doing their best to convert any old movie soundtracks that were a vinyl recording onto a cd without skimping out on the original sound this soundtrack sounds just as well as you hear it in the movieanyone who is looking for the original soundtrack can find it by searching with the serial number tsunami tsu 0139 expect to look hard for a while and have to deal with foreign money |0
the vendor is delivering a burned on demand facsimile version of the cd poor quality reproduction of the cover photo no liner notes  dont waste your time and money on this one|0
if you are at all into this genra of music this is a must have ive listened to the lyrics of this couple for years now and no where else have i found two people more in tune with what it means to be pagan there songs weave spells king of hearts an invocation to pan are some definate high lights and witchs to the dance are all amazing if you can find this tape buy it you wont regret it|1
bad singers except maybe luna  the worst being manrico bad conductor the only interest  the additional three minutes of the finale more dramaticcette version chanteacutee par de petites pointures qui remplissent agrave peine le contrat a pour seul inteacutert lair final dit  finale franais  bien que traduit en italien plus long de trois minutes que le finale habituel il est plus progressif et donc plus dramatique estce suffisant pour acheter le disque |0
very much like the original album  they clipped a couple tracks at the ends but maybe that was something in the analog to digital conversion  still one of the best albums of its kind|1
the first album without roger waters the backbone of floyd since the glory days of dark side is the first for the new and unimproved pink fraud  david gilmour is a great musician but he couldnt write a decent  lyric to save his life  without waters lyrics to inspire him gilmour and  the rest of the fraud fall flat with this lackluster effort  there are two  good songs count em two learning to fly which would even  make an excellent authentic floyd song and on the turning  away which is kind of weinie but is still pretty good  i have  suspicions that outside man and former cohort of the band that legimately  called themselves pink floyd bob ezrin wrote the lyrics to learning  to fly  there is no way gilmour could have written such wonderful  words  pink frauds first album features such awful tracks as the  dogs of war and a new machine two songs that should have  been titled we need you back roger waters parts 1 and 2  the rest of permanent lapse of good music is utterly forgettable  fortunately i didnt waste any money on this piece of trash  my aunt gave  it to me because she couldnt bare the embarrassment of owning it herself  unfortunately i spent almost an hour listening to it  those who thought  the final cut a weak musical effort will take it back when they hear this  sad attempt to make up for the fact that the real pink floyd is no longer  with us|0
disco scifi they got to be kidding stay away from this mess the 1 star rating is false its the only way i could get this thru its really a big zero|0
pink floyd the wall isnt an album is a part of everyones life touch many aspect of life like isolation alienation sorrow lies broken dreams marriage chilhood selfdestruction etc thats the reason why the wall has been and still is and will be forever the most important piece of music even beyond rock music from all times the most finest concept album ever made by a band or an artist the most powerful lyrics ever written the most extraordinary music for that lyrics etcthe wall is an experience how many albums or artist are really an experience nowadays  u2  they died in 2000 eminem   britney spears  robbie williams this is not an album this is a life experiencei really hope someday will have pink floyd the wall live dvd|1
this is cd is pretty much antigangsta its censored and biggie and pac are only on 1 track which is be the realistthe rest is all a rapper named trapp chocolate chip trey and southside clikthis cd is pretty much all about stopping the killing over stupid stuff like colors and bs like he said she said stuff they put the message in hip hop beats which most are west coast style the title track stop the gunfight has remnants of biggie and pac mixed into the song like biggie saying i grew up a fkn screw up got introduced to the game and fkn blew up lt that sample is mixed in then the rapper trapp gets on there and sings theres an rb version of the same song on the cd toothe only other song besides be the realist really worth a listen is called can i get your number  and it dont have biggie or pac on it just trapp but its a good song probaly the only song that isnt antigangsta its an xxx adult trackif you want some good hip hop w a message than this cd is for you if youre looking for some gangsta thug shiznit youre gonna want to toss this|0
even though he is from holland he sounds like a real latinlover this song is made for a romantic evening with candlelightdinnerjust like the preview single id love you to want me if you like ricky martin or enrique iglesias this is something for you but if not youll probably start screaming by hearing such a schmalzy songthe single includes radio extended and instrumental version|0
okin my own mind i am the biggest rush fan out there just as all of you are in your minds but i want to give my honest critiquei truly believe that some of these songs are brilliant and are the best theyve done in a long time the title track is incredible and sparks many great memories from past rush masterpieces the garden is just absoulutely the most beautiful thing theyve ever done there are other gems on here as wellnow i wasnt a huge fan of vapor trails or snakes and arrows my favorite rush period was from their beginnings up until counterparts i found vt and sna too in your face not enough downtime in the music to allow me to think about and enjoy what i was hearing i didnt find melody and most importantly dynamics in those albums and thought the song structures were just not there on many of the songsnot all of them mind you i think for a majority of clockwork this has much much improved but there are stll songs on clockwork that follow suit of the previous two i have to admit it drives me nuts however with that being saidwhat works here reallllly works there is some classic rush on this album and by that i dont just mean songs that remind me of old songs im talking about songs that make me feel like i remember what a rush song used to make me feel im talking chill inducing excited and maybe a little teary eyed i didnt get any of that from vt and sna so i can take the things im not sure about from clockwork and overlook them because the good of this album is just that goodproduction wise this cd is an absoulute gem musicianship is top notch of course i think its some of geds best bass work in a long timei have yet to really dive into the concept of the album but i will definitely take the time to really sit down and read the lyrics story as i listen to the musickeep in mindthis is just one biggest fans opinionfavorites so far after 24 hours of listeningclockwork angels the verses here with alexs arpeggios are beautifulexactly what id like to see more ofthe anarchist  love the middle eastern feelhalo effect  all around great tunebu2b2  yes its just a short passage but i love it id love to see more of thisthe garden  jus beautifultake my review for what its worthwhich isnt much as we all have different tastes but i felt i needed to write out my thoughts so farandlolmy ultimate final thought on this album i know i sound criticali just really love what i love about rush but the fact that im still buying rush albums the first day they come out just like i have been since the 1980s is not lost on me and for that alone i couldnt be happier and more appreciativethank you from the bottom of my heart geddy alex and neil|1
yo i dont get itwhy does every1 like this cd it is basically horrible the only thing stopping me from givin g it 1 star is winter warz and all that i got is you the rest of it is  horrible the beats are repetative the lyrics dont do anything for me  dont get me wrong wu tang is phat but ghost is lackin on this one it could  have been a lot better maybe supreme climinte will prove  itself to be better|0
what else can be said about this album  i was ten when another brick in the wall hit the charts  this was one of the first albums i ever owned  went through a cassette two copies on vinyl and this was my first cd i purchased in the late 80s when cds hit the market  absorbed the movie the movie box covers became my notebook cover in high school and everything pink floyd i could  it was the defining album of my youth waters capturing that anguish and angst of maturing in a cynical worldi grew out of it over time and it has become something of a memory machine revisiting the past and the intensity of that time as i sought meaning in life  it has no relevance on that level anymorehowever i stumbled across pink floyd under construction which contains  demos of the process by which the wall came to be  apparently waters in the late 70s came to the band with ideas for the wall and what would become the pros and cons of hitchhiking  the band thought the material for the wall had potential and began to build on it though there are traces of the wall material in the hitchhiking album or vice versathough for the most part it is the same album there are some subtle and significant differences in the songs as we know them mostly in the lyricscomfortably numb originally began for gilmours first solo album but made its way into the wall  gilmour brings the melody waters adds the lyrics  however imagine these lyrics in comfortably numbwake up now pull yourself togeatherget out and meet new people screamim sure theyll understandcome on put away the shotgunhere have another blue onescreamhave your fingertips gone numbor these for mothermamas gonna check out all your girlfriends for youmama wont let anyone dirty get throughmamas gonna burn all your pornographyshell watch what you see and watch what you hearits fascinating to listen to these demos after knowing the album so well  its as if im hearing it for the first time and it is mind blowing this time from a more historical archival point of view rather than as music that defines my emotional lifeyoull find the song what shall we do now in the film but not on the album though the lyrics are on the inner sleeve of the original album  the song is on the under construction disc  young lust is just an instrumental  this is a fans dream  its like being there as the creative process unfolds and you can see the roll bob ezrin played in bringing this to its finished form that we all knowhunt down a copy of under construction and really really appreciate just how amazing this album really isyou can also get hints of roger waters taking control of the direction of the sound and how it would culminate with floyd in the final cut the trajectory waters taking climaxing with the pros and cons of hitchhiking also very recommended|1
how appropriate that beds are on the cover as this is the first of pink floyd albums that qualifies as just a collectors item for floyd fanatics and will positively put anyone else and some fanatics like myself to sleep there are so many great floyd albums dont buy this one unless you are curious about the bad floyd album and want to see if it could really be that bad it is not that its terrible but just for floyd it is extremely mediocre|0
well i did not think that these all time classics could get any better david glen hatch proved me wrongevery selection proves to be not only awe inspiring  but also communicative  hatch brings to life the soul of the melodies that have inspired us with his stunning use of  technique however we do not loose sight of  the precious light of  heart warming classics such as beauty and the beasti highly recommend this to all to lovers of music  for this one reason yes its impressive yes its a marvelous  selection of our most prized musical masterpieces but the reason i would would recommend this to all is the fact that every selection says somthing special  to me that can not be expressed in words  helping me lifting me  and that is what makes good music|1
give yomo some money and then kill an icon to get publicity and et is not from another planet but is from a makeup wardrobe setting and they were all actors and none of this is true and i could just go on and on but tonight ive got a headache|0
dont buy this if youre looking for a recording of the music from this operetta  this recording is hideous  i was hoping for a soundtrack but this is a childrens retelling of the storyand they couldnt even get that right with poor recordings of some of the songs  i was terribly disappointed|0
pressing quality and sonics 55the music appears to be remixed as seems really apparent on this issue  this set was to include a digital download but mine was goofy and the record company wouldnt let me have it made my own 24bit copy of the lp anywaydefinitely recommended especially for the superfan|1
i like le mystere des voix bulgares a great deal and this cd was recommended to me as a result but what appeals to me about lmdvb is the dense rich harmony and there was some of that here but for the most part  it just sounds like 3 or 4 people each singing a different song i got my  first clue that this may not be my cup of tea when i saw that the choir  only consists of 12 men thats just too thin for my tastes feel free to  give it a shot but just dont expect the male version of  lmdvb like i did|0
i cant understand how this set of cds got so many rave reviews  peter hurford is a very sloppy organist  he misses notes all over the place has very messy rhythms and a very nonbaroque interpretation of bachs music  it makes me wonder if some of the other reviewers who play organ have only had a few lessons but little or no formal music training  this set of discs was so disappointing and annoying that i actually threw them away  if you want to listen to great organ music try some michael murray|0
music great but the disk was badit was very noisy when the disk was trying to loadafter many tries i got it loaded|0
wowif anyone could sum up this album in one word that would be it  the wall is not only the ultimate pink floyd albumin my opinion at least it is the most creative and aweinspring recording probably ever  from the explosive opening guitar riff of in the flesh to the  final harmonies of outside the wall the wall takes the most  extensive journey of the mind heart and soul of any rock album ever made  with the excellent production of bob ezrin who also produced kiss classic  destroyer to the legendary david gilmour and of course the brainchild  of the whole thing roger waters the floyd told the story of a man who was  at war his whole life with one person  himself  from the death of his  father in wwii his overprotective mother his superstardom as a rock  musician and the excess which accompanied it his unfaithful wife his  inability to cope with the rest of the world and finally his freefall  into insanity no other recording in history has come as close to telling  an actual story so completely and masterfully in just the confines of  music  while experiencing the wall one cant help but feel the angst of  another brick in the wall part 2 the confusion of empty  spaces the uncontrollable rage of one of my turns the  hopelessness of goodbye cruel world and the guilt of the  trial  this album never fails to get my emotions going and one of  the unique qualities the wall has it that one discovers something new in  it with each listen  the outstanding production covered all the bases  there are hidden messages behind every background noise spoken phrase  etc to help bring the entire plot together  this is without a doubt my  favorite album out of my entire catalog and something i can never let sit  long enough to collect any dust  so in closing sit back with an open  ear an open mind take the time to listen to all of the lyrics and enjoy  arguably the best album of all timeisnt this where|1
the sound track the wall is most probably the best rock album in history  this cd combines rock theatre and an alter state of conscienceness  i highly reccomend this musical journey through roger waters mind|1
i have this cd and the beat is too monotonic i honestly think pual can do much better i just feel that this isnt his best work if you want to hear oakie the listen to tranceport or save your money and get something by the  ministry of sound they never fail to disapoint|0
i intensely dislike abstract modern music having had his third symphony and knowing dawn upshaws singing i was disgusted when she appeared only on the last track the the sounds are so discordant to me as to give me a headache in addition the case was cracked as most of them seem to be lately the recording of miserre is marvelous and i am going find ways to know what is on offerings in the future  maestro gorecki is a wonderful talent but there is always the chance of a clinker|0
its neat kids can relate and listenbut i didnt laugh once|0
i did buy this cd for me boyfriend he really liked most of the songs on this cd then he played some of the songs for a few friends and they wanted the cd also he told them we bought it on amazon|1
i saw them in concert never heard of them but left a fan of the group when the concert was over|1
new chickenfoot album is better than the first the vocals are incredible and the guitar work by joe is way better than the 1st album the solos really rock i thought that the songs on the 1st album all sounded the same and i didnt really want to listen to it much this album is different because the songs all have different sounds to them sammy singing is great here too like always even some of his lyrics are different from his usual stuff i like the 3 12 letters song its different there is a couple of slower songs that are really good as well chad smith and michael anthony tear it up as well great album overall and the recording of it is splendid sounds really good in your car crank it up to 11|1
halfway through the third track i peed in my pants|1
i use other music to induce sleep and relaxation and just thought to add this to the collection however use of familiar tunes that are woven into the piece actually pique the attention leading away from sleep|0
ridiculously funny this guy is such a crackup  when the hell is brian regan going to come out with another|1
i love his original songs and stylewhen mr whittaker tries to imitate someone else it comes out sounding forced there is only one song on this cd i find tolerable|0
the holy ghost hop is blasphemy  i cant speak for the rest of the album not being able to get past the hop  these days you can yodel any foolishness in the name of christ and people will buy it  i wish amazon had a negative star rating|0
the gaudier ensemble is a suburb group of players beautiful sound until they add the clarinet what a squawky tone this guy hasloose unsupported tone almost any high school player sounds as good true he plays perfectly in tune dynamicsexpression impeccable and he can probably tongue 16ths at mm180 but what good is all that when your tone is simply awful i avoid recordings by british groups whenever theres a prominent clarinet part and guess what groups my local npr station usually playsi dont know how fellow musicians conductors audiences can stand such mushmouthed clarinet tone as my son would say it really really sucks|0
this is one of my overall favorite albums of michael w smith its from his early years his second album and i love his raw talent at this stage  to compare him to more recent albums he has grown so much as an artist|1
purposefully i am writing this without having viewed any amazon customer reviews of this album deliberately i am writing this drunk for as latin speakers amongst you know in vino veritas the sober are a cautious loti start therefore with a handful of assumptions to wit the received  wisdom that pink floyds wish you were here is one of the great  statements of the rock n roll idiom and an express intention to debunk  that received wisdom to say not only is wish you were here an  inessential piece of art but it is by miles the most dispensable  watersera floyd record of them alli would like to think of course  that vocal amazon readership for whom by and large i have the greatest  respect are one with me but i realise that floydheads are a peculiar  unselfreflexive bunch so im skeptical that anyone other than a spotty  eighteen yearold stirrer with a limp bizkit or whatever it is this month  fixation will agree with me nevertheless i present my arguments to the  best of my ability and gleefully flip the bird to the dogmatic  footsoldiers of the floyd faithwish you were here is a  load of old rotargument  1 fifteen minute instrumentals in the key of  g do not a tune make shine on you crazy diamond is an elegy  so we all rehearse for syd barrett syd if we are all honest with  ourselves was a shortfused acidhead who in a shortfused career  produced a couple of minorleague  and quintessentially cambridgeeducated   gems see emily play but little else leaps to mind and a  lot of completely impenetrable pap the first part of the song in his  honour drones on for fifteen minutes largely in one chord says little of  any significance even about syd barrett and then fades out only to be  met with a reprise at the end of the album of a further twelve minutes  same key no further message instrumental solos which can only be  described as indulgent syd barrett after all wasnt even especially good  at the guitar david gilmour as we all now know is tremendous cafeacute  music but of little use other than to i those toked up to the eyeballs  who enjoy staring at candles and ii those young men who think they  understand the electric guitarargument  2 an extension of  dark side of the moon it is not this one is particularly  baffling where dark side of the moon at least purports to  comment on and therefore connect with the lot of the ordinary  man traversing themes such as time carpe diem sex money sanity  and amateur astronomy wish you were here comments solely on  the lot of the cambridgeeducated rock star not even roger waters so  adept at feeling that his listener ought to feel sorry for him can score a  sympathy vote here so syd had too much acid shame so floyds  accountants ripped them off diddums so the nasty record companies were  made money out of floyd capitalist pigs all such railing mark it from  the comfort of ones stately castle in oxfordshire is hardly calculated to  make any form of connection with the casual listener or the intent  listener a more copybook case of champagne socialism other than the  beatles taxman it is scarcely possible to imagineargument   3 the songs simply arent any good  the histrionics of shine on  you crazy diamond and the selfabsorption of welcome to the  machine and have a cigar are dealt with above  shine on has when it finally arrives a pretty enough chord  progression but the best part if half an hour of it methinks that urine  is being extracted  neither of the other two is particularly memorable for  its tune tone or sentiment the harder edge may have laid the way for the  content of animals but the content is so selfcentred as to  defy beliefwhich leaves the song wish you were here it is  a beautiful song as good as any waters  or the floyd with or without him   have ever devised it says more elegantly than in three entire discs  almost everything of merit which waters was getting at in the wall and the  final cut and for that matter most of his solo material but it only  goes for five minutes and five subliminal minutes cannot justify forty  other minutes of rubbishgo on  vote me as unhelpful as you like but i  say that wish you were here is bar none the silliest record  the watersinvolved floyd ever came up with by a country mile im afraid  however mr gilmour this does not include or excuse either of a  momentary lapse of reason or the division bell|0
yes a little play on the name of the group  but if you are a fan of rush then this will be a welcome addition to your collection as it is to mine  even after all this time these guys still rock  they have proven themselves to be world class musicians  tight music tight lyrics  a tight bandpeople may think that they have outlived their usefulness  and if you think that you could not be more wrong  if it has been awhile since you have listened to rush  by all means get this cd  if you never heard of rush and you may not have  again get this cd|1
good riffs catchy beats crappy singer sorry all you fivestar dispering fans but  such a promising band shouldnt be destroyed on the account of one man but here is a prime example the selfish suave romantic who is sure he has what it takes to lead the band to the top of the charts sorry guys but you failed this time come back with a new album featuring an easier voice and i might look into it|0
met far and above my wishes as i knew that it would it brought back memories of the last time i heard their musicthank you|0
i heard the song anastasia on the radio and had to buy this releaselove the introand the two awesome leads he throws in ive listened tothe song over and overjust cant get enoughthere is a diverse collection of songs and most of them are quite goodi had not followed slashs career until nowi have a new respect for his workmyles kennedy lends a supersonic voice  and lyricsyou can hear some of their influences such as the rhythm on bad rainsounds like immigrant song by led zepoverall im am happy with my purchase and searching out some of slashs previous music|1
its too bad that nobody in america really knows the truth about the white  albumthat lennon and mccartney completely ripped it off from the  unrealeased untitled mashed potatoes masterpiece from 1968 i should  knowi was in the bloody band if we only knew that when john and paul  were hanging around the primal barn watching us record classics like  ode to sidz and the black man that they were just  going to go ahead and pillage us sure we hung out with them at abbey road  during the making of this album yes thats 557 playing that thundering  unforgiving bass line on helter skelter and that is nile singing why  dont we do it in the road not paul mccartney but we didnt think  it would actually be released thieves sure and revolution 9  just came out of thin air rubbishwe recorded rise humanoids  with john and george present at the primal barn and a ton of lsd i might  add three months before i saw john in new york in the mid 70s when we  were jamming with lou reed and he even admitted that they stole from us he  even admitted to me that fruit pie was the inspiration for  cry baby cry its now time for the others to fess up if  ringo hadnt stolen the master tapes from the barn after a night of heavy  boozing with us and hermans hermits we could show the world that we were  the true innovators of rock and roll long live mashed potatoes|0
every track is a masterpiece not a sleeper on the whole album  i havent felt this level of awe since 1993 a spectacular story told in this concept album no doubt this will be a hard one to top but we know rush can do it|1
you have to listen to this album a lot to figure it out  it can be very depressing and sad but the band is definitely making a statement about the futility of everything  this album really shows neil pearts predisposition to trust in anything religiouslike  however musicwise i think this album may contain some of rushs best work  it is not a classic rocker like moving pictures but the complexities of this album will keep the listener constantly engaged|1
considering the quality of the first batman score by danny elfman this soundtrack falls way too short compared to the original batman moviefirst of all and maybe most important reason why this one is a major dissapointment is the fact that the entire score is a lot more lighthearted than the first batman scoremainly because elfman uses a lot of percussion and the orchestra unleashes its power very sparingly except when the batman theme playsalso the addition of a choire is a good thought but its only female voices that are chanting and so its not really powerful a darker chorus would definitely be more fitting for gotham citythen the themes first theres the theme of the penguin to get to the point quickly its very similar to edward scissorhands and because of the circussound it sounds very cheesy the theme of catwoman consists of very highpitched strings in fact so hightpitched that its almost unlistenableseriously its a good idea to make the theme similar to the snarling of a cat but for this you just cant abandon listenabilitythe batman theme itself is good but its tough to screw this one up thoughthe score as a whole has no real flow to it the themes are just too different to combine properlyadditionally this score lacks reverb i suggest that it was recorded in a very tiny auditorium and consequently it lacks even more powerthis soundtrack is only for real batmanelfman fans or completists its definitely not an enjoyable score|0
its annoying to me when people say its good but its not like the last album  but when it sounds like the last album then people say oh theyre not creative  its a copy of the last album  well this is not stagnant by any means  considering that chickenfoot is basically a side project for all these guys im impressed with their creativity  and toss in there that chad smith recorded the new rhcp album then jumped back over to record chickenfoot iii and is now getting ready to tour with rhcp  i loved the first album a lot  it did feel to me like just some guys getting together and having fun nothing too serious etc  this release however seems to have more thought put into it  theyve taken on a few current subjects in an interesting fashion ie the current unemployment picture for a lot of people  this one also feels like theyve stretched their wings no pun intended a bit lyrically and accoustically  its not all volume maxed out type songs  one track somthing gone wrong which has some accoustic guitar that i had to back up and listen to again  its good damn good  then theres sammys vocals  hes gone and pushed himself a bit  some lower tone vocals on a couple tracks surprised me that hed even go outside what seems like his comfort zone  all in all im once again thrilled that i could buy great rock music for a reasonable price  yes i said buy  i actually bought the cddvd combo at a local electronics store  i could have got it for free easily but ive come to the point that if an artist gives me great entertainment at a price that is reasonable im buying  and given the exhileration i had at the denver stop on their first tour and for the price im all over it again next round  keep it coming foot im hooked  just dont start charging 100 for tickets through ticketastard with their rediculous fees and ill keep coming and bringing my friendsthis isnt rolling stones type music theyve been irrelevant for more than 20 years but people still buy tickets  the foot on the other hand is showing on their second release that theyre creativity hasnt faded a bit  satrianis guitarwell what can be said that hasnt been said  amazing stuff leaves me almost speachless  anthonys bass playing is always reliable but he comes out a lot more on the vocals side on this disc and it sounds great  seems to add more depth to the songs  not much ado is made of drummers these days but i have to say that i believe chad smith is on par with the likes of neal peart charlie watts or carter beauford  all of which are amazing drummers in my book  smith is able to switch between bands with very different styles and put together percussion sets that fit artistically and beautifully  hagar just seems to weave his vocals all around these rock heros without ever stepping on anyone  hes a master of that ive always felt and his talent shines better on this disc than the first release in my opinion  more creativity more range  more impressivethe dvd that came with my cd consisted mostly of videos that had already been on the bands web site but there is still some extra stuff that is worth viewing  its fun to hear them talk about the writing and recording but they are also giving a sales pitch  i guess im ok with that considering what ive paid for some great rock jams from these guys  i have to say im usually not impressed with heavy marketing of things like music but i have really enjoyed the web site the commercial i saw on tv the other night and i alway enjoy hagars overly enthusiastic sound bites  if i had his talent i think id live my life just like he isif you liked the first cd youre going to like this one too  just dont expect it to be a carbon copy of the first disc  even old rockers like to explore new ground  go out and buy this one its well worth it  youll get a free pair of 3d glasses as a souvenir|1
he is fun and teaches  respect kindness and laughter    im a grandma now and i buy this for my grandchildren  this is a great takealong in the car cd  vs the radio junk|1
like a lot of music these days this sounds over compressed and washed out with too much over dubbing  it may sound best on very flatly equalized near field studio monitors but does not sound good with headphones at least the ones ive tried akg  bose  i have had to fiddle with equalization all the time to get the songs to punch me in the face more  geddys vocals are often difficult to understand  i am going to run it through my pa speakers and see how it sounds then maybe im missing something important  that i just cant catch the groove of yetthat being said the song writing is interesting and artful and tightly performed  it doesnt seem all that progressive to me though in the sense of being breakthrough or edgy  not even many tricky time signature changesits still rush and whats not to love about these guys  god bless them and you|0
what can be the reason to release such a piece of s we have a wonderful xmas album available in three versions the original 12 tracks the same with some funny bonus tracks and the ultimate xmas addding the aborted second xmas album the original album is already quite short aaah the sixties  we dont need this truncated copy run away from it |0

if you think youre never gonna hear another song from slash that sounds like its so easy  night train or maybe out ta get me then youre wrong this new album boasts of songs in the same vibe and more slash seems to play even better and faster and more diverse too myles kennedy should have accepted slashs offer a long time ago to do the velvet revolver albumshe sounds awesome specially on the song far away he sounds like ritchie kotzen and the great late ray gillen  badlands at the same time and his phrasing was done ala chris cornell nothing can be as good as that most of the songs he sings in an axl rose phrasing and style which is very hard to do and very much fits the songs also when you listen to this album it almost sounds like izzy stradlin is in the band or maybe im imagining this you almost wonder what this album will sound like if izzy and duff were playing duff is one hell of a base player the greatness of gnr was the base was so melodic and aggressive at the same time anyway  buy this cd and you will not be disappointed this kind of thing comes our way very rare i cant pick a fave song because they all sound very good almost the same feeling when you first popped your appetite for destruction tape on your boomboxhey myles have you ever considered singing forwith jake e lee i think you two will make one hell of a heavy bluesmetal album dream time|1
this is not a soundtrack to the dukes of hazzard but rather an album with songs sung by cast members most of the actors cant sing although john schneider and tom wopat have decent voices one of the most disappointing things about this cd is that the dukes of hazzard theme song is not performed by original artist waylon jennings but is instead by the generic hazzard county boys other than that the rest of the album is pretty bad the general lee is one of the worst songs ever recorded by the great johnny cash sung from the point of view of the duke boys car there is a terrible cover version of the bands classic up on cripple creek sung by tom wopat the rest of the songs are all originals and none of them are any good this album will only appeal to hardcore dukes of hazzard fans|0
i have several ron kenolys cds as well as work he has done with hosanna integrity series in the 80s and 90s  i would say between him darlene zschech and phillips craig and dean  i listen to him close to 50 of the time nearly everyday  that said i forgot why i didnt have this in my collection so i ordered itnow i remember i gave it away  for some reason i dont feel the holy spirits power like i do in so many of his other works such as majesty jesus is alive lift him up and god is able which are all 5 star cds in my opinion sing out to me isnt on the same level or higher as other reviewers have statedfor me the songs on this cd sound pretty much the same to one another  i know we are to walk by faith and these are inspirational but they lack the power  to me it is like comparing apples to oranges  while i find the other cds of his to be powerful in their worship and praise and a nice variety  i just dont get inspired when listening to this cd i get so much more out of his other works i would put this on the bottom of my list of must havesi really wished i could be more complimentary the difference between my perception and that of others posted show that we all have different tastes and needs|0
this is the stuff that makes me wonder if god really is there because music like this is consumate pink floyd are deities and this album is proof of their brilliance i am 18  brilliant music doesnt die|1

flyleaf is lacey mosley lead vocals jared hartmann guitar pat seals bass sameer bhattacharya guitar james culpepper drumsmosley the 24 year old lead singer who fronts the band has a voice that sounds sweet and breathy one moment yet will jar your soul out of complacency with a growl and scream that strikes like a viper without warning this five member band comes from temple tx with a ferocity that says hey here we arehardcore fans will devour this standout debut from flyleaf who is just starting their inaugural headline tour with staind in the uk to support their debut album they are touring with cold staind pod and taproot after having earned new fans playing in front of saliva breaking benjamin 3 doors down and trust company audiences during the spring 2005 tour supporting flyleaf ep releaseriproaring guitar brooding beats and emotionallydriven lyrical delivery from mosley combine to create the distinct flyleaf sound of beautiful aggression it is a sound that is hard to describe because it can change in an instant in some ways this captures a specific aspect of humanity in that our thoughts can be simple yet we complicate them by mulling them around in our finite brains which creates chaos that becomesconfusion a jumbled pile of hurt brokenness healing setback anger redemption faith security sadness and hope like a silver orb in a pinball machine our thoughts bounce all around agitated and unsettled ceasing only now and then for restthe first single off the album im so sick is garnering much attention and winning instant flyleaf fans driving bass lines carry along the esoteric and atmospheric guitar that provide the foundation over which mosley sings a very melodic i will break into your thoughts with whats written on my heart and then she cuts with a growl that means business i will break break this single is quite representative of the flyleaf soundfully alive perfect all around breathe today and so i thought a very strong balladtype song and there for you showcase the beauty of mosleys intimate voice on the softer side while im so sick im sorry cassie and red sam demonstrate through growling and intense vocal singing that this young woman has something important to say and you better be listening this debut is a deluge of talent from this young singera favorite off the cd is cassie which features the story of cassie bernall the heroine of columbine fame who when asked if she believed in god responded yes that yes was fatal to her body but believers everywhere understand that cassies spirit lives on this song captures the intensity of that moment and what it meant to be asked or should mean to any believer when asked do you believe in god mosley sings with a defiant and definitive how many will die i will die i i will say yeeeeesssssss another interesting thing to note about the lyrics is that they are written to say cassie pulled the trigger implying that she with her faith in god was in complete control of the situationthe question asked in orderto save her life or take itthe answer no to avoid deaththe answer yes would make itand cassie pulled the triggerthis debut showcases the powerful pipes of lacey mosley and musicianship of the band members who make up flyleaf the songs are honest and always offer hope and positive messages the driving metal sound is catalpulting their message to mainstream audiences who desperately need to hear them no doubt that controversy will follow this band with people asking is flyleaf a christian band or not but to me it seems obvious through the lyrics of their music that their hope lies in the savior himselffrom the flyleaf biowhile many loud rockers reopen old wounds by singing about their broken homes and broken hearts flyleaf confront past traumas to heal old scars and prove in the process that hope shines brighter than despairflyleafs selftitled debut album echoes with songs about abuse neglect addiction and dysfunction and messages about overcoming adversity and the bands wide array of brooding beats atmospheric textures and lunging riffs compliment mosleys emotionally revealing lyrics which range from breathy and beautiful to scathing and aggressivethe blank page that one finds at the beginning of a book when it is first opened up is the flyleaf it is the page that one writes a note usually a personal note to a friend when they give the book as a gift through amazing spiritual and sometimes gutwrenching lyrics and their emotionally charged metal driven music flyleaf is penning the dedication on that blank page and its a positive and hopeful message to their fans and to hardcore rock music lovers everywhere|1

51 year old fossil rush fan here  first saw them live during a farewell to kings tour and was blown away and hooked by their masterful sound and world class approach to rock music  this october will be my 50th live rush concert since the 70s in 4 states states of euphoria ecstacy intensity and incredulity just kidding  that said i wont analyze the songs on clockwork angels as that has already been done here ad nauseum and besides this can be subjective based on personal tastes and poetic interpretation  rush has always been about quality and musical evolution and change given their many memorable forays into different sonic styles and elements clockwork angels is no different  musicality and song writing is top notch and cd sonics are above average for all you audiophiles out there  the songs are excellent and if i had to pick a standout favorite it would be the wreckers  what a gorgeous emotive and introspective tune  i cant get it out of my mind  thank you geddy alex and neil for sharing your immense gift of music all these years with the rest of the world  you guys are timeless  now please play greece and israel i have cousins there who are huge longtime fans and would love to see you|1

its safe to say that no matter how good a bands laterera work is it will never quite be as fresh and urgent as their classic releases earlier in their career  there will always be that missing element of youthful selfdiscovery or rapid evolution  that being said rushs clockwork angels still ranks as a true return to form  having discovered rush as a college freshman entering his second semester in early 1991 i missed out on hearing the bands prime sequence releases as they came out with the possible exception of having seen the bands video for distant early warning back in my youth  in that sense though i was lucky to be able to judge the bands work to date all at the same time and i was quite excited to discover this band that seemed to take all kinds of mainstream rock influences and mix them all into a great careerspanning sound that never felt contrived  sadly it seems that none of the new rush album debuts that id bear witness to as a fan could live up to my initial excitement in early 1991  the nadir would have to be the midnight release of test for echo in the mid1990s where it seemed not one of the songs made any kind of impression on me in the slightest although in retrospect some of the songs did manage to stand the test of timeclockwork angels thankfully brings with it at least a fair measure of that intangible excitement i was craving  its not just the hunger for rush to return to progrock conceptualism a la 2112 or the cygnus x1 songs that produces that sensation its that for the first time in a long time rush seems to not be holding back and is really conveying a sense of their own passion through the structure and performance of these songs  while prior studio release snakes and arrows had some pretty good cuts such as far cry armor and sword and the main monkey business there was still some of that leftover polite restraint that was far too dominant in test for echo albeit with a decent measure of energy starting to kick back in  long story short the album succeeds in large part because the band is utilizing one of their key strengths writing really catchy songs that are complex but still pay some respect to traditional song structures and performing those songs like they mean every second of it and then somedont approach this album expecting songs that are fully in the vein of their more complex work even though there are still more shades of the kind of music on a farewell to kings or permanent waves than there have been in over 2 decades  the title track exudes the sort of shimmery ethereal spaciness of xanadu but in a more straightforward manner while alex lifesons soloing in caravan will remind the listener of his offkilter breakdown in la villa strangiato  yes alexs guitar solos are definitely more frequent here than theyve been in quite a while but just as important is a departure from the sonic dogma approach that would typify certain albums  instead of insisting on focusing on keyboards leaving out keyboards entirely having an ultralight sound or going for a dirty gritty sound the album is welllayered with the different instruments and the vocals all contributing to a bigger picture  and while the band can kick it out bigtime with the expected syncopated powerriffing in headlong flight the aforementioned caravan or bu2b its the surprisingly high quality of hidden gems such as the poorlynamed but awesome carnies which packs a lot of shifting dynamics into its run time and the incredibly dark yet catchy and lush the wreckers which channels a bit of the spirit of afterimage that seals the dealwhile im still debating whether this is their best album since counterparts since presto or since a show of hands my first cd i should note that the album isnt perfect  while not a bad song seven cities of gold rides the same riff far too often for an over 6 minute song do love the cowbell though  similarly wish them well isnt poorly written or performed but seems to be satisfied just being a vehicle for the lyrical content as opposed to really grabbing the listener  that being said the fact that these are the weakest songs on clockwork angels speaks volumes of the overall quality of the experience  i should also note that the lyrics deserve to be credited with managing to both succeed at providing exposition for the main characters story arc and at succeeding in artfully exploring themes that are relevant to all of us individuality bitterness earned pessimism forgiveness mortality and much more  its to the bands credit that theyve managed a difficult feat creating a concept album with a defined story that manages to avoid many of the pitfalls of that type of work  then again id expect nothing less from rushand long may they continue to meet those standards|1
if ya grew up in the 60or not this has gots lots of goodies which you can listen to over and over again ad this to your 60s collection|1

green days original two independent eps were released as this cd on lookout records from the beginning you can tell that this is a very young band whom have a lot of work cut out for them this isnt the green day of today or even the green day of 1994 the recording quality overall is relatively poor and it follows a pretty simple chord structure throughout most of the music which was very indicative of punk at the time of the release the songs are very fast paced and it is a quick listen despite the fact that there are nineteen tracks some of the songs dont seem to have anything to do with their titles but what else would one expect from the band that encouraged people to throw mud at woodstock 94 overall id say dont get this cd unless youre a hardcore green day fan but then again if youre a major green day fan and dont have this one then something is wrong if youre a casual fan check out the samples of it on amazon and if you like it pick it upfavorite tracksat the library  the song is relatively catchy it is about a guy who is trying to work up the balls to talk to a girl in the library when he doesnt get the nerve to talk to her he blames her for leavinggoing to pasalacqua  a good track placed right in the middle of a few that just dont have a very good beat to themknowledge  it has a swingy jazzy 12 bar blues feel so i liked it right off the bat since thats one of my favorite genres all i know is that i dont know is a catchy line and the guitar solo was played quite simply albeit over the blues structure the harmonica was a surprise but still prettycooli want to be alone  this song is the one song on the cd that is not very punk at all the music is for the most part a normal rock pattern there isnt much of an apparent showing of the punk style of the rest of the cd it almost feels out of place but it is a song indicative of more of their songs off of dookie|0
this is quite simply the worst musical ever written  boring selfindulgent and completely lacking in charm  it is difficult to sing worse to listen to and impossible to sit through  sondheim fans rant and rave about its technical superiority in terms of musical sophistication  sophisticated it is entertaining it most definitely is not  i honestly never expected to find a musical i didnt like but in this case i did  do not buy this album do not go to see this show  it is art for arts sake and that should never be encouraged|0
many of the other reviewers have commented on the shamefully short running time so i wont focus much on that i just want to note that i have many single discs in my collection with 30 songs and nearly eighty minutes of music this takes two discs to present 26 songs topping out at 66 minutesthere are other flaws as well itd be nice if there were liner notes and remastered sound the song selection is haphazard at best theres no twist and shout i saw her standing there in my opinion the groups greatest rockers do you want to know a secret ps i love you or got to get you into my life all huge hits recorded during the era though the latter would not reach the top ten until 1976 three years after this was originally compiled also many primo album tracks like money are not here and for collectors theres not a single rarity in sightthe material that is here is pretty choice though there may be a toss off clunker or two like michelle or love me do which are still half decent but the majority of whats here is some of the finest and most influential rock and roll ever recorded capturing the spirit of early rock and hinting towards greater sophistication if not better music still though a novice would be better off with beatles one or even diving straight into the original lps that except for the last are all essential listening it should be mentioned though that not even these have been remastered or compiled with any real scholarship its a shame because with the splendid recent upgrades of the beach boys and ricky nelson catalogues capitol really showed that they know how reissues should be done if only the beatles were accorded the same treatment|0
i love listening to these songs and my 17monthold son gives me a huge smile every time i play these songs  the songs are great for adults as well as kids  i love the kid friendly lyrics to goodnight irene  i know that we will be listening to these cds for years and that my son will be singing them to his children  a must have for every parent|1
this is amon the worst beethoven recordings ive heard  and yes i own this set and regret having paid nearly 50 for it the two players here apparently try to outdo each other with technical speed with no emotional expression or a true appreciation for beethovens great music whatsoever how the other reviewers could rate this terrible performance highly baffles me completely even the muffled recording on the beethoven edition set is way better than this onebut for a truly great performance of these sonatas get theludwig van beethoven the sonatas for piano and violin  wilhelm kempff  wolfgang schneiderhanset no other recordings come even close|0
not recommendedtoo many pointless modulations some of which are to a wrong chord or wrong keythe scherzo is abruptly truncated and along with the finale contains material lifted from the 9th symphony along with inferior counterpointschubert would never have let somthing like this escape from his penit has pleasant moments but taken as a whole is annoying to listen to im sorry i wasted my money on it|0
let me start out by saying that the chances of me getting the rest of the beatles remastered is about 99 as for this cd it sounds almost identical to the 1987 release granted the sound is a little louder than 1987 what i didnt care for was the seperation the beatles themselves admitted they were not to crazy about the musical instruments on one channel and their vocals on the other channel they have the technology to have done better my opinion  i was expecting to hear songs like nowhere man and think for yourself to sound like they did on the 1999 release of yellow submarine songtrack great stereo soundalso i was expecting three of the songs to last a couple seconds longer sorry to be picky you wont see me the word and im looking through you were longer on the american release fortunitlly they can be heard on the capitol albums vol2 cd collection  the one major disappointment is the false start on im looking through you was not on this cd wher it can be heard on capitol albums vol2i dont know how the rest of the cds will sound yet i will know as i buy each one at a time i may not get yellow submarine because the great stereo sound is available the 1999 releaseps  i also agree with the reviews stating that the 2009 remastered release should be seperate from the 1980s release|0
love the music even better than the first cd  shows the band has allot of depth to there songs and style of music they can produce|1
the beatles had one formula and boy they sure stuck with it a hard days night is a fun song to listen to as usual its nothing really great but its fun i should have known better gets on my nerves tremendously but  then so does the majority of their music actually theres really not much  to say about this album i agree with the reviews that said it sounds the  same so theres really no use for me to talk about each song all in all  its a pretty dull album and if you want to hear good music from the early  sixties then listen to the stones insteadat least their early stuff was  always interesting|0
i own this and i got it for a friend this is beautiful music and it does help you think about when jesus was born and it gives you this feeling of wonder and mystery|1
im amazed that this album has actually received bad reviewshas our culture become so banal that spearsjackson pop music is the base line this is art folks if you have any self awareness this album will affect you damn it it should make you at the very least teary eyedi admit that i blur the album and the film into one experience the whole project is amazing  that includes the live dvd performance in berlinwar insanity drug use fame authority figures who dont give a damn that includes your precious little mommy selfabsorption and the desperate need for longing   come on folks you got to be kidding when you trash this albumhow can one not feel when pink calls home and his wifes lover answers the damn phone then again maybe youve never been completely betrayed during a moment of adulterated innocence and weaknesssure i have every pink floyd album and then some the wall isnt the typical psychadelic experimental mastery that one might typically equate with this band but the apparent simplicity is the geniusthis is pink floyd this is a masterpiececenturies from now adolescents and adults who can empathize with that angst of just being will embrace this albumbuy it|1
i heard one cut on the cd on the local jazz radio station and bought the recording  it is filled with dissonance and unpleasant riffs  i couldnt bear to give it another listen  it has an allstar cast of players but they all seem to be playing something different  save your money|0
i liked it  it deserves 5 stars|1
i purchased both volumes one and two and have loved every minute of it i would recommend using as it keeps the exercise focused and the routine from going as it should be performed|1

lets see brother russell calls ted a hate filled homophobe yet he is the one who has targeted christians for their beliefs with his twisted venom  i guess tolerance is selective for brother russellwhen someone dislikes a particular group to the extent that they make a cd and i guess some sort of a pathetic career out of prank phone calls then you know that person is unbalanced and obsessed  if you despise christians in the name of tolerance and share and unnatural hatred of someone whose faith you do not share by all means purchase this cd  i think you would be better off however with some quiet introspection as to why you would harbor such intense feelingsi have found most people who harbor this type of venom towards christianity either have a sin issue or a fear that christians are right and someday they will have to face god and account for themselves|0
upon buying the double albulmthe walland listening to it you will find yourself intranced and listening to certain songs over  over againone of my favorites is another brick in the wall parts 123  the arrangment of music is supurbley written  arranged blending the  end of one song into the start of anotheralmost without you knowing it  the album is about a young man child that has lost his father to the  war a very tramatic event for hisself and him trying to bond with the  closets people around hisself his sadistic mother or the abusive teachers  of school in short the story made up of songsis about a child growing  up without his father throghout life suffers from the bad experinceand  has a mental breakdown the whole story from start to finishis set in  words and music that one can relate to in one way or another the albulm  leaves you wanting more also check out darkside of the  moonanimalswish you were herea  seranade of dance songs  do you start to see a pattern in the  albulmspertaining the way the wall is described here|1

this album sounded good the first time i listened to it and it get better each and every time thereafter  this is a concept album which i love but a lot of other people dont likethe theme of the album is this  youre going to get screwed over and crapped on by other evil and hateful people but you need to let all the hate angst and hatred go that is in your heart and just pursue your own happiness and wish them well  i wish i was mature enough to follow the advice but my hate and angst still drive me  remember neil peartthe drummer and lyricist lost his wife and daughter within 6 months of each other so hes been to hell and backi love the lyrics liner notes the sound the singing everything  i think it is one of their best efforts if not the best everi dont care what the other rush fans say and i cant wait to see them live in atlanta on november 1 2012|1

i bought this cd thinking it was a newly released highlights cd of the original london cast cd with colm wilkinson patti lupone michael ball  francis ruffle its not what a great way to get people to bye the  cd i really havent listened to it because i was disgusted at the fact  that i was lured into buying a cd under false pretences  i did listen to  some and it sounds like kareoke music and fantine was vocally weak this is  not a cast recording but a studio recording i can tell you the actors who  sing the parts though something i wouldve wanted to know before buying  but i didnt have that chance so here it isvaljean  javert   john curl fantine  cosette  lindsey stafford smith marius  christopher smith enjolras adam pinter thenaridierjulian emery m  thenardier catherine watsonuhhh why have the same man sing 2  different parts okay maybe i can see the same woman singing the mother  and daughter but the rivalssong list at the end of the dayi  dreamed a dreamwho am ifantines death confrontation master of  the house stars abc cafe red and black do you here the people  sing a heart full of lovesongs only from act i of les mizanyhow  the singers could turn out to be good for all i know but i was just upset  that it wasnt what it said it was although it wasnt listed as having  colm and patti it did say original london cast so at least  now you can purchase this cd fully aware that its not the london cast |0

well its like this im mainly an admirer of pink floyds oldschool work if anything their first hit single and known released song far as i know arnold layne still is my favorite if i had to pick just one that having been said see emily play was great too my absolute favorite is debatable between dark side of the moon  the 2nd best selling album ever behind michael jacksons thriller or the very touchy thought provoking wish you were here particularly its centerpiece track  especially parts 56789 animals was good 1 or 2 songs better than others but as was definitely the case with 1983s final cut this just sounds more like a roger waters solo album versus pink floyd as theyre defined by|0
i only like one song on this album sheep all the rest are just really not that good i think this was an album to do good and in a way it did i suppose i would have hated to be at the particular concert where roger waters spat on that young ladall in all it is just another brick in the wall|0

i was greatly disappointed by the sound quality of this cd when compared to my vinyl copy of the same title|0
at the beginning of each track you get to hear a little bit of the guitar playing that i bought the disc for but then all the horrible sounds that is supposed to be singing i quess starts in and ruins any expected enjoyment i went out to the balcony and sailed it like a frisbee|0

revolver is without doubt my favorite beatles album and one of my alltime favorites by any band or performer  i had the old version of this cd the one with the plastic jewel case and was always rather dissapointed with the rather poor sound quality nothing can beat the sound quality of vinyl  so i was so happy to see this album remastered and sold seperately without having to purchase the entire catalog as a box set i cannot begin to convey my utter dissapointment with this cd  were they kidding when they called it remastered  it must be some sort of sick joke  there is absolutely no difference in sound quality between this version and the old one  if you already own the old version the one that comes in a plastic jewel case then thats all you need  dont waste your money like i did thinking that youre going to finally get a copy of revolver that has superior sound quality  aside from some fancy packaging this rerelease is nothing but a real letdown|0
my baby loves raffi the price was right on these but they are not as good as the last set we bought  the one with rise and shine  everybody grows and 1 other are much better songs these cds are a bit heavy on religion and too calm|1
im an avid fan of pink floyd but i was extremely disappointed with this album i wish i could give it zero stars a few previous reviews have already mentioned this but it bears repeating this is a roger waters album not a pink floyd album when this album was recorded rick wright was booted from the band and waters reached his megalomaniacal peak in artisitic control over their music while gilmour and nick mason were still around this was essentially a roger waters album with lackluster music and contrived songwriting need further proof check waters dismal work since leaving pf after this albumnuff said hell even gilmour admitted that he wished they didnt release this bomb save your money for either their old stuff or momentary lapse of reason and thereafteryoull be glad you did|0
i give this 2 stars because its not completely worthless not completely devoid of musical appeal  but let us be frank any piano performance graduate could play in same fashion and many would do this betterthere is very little music i hear in this recording but much brash ponderous and near methodical banging  everything is heavy and slow nothing is sparkling or melodic  this is not a good interpretation of either piece  both requiring long sustained melodic lines  his playing might have been better suited to prokovief|0
i cant believe how awesome this special edition is the first day i got it i must have watched the dvd at least three times it is so amazing and the acoustic tracks just make you fall in love with flyleaf all over again a must have for flyleaf fans|1
thank you and good night was the first official live album released by samson great idea to release a live a albumits just 2 albums too late why did i say that because thank you and goodnight was released when samson was at their weakestwith nicky moore on vocals as you can tell the word great in my review title is used in a sarcastic mannerive stated before nicky moore isnt a very good vocalist his bluesy style vocals clash with samsons original nwobhm sound not only is he a lousy vocalist hes terrible with the crowd all he says is this is an old one and thank you and good night whats with playing with and talking to the crowd hes says minimal and does not know how to play the crowd at allanother problem is the tracklisting of course most of the material is from the nicky moore vocal albums before the storm and dont stay mad  get even though i never considered any of samsons albums considerably strong but those two are easily the weaker of samsons outputs there is only one song off of the bands debut survivors and second album head on whats shocking is that there is not one song off of the bands most successful album shock waves i dont know but maybe its a good thing cause nicky moore could murder those classic bruce dickinson samson songs like riding with the angelsthe production itself isnt overly strong the guitars sound good and everything but the vocal works is a little weak as they sound hallow and distant well with nicky moore maybe that isnt such a bad thingone the upside paul samsons guitar playing is fantastic he hits every mark perfectly great picking and great solos this man really was a god in the guitar world its a shame he never got the recognition he deservedoverall i have to say this is a below average live album other than some good guitar playing there is nothing really special on this release it lacks classic samson songs and vocalist nicky moore is boring i would only recommend this live album to samson collectors or fans of the nicky moore samson albums if there are any|0
i ordered this because i had never heard of itwell guess what its not real its a typo|0
thurman ehi saw these guys in london supporting these animal men  rumour had it that they had been a grunge act a year earlier and postblur bought themselves ben shermans and lept wholeheartedly on the bandwagonthe accents are appalling mockney nonsense the lyrics are cliche ridden drivel and the riffs have all been nickedthat said they are endearingly bad hence the 2 stars  but take it from me youd have to be from another country to find them even remotely credible|0

ive been a huge rush fan from the beginning  at the age of 45 ive had years to listen to all of rushs songs over and over  i was a little afraid of this their 20th album since most bands often do one last meh album before they fade off into obscurity  ive had issues with rushs albums ever since power windows  they mostly didnt have that oomph of albums past  they were more of a collection of a few ok songs one or two good ones and a whole lot of meh songsi must say that this album will blow you away  almost every song is a winner  some are quite lyrical and beautiful and some will knock your socks off  the mixing of this album is the best ive ever experiencedothers have done songbysong decriptions and have done a great job of capturing the feel  i will say that one song for me stands out more than any other  headlong flight  this song has probably already joined the list of baseline songs to use to test out stereo systems  i mean    wow  i didnt know you could get that deep of a tone in percussion and bass in a song  i thought when i first heard it that my stereo settings were messed up and i had the bass set for 11  but no it was at 0  the song will really let you know if you have a good subwooferspeakers and youd better make sure loose objects in your entertainment room are secured or that you dont have weak glass in your windows  be warnedkudos to geddy alex and neal  you hit a homerun with this album|1
i spent 3 for this cd at half priced books and found its still over priced i have never heard such a horrible bach or did ma really know he was playing bacha few years ago i went to mas live concert in chicago for bwv 1008 1009 1012 i could not believe that he played them like midi music but after i listened to this recording i realized that he was actually growing betterto be honest every time i went to his live concert i was extremely disappointed he is a good new age music player|0
i learned these inventions when i was 13 and played these bach pieces with more accuracy than janos  there are obvious errors and the tempo is not fixed  worse is the trills trills are supposed to be timed perfectly not a lets play some fast notes  stay away|0
good solid songs  its a fun listen and certainly worth buying  nice so see rush back to being a rock band|1
my local walmart put clockwork angels out a week before they should have i have listened to it numerous times since i am a rush addict with track marks to prove it  i swear  i have never felt such emotion beauty and grace in any of their previous works as i did with clockwork angels i believe this will be a hallmark event for rush and will be much deserved to me this is their pinnacle album and sadly could be there last rush has achieved the perfect album the songs are complex but each one has a melodic hook that stays with you it makes you smile cry and ponder what an investment for a mere 1200 thanks geddy alex and neil and most of all thanks to their producer nick who helped push them to achieve new heights  this album was made  for rush fans no one else they stood and delivered|1
with apologies to freddie mercury elton john aerosmith and rush the wall is the best album ever made curl up in bed with your lover and listen to this entire offering without interruption have the room dim enough so your eyes dont get bothered by reading the books on your nightstand or shelf let this music seep into you and you will be a changed person this music kept me from killing myself 20 years ago i hope it helps you as well|1
i have seen and heard tristan und isolde performances which had either a poor tristan or one that just got through the evening i remember three tenors at nilssons met debutbut here we have a perfectly intelligent artist waltraud meierall together out of her class giving the worst performance of isolde on recordwho told this artist she could sing one of the most demanding roles ever written a mezzo soprano no lessis barenboim out there or whatdoesnt anyone listen maybe we are really about money|0

they dont mess around with the music they produce they put out the music they want true rock and roll artistrythey just dont make it this way any more i own every album that i know of that they produced all are top notch|1
this recording is particularly notable for its rare inclusion of orchestral accompaniment in the scaramouche while the orchestra itself is unfortunately not in top form its still worth listening toit is disturbing that ryo noda who composed the japanese improvisation receives not a single mention or credit on the cd or in the liner notes the last work included it does not fit the rest of the disc being neither classicalstyle nor for orchestra sohre rahbaris performance is acceptable however she lacks technical polishthe remainder of the recording rehashes works which all saxophonists should already be familiar with and there are plenty of better recordings of these available|0
first of all let me say that im basing this review on op106 after i listened to it i didnt want to acquaint myself with the rest of the sonatas ive had the misfortune of coming across nimbus records before vlado perlemuter playing ravel springs to mind and saying that to avoid this set on the basis of the sound engineering alone is not an exaggeration the piano sounds muffled and vague as if recorded through a mattress as for the interpretation im afraid to say that mr roberts has a lot of extremely embarassing moments which completely spoiled the music for me im not talking about a wrong or missed note here and there but a whole bunch of them including the opening chords of the first movement if op106 is any indication of what the rest of the sonatas sound like then this is one set to avoid like the plague even at this price|0
what goes up must come down it happened to elvis michael jackson and the list goes on and oneven the beatles in 1969 came tumbling down this cd proves it  worn out mad beatles please give credit to paul and ringo however for putting out let it be naked which did save this period for the beatles|0
i ordered this recording recently to build up my rather small phantom collection containing only the original london cast recording and many mp3s that ive found on the internet i listened to the cd all the way through in little more than half an hour the short running time would not have irked me as much had half the emotion and talent of the original london cast been therethe whole cd seems rushed in a sense the singers arent all that bad but they appear to overlook many of the small details added in other recordings the background orchestrations are weak as well and many sound like i could have made them with a simple midi program on my computer its almost a shame to see such a great score and wonderful story ruined by this lack of emotion and inputand we come to the part of the play that matters most to me how good is the phantom well i rate the different phantoms by whether or not i had i been christine in the story would follow the phantom and choose him instead of raoul had the phantom shown up in my mirror with this mans voice i might wander back to raoul ive heard worse but it simply does not have the emotion the seductiveness and the longing that many of the other phantoms that ive heard haveif youre looking for another recording to add to your collection  id suggest the original vienna cast my personal favorite though you cant find it on amazon its worth it to find it somewhere else and order at least much more so than this belowpar recording|0
flyleaf has found quite a bit of success touring with bands like deftones their lead singer is female and she is tiny at that but dont let that turn you off this isnt another average girl fronted metal band like kittie she is able to convey so much emotion into every song it is unbelievable it is a very solid cd no filler im excited for their next one too because i think they have tons more potential i mean theyve already sold over 500000 copies of this one which is pretty darn good i dont think that everyone will like them though but if youre looking for something different as far as vocals go try them|1
the latest release by the best band in the universe does not disappoint fantastic piece of musicianship these guys are on top of their game|1
considering i play frisbee with this cd now this is without a doubt one of the worst albums ever put together i play two chords on a sixstring can i be in a band too gavin and all those guys can go to hell for all i care i dont know the other guys names because gavin gets so much attention hell when glycerine came out i thought bush was a solo artist because gavin was the only damn person in the video if i could deconstructed would get a big fat 0 from mei could not have been more happy when i listened to this cd see i never really liked bush to begin with but when millions of teenage girls swarmed radio stations with requests for bush and you could not walk into a grocery store without seeing some teen magazine with gavins mug on it i began to hate the band immensely i have problems with people who overrate bands for whatever reason so with all the girls screaming that gavin is god and the critics being too chicken to tell this band off you would think that bush actually had talent which they dont gavin has absolutely no range as a vocalist nor does he have any talent as a songwriter except he doesnt write the songs here and im not even sure he actually plays his guitar none of the other members put in any inspiring performances on their instruments the mere fact that this band is so popular makes me want to move to another planet and everyone thought they were rebels for listening to this stuff unbelievable|0
not any good but i bought it just for one song thats in it which is wonderful and the song was ok just ok|0

not a critique of the album but one of the packaging i have received 2 of these so far from amazon and they both had the same problem in that the cd gets stuck to the glue used to hold the cardboard packaging together when you try to pull the cd out the glue gets stuck on it making both of the copies i got unplayable i wish they would have just used a regular case or at least sealed the cardboard one up better|0
i bought this cd hoping for the original version of al di la which included the opening verse not the truncated version offered in so many other greatest hits packages these however are rerecordings made in possibly the early seventies the sound has a tremendous amount of echo which leads me to believe they may be mono recordings reengineered in fake stereo a female chorus has been annoyingly added to many of these songs and the tempi are considerably slower than the originals  no liner notes whatsoever to indicate where or when these recordings were made best place to find the original al di la eric 115092 hard to find 45s on cd vol5 or rhino r2 72577 eh paisano 100 italianamerican classics|0

this is another ponderous installment of harnoncourt muesli all three performances are seriously devoid of grace and wit the musical joke is a masterpiece in its own way the last thing it needs is a heavy handed underlining of its antinuances what with his incessant and ruinous pointmaking harnoncourt stifles its innate humourthe nannerl septet k 251 is similarly maltreated far from it being a gracious offering to mozarts sister on the occasion of her birthday in harnoncourts hands it is a rough beast that slouches its way towards salzburg to be bornthankfully the market has been innundated with so many first class renditions of k 525 that one does not have to endure the infelicities of harnoncourts eine kleine nachtmusik wilful tempos bulges in the melodic line and clipped phrasingi thought that period practice aspired to bring us closer to the composer  to touch the hem of their garmentnot here this is a mozart that i do not readily recognise nor care to know|0
time waits for no one this album might have been intresting when it was released but since then things have changed anyone who still calls this album the best or most important in popular rock music must be sleeping or already dead im a very open minded person especially when it comes to music and i also gave this album a lot of time and several listenings but i cant find anything here wich hasnt been done much better since then dont get me wrong the beatles were a great band who created a lot of wonderful music and youll definitely find some of it in here  but the hype about the white album is just ridiculous if youre intrested in music history then maybe this ones something for you but even then only out of general interest if youre expecting the religious experience the reviewers obvisiously had youll be very dissapointedif you want to hear a peak in popular rock music listen to for example use your illusion i  ii by guns n roses these are the kind of albums that deserve all the praise the white album gets these are the kind of albums that will have a huge impact on you these are the kind of albums that will keep you busy for years the white album is just something that looks good on the shelf and on top ten lists of those who want to but never will be cool sophisticated and educated cause they just dont get what music really is abouti dont mean any discrespect to the beatles or their fans but enough is just enough people should just listen to music with their ears and with their hearts instead of mistaking their own cd collection for a museum select your cds by your personal preferences not by their status if you like the white album by the beatles then you should definitely own it but thats the only reason for owning it youre still reading this but you still dont know if the music in here is good or not well download samples rent it from a friend and see for yourself just remember the less you write read and talk about music the more you can listen to it and the better chances are that you might get something out of it and i guess thats what its all about isnt itthe one star represents the way poeple treat music not the value this album id rate it solid 3 out of 5 according to my own preferences|0
a great effort from the boys up north  if youre a rush fan i think youll be very pleased if you have never liked them this wont change your mind  of course i havent met many middle of the road rush fans i like all the cuts on the album with the anarchist being possibly my favorite but tough to call its no mean feat to produce an album as original and quality as this after nearly 40 years all with the original sorry jr you werent around long three members my sincere hope is that well get a few more like this out of them before they decide to hang up the guitars basses  drumsticks  officially retire bravoedit i have seen a bunch of comments since my original post complaining about the quality of the sound on the album  no doubt the recording is dense but i just dont hear the kind of horrible compression and lack of clarity some people are hearing  there is a lot of bottomend and if i could remix it myself i might favor the highs a little more but it is right in line with what they have been producing for the past decade a denser darker sound  i dont hear anything like the digital clipping on vapor trails and even that i think some people tend to blow out of proportion it is not a good thing but doesnt ruin the album for me  my 2 cents worth|1
this titanic cd was given to me by someone  im sorry to say that i dont remember  when i got it i thought it would filled with more than the classical selections featured but nooo it seriously had two songs  like i thought were decent  personally i do not like this cd at all but  if a person liked the classical and background music in titanic then one  would like this cd|0

i mean come on other than the final cut nothing has even come close to matching the passion and complexity of this album this piece takes you on ride through pinks life the ups and downs the sanity and  insanity you cant beat it the fact that some say the plot lacks  enough coherence is absolutly appalling roger waters should be  commended for what he has done here every floyd fan should stand up and  cheer if you want to make your music collection complete then you need  this album if you want to make your floyd experiance complete buy this  cd listen to it watch the movie then listen to the album a thousand more  times then do it again heres to you roger the guitars the dirty women  and the people outside the wall|1

there are two versions of this 1957 recording thinking i was getting the better of the two i bought the remastered version and im so disappointed the sound is muddy and thin not rich and clear like i remember then there is the intrusive commentary between pieces would be so much better to be able to just go smoothly into the next music i ought to have taken to heart a previous review here that made that pointi was trying to locate the recording i remember from many years ago where the cannons were so real and so loud that they blew the speakers the reverse side of the 78 was bolero i think but since this particular item said it was remastered from the 1957 version and had cannons i thought it would be a good bet if this was remastered it wasnt done well i dont recommend this particular cd though the reproduction of the decca vinyl on the cd was cute|0

i am one of the bigger beatles fans out there but they didnt put out anything worth listening to until a couple of songs on help and a hard days night you cannot listen to this and complain about the teenyboppers today its just the singles padded with covers and neither are very good if you want to hear the reason that these guys were briefly  though not as briefly as the stones the best band in rock and roll listen to revolver or abbey road both of which are some of the alltime best albums ever written this is mindless fluff not worth the time it takes to listen to itsome people like the early beatles because its simple mindless and better to rock out to if you want that listen to the ramones they were simpler rocked more not to mention funnier but they werent teenyboppers if you want something by the beatles look past all of their first five|0
rushs 20th studio album clockwork angels finds the band revitalized and reinvigorated  it is hard to believe listening to this album that the band at work here has been kicking around since the 70s  while the songwriting here suggests that the band is experienced the energy and passion feels very young  lees vocals are strong his bass thudding lifesons guitarwork is just as interesting and pearts drums are mindboggling  clockwork angels is one of the best rush albums in several yearsbeginning with the excellent caravan the album chronicles a tale about a time traveler journeys  the motif of time is apparent throughout the album even in the albums name and artwork  neil pearts imagination fuels the lyrics here part sciencefiction part fantasy part sweeping epic apparently a novelization of clockwork angels is in the work  this opening track announces the bands energy its stomping chugging and energetic  many of these songs coalesce with one another  these tracks are strong on their own but they work the best within the context of the album  the album ends with the garden a primarily acoustic number that doubles as a thoughtful meditation on the mediation of life and time  perhaps its an unconventional way to end such a heavy album but in retrospect clockwork angels couldnt end any other waymy only real gripe with clockwork angels is the production  as with most of nick raskulineczs production there seems to be a lot of compression going on  it chokes the dynamics of the band but it makes them sound louder and rawerfor fans of rush this album is a treat  for listeners unfamiliar with the band clockwork angels turns out to be a good place to start listening along with moving pictures perhaps  listeners who dont care much for rush will probably not find a lot here to convince them otherwise its a lot of what made the band important in the first place  standout tracks to sampledownload caravan seven cities of gold and the garden|1

ive been reading the reviews for this cd and have seen all the comparisons and so far most of them are way off kittie no way lacey flyleaf screams very little while morgan lander kittie screams nonstop and even roars avril lavigne um no let it be known that flyleaf is their own band with one of the most distinctive vocalists ive heard in a long time on my first listen i wouldnt have given this more than a four star rating because i thought that maybe the band as a whole was trying a bit too hard in places but after countless listens im hardpressed to recall any truly weak moments at moments this cd feels like nothing more than pop with a heavy backdrop and other times it has an actual heavy feeling and thats what keeps this cd from getting blandflyleaf is one of the few bands that plays this type of music and can keep it fresh take evanescence for no reason at all their debut was wonderful but once you listened to it enough it got boring since i bought this cd ive played it countless times and still love every song just as much as the first time i heard them you could take just about any band on the radio right now and put this cd against one of theirs and flyleaf will no doubt blow it out of the water song for song this cd does not disappiont from the heavy opening of im so sick to the introspective there for you this cd covers both ends of the emotional spectrummy favorite songs are fully alive cassie all around me there for you and breathe today im sure most people can find something to like about this cd and band but i will also say that flyleaf may not be everyones cup of tea for instance when i first heard it i thought laceys voice got a bit agitating but its also lacey that gives this band a lot of credibility her lyrics are excellent and so unlike whats out today theres even times where the band steps up and makes some great melodies that go far beyond the typical radio band riff so kudos also goes to them so basically youre getting one of the best releases of 2005 with this cd so enjoy it|1
fun and relaxing music enjoy listening to it while driving the only minus is that some if the songs sound like rap which i dont care for but otherwise very satisfying|1

most of these tunes were originally released on tape and vinyl only for years it was believed the masters were lost apparently the original work was relocated or restored thank god these are some of my favorite bluegrass tunes it was once said that jack and lucy was the most requested song on a popular local bluegrass radio program it brings goose bumps i also love a few dollars more the title of the original album my foggy mountain home silver tongue and gold plated lies and i love to perform in my own band itll be me a very humorous and sad songthis is a classic must have for any bluegrass collection bill grant can be found performing on the same bluegrass circuits as ralph stanley and other original bluegrass giants|1
the melodians were a leading group during the rock steady era about 19658 specializing in love songs delivered with sweet harmonies  this compilation was put together with much love and care by heartbeat records irreplacable chris wilson who arranged for digital remastering from the original master tapes  those who used to collect the original jamaican 45s will be pleased with the improved sound the selection is a1  definitely the soul of jamaica|1
pink floyds the wall is one of those landmark albums that comes around every ten to twenty years or so and catches the ear of all who experience it drasticly different from the bands previous work most  notably because only two of its four members contribute to the writing  and also due to its being their to date most stripped down strait out  rock album one could argue that it does have its flaws which indeed it  does much of the songs are short seemingly added simply to tell the  walls complex story of mental anguish and psychological breakdown  obviously shorter songs like vera the show must go  on and dont leave me now could have benifitted from the  musical direction of either keyboardist richard wright or not the least a  bit more flow from guitarist david gilmour  but as it is the  wall is masterminded by its innitial visionary bassplayer roger  waters  significantly this album would be his last truely great piece of  work including his postpink floyd albums waters was inspired to write  the wall shortly after pink floyds animals world  tour during wich he nursed a hatred for playing vast sports stadiums due  to according to him the souless connection between band and audience but  as with any pink floyd album the pros drastically outnumber the cons if  indeed there are any the wall ultimately boasts some of pink  floyds most popular and best loved songs the ridiculously overplayed  another brick in the wall pt 2 the familiar acoustics of  mother and some of nick masons best drumming on in the  flesh david gilmours lone contributions give the album its best  tracks in run like hell young lust hey  you and the ultimate pink floyd song comfortably numb  derived from an unused demo off of his previous years solo album the duet  vocals of waters on verses and gilmour on chorus to the latter song is  absolutley breathtaking the wall indeed is a wonderous exploration  of what a concept album can be and i just try and imagine what an even  better work it could have become had it been a full band effort|1
berlioz remains an intriguing composer and this work shows all his assets to best advantage his reworking of historical and contemporary influences more than a few echoes of beethoven and queen mab is simply mendelssohn on a laudanum trip as well as his courageous visions of the future theres protowagner here and protomahler the ominous brass progressions disrupting the capulet festivities are positively ivesian and you dont even need much fantasy to perceive a glimpse of philip glass at the end of juliettes cortegravege add to all that some rhythmic complexities of the stravinskian kind plus the redblooded emotional fervour so characteristic of berlioz and you have a work that will not easily have you bored it may be melodramatic and over the top at times but its never less than fascinating this recording of it was greeted with great critical acclaim on its appearance i heard it at the time and was sorely disappointed a recent second try didnt change that im afraid though the booklet mentions nothing of the kind this recording was clearly made at a public concert the coughing starts almost before the music and returns persistently every ten bars or so for at least 20 minutes then the audience seems to slowly overcome its afflictions and attention shifts to the podium where players noisily turn their pages chairs form a percussion section of their own and sir colin leisurely hums along with the music and there are still more blessings of live recording to be savoured the sound of the vienna philharmonic on an off day for instance the ensemble is sloppy beyond belief at times violas lazily out of sync with first violins pizzicati so randomly timed that they occasionally become almost indistinguishable from all the background noise as at the end of the invocation intonation is equally approximate  if you didnt know you would never guess that these sounds came from such a venerable source the best part of the recording probably are the voices both choral and solo though the small chorus provides some disappointingly rough edges to le ciel at the end of the strophes in general the singing is incisive well articulated and powerful where needed technically the recording is very opaque a great deal of orchestral detail goes unnoticed turning the wonderful scegravene damour into a unhealthily mushy affair the sound has no bloom it is either vague and distanced making it doubly vulnerable to external noise or it is strident and fierceive never understood the logic of live recordings from any other than an economical perspective the excitement of being at a real performance can by definition not be reproduced on disc and it is that thrill of the moment that makes you put up with noisy neighbours or weird acoustics because your seat is in the wrong corner of the hall extraneous intrusions have no place on a cd on repeated hearing you start to experience them as part of the score ive come to expect a loud bravo on the final chord of the hungarian march from berlioz faust simply because a single enthusiast could not contain himself during gardiners live recording of that work and the editors didnt bother to cut his contribution out the great thing about cd is that it does offer the possibility of hearing a pristine rendering of a score adding in precision and sound quality even objectivity whatever it may possibly loose in heat of the moment excitement  although in my experience there are rather a lot of studio recording that lack nothing at all in the way of inspiration and musical fervour so i will be looking for a good studio recording of berlioz dramatic symphony and if you are interested in the work i strongly suggest you do the same|0
movie masterpieces by david glen hatch is a fantastic piece of work this cd will truly amaze you as to how such beautiful melodies can be transformed into music that is even more incredible and gorgeous each track will leave you yearning for more and wishing that you could capture the amazing feeling that you feel and keep it inside of you forever the album opens with the magical over the moon and flying theme which sets a mystical mood for the rest of the cd some of my favorite tracks include theme from beauty and the beast theme from schindlers list my heart will go on liz on top of the world and when you wish upon a star theme from beauty and the beast has always been one of my favorite disney songs and i love the way that hatch takes the magic from disney and magnifies that magical quality that was already there theme from schindlers list is one of my favorite pieces in this album because of the great amount of emotion that hatch shows through his amazing talent hatch clearly did an amazing job putting together this album it is one that anyone would enjoy no matter what their interests are|1
1 soldiers of sunrise  the beginning the sound was poorly mastered and cliched to death with elements of helloween and iron maiden but the songs was awesome a very good first step andreacute matos seems to be with 10 or 12 years but hes 14 in this his voice are only a bit poor because of the mastering but after all this is an excellent heavy metal classic that deserves attention2 theatre of fate  wow a step miles ahead this is truly the bands masterpiece the only one in fact the songs are a mix of heavy metal and classic music with a touch of originality their very best record and a truly must have for any melodic heavy metal fanthen andreacute matos leaves the band in disagreement with their sound direction and goes to angra where he gets famous and do the job that viper could have done pit passarel plays bass and sings from now on3 evolution  not a masterpiece but the sound is average some kind of metallica from the 80s more thrash than melodic with pure heavy metal with some fine songs and some weak songs the album is only acceptable but theres a huge problem pit have an annoying voice and that is one of the reason that disgraces every other bands record4 vipera sapiens  this is in fact an ep a minialbum i have to tell you its worse than any worse song from the third album its heavy and thrash metal but the songs are poorly arrangedand finnaly we gets on this one5 maniacs in japan  i never saw a so weak show before i get this one pit passarel is a complete joke live he tries to raise the audience but his english is terrible he tries to show some charisma but he plays the fool he tries to sing andreacutes songs but fails miserably destroying their own classics this show was a terrible mistake the band never was a very good live one but this is a complete disgrace they completely destroyed their own history but wait theres moreafter that the band made their two big mistakes in their whole history6 coma rage  this is the first one i can live without the melodic metal they once made i can listen to their thrash and pure metal things i dont mind but i cant afford this hardcore sound this is a terrible attempt to sound like bands like sex pistols ramones the clash with an extra heavy sound talking about the clash the only funny thing here is the clashs cover i fought the law the rest you can throw away by your window7 tem pra todo mundo  yes this is the second mistake the title says it have for everybody but they have nothing im not questioning the fact of the songs been written in portuguese i dont mind as im a brazilian its the songs itself theyre bad very bad its some kind of trying to sound like a jonny michel or legio urbana a brazilian band we had here the main singer and composer renato russo died in 1992 by aids getting together everything that was bad on the brazilian 80s rock scene im telling that because the brazilian rock is very rich but they opted to get the worst things nothing else to say bad attempt8 the best of viper everybody everybody  to complete ruin their own name they release this awful compilation that doesnt fit with a once great band they was and to disgrace even more they put only three songs of the andreacutes era two of them with andreacutes himself and the third one from the horrible presentation in japan couldnt be more awful than thatnow 8 years after all this the band is back on track and trying to get back to their heavy metal roots with a new guitar player val santos new drummer guilherme martins and new singer ricardo bocci that reminds a lot the andre matos voice they also have a new song on their temporary official site called do it all again that tries to recall the theatre of fate days their new album all my life is not bad its also a new attempt to heavy metal again back to their roots but its still far away from what they better produced in the beginningall in all if you want good viper albums get anyone of the 3 first ones or all my life but for gods sakes avoid any other album after that including maniacs in japan|0
its ironic that this is called beatles since it is more a bunch of solo performances with the other beatles used as a backup band remember when george martin suggested strings for yesterday and paul said as long as its not that montovani crap well the funny thing about it is there is some montovani crap on this record but it is on a lennon song this had to have been a jokeit always cracks me up when people disparage the solo mccartney stuff and then give this record rave reviews if you like novelty songs buy this cd otherwise borrow it and record the five or six good songs george martin is said to have pushed for this to be a single album he had it half right there are enough good songs on this to make one side of an album if you take the good songs from the pepper album and the good songs from this album you would have a fourstar albumbuy meet the beatles instead of this cd its much better|0
kerplunk came after 1039smoothed out slappy hours before green day hooked up w reprise records so its gonna be low quality  the vocals on some of the songs are goofy and unprofessional sounding best thing in town being an example cant even understand billie joe so i wouldnt recommend buying it get a bootleg or download it cause this is low quality neglecfully put together stuff|0
i waited awhile before writing a review because a lot of good things need time to absorb before you can really begin to appreciate them  my initial thoughts on this album were the same as many i suspect  where is the old rush sound  why am i not hearing songs that sound like limelight or spirit of radio  simple answer this is 2012 and its clockwork angels  its not 1981 and moving pictures  like a lot of people i had become a creature of habit and music listening was no exception  i would listen to the same albums over and over from the golden era of rush 1976  1981 i dont think many would argue with that and each time a new album came out i would inevitably start comparing it to the work from this period to see if it stacked up  eventually it occurred to me that if i wanted to hear songs that had the old rush flavor i would have to listen to those albums specifically and stop trying to look for it in the newer material  this is a band that thinks and challenges and looks for different ways to write and play  if you insist that a band make the same album over and over again go listen to acdcthat said this is a very good album and has a lot going for it  even though there may be no instantly memorable riffs or hooks in this collection the playing is very tight and the musicianship always shines through  the guitar and drum work is solid and there are some killer bass lines on more than a few tracks  ive read some reviews that complain about fuzzy or distorted sounds on the mix and frankly i dont know what theyre talking about  it may not be the crystal clear perfect sound that moving pictures achieved but its certainly not the muddled recording that signals was either  along with all the good ill objectively admit there are several things i dont particularly like  for one the strange echo effect that geddy uses on portions of his vocals during several tracks as if hes talking through a computer or something  its an effect thats been utilized multiple times on their last few albums and i dont really understand or care for it  fortunately its kept to a minimum and although i wish it were gone entirely there is something missing that i wish would come back entirely  alex lifesons great guitar solos  he does pull off a few decent ones on a couple of tracks but the man is way too talented and has written too many great solos to go cold turkey on the subject  he may never reach the peaks of la villa freewill or analog kid again but i still want to see him attempt the climbin the end all the positives far outweigh any negatives and clockwork angels is definitely worth the money to buy and time to listen  unless you were a gomer and downloaded or heard the whole thing for free online in which case its just worth the time to listen to  i just hope another five years doesnt elapse before another album is released albeit with more solos and less echoes|1
love the songs my children grew up listening to in car and now grandchildren listen too just never get tired of his voice or accent or the way he sings the songs thx for offering|1
great album  in fact best in years great work musically especially with the bass and drums much edgier then snakes and arrows cant miss if you are a rush fan|1
lets face it if youre a rush fan you had your hands on this album shortly after it was released  in terms of how well it is accepted into an already monumental body of work i think the group set the bar themselves with the clock cover 2112 it is thenthis album is frightening  it gets in your head as a friend of mine said  personally i havent had such a visceral response to an album in a long time  certainly not from a rush album sincewell since i first heard 2112  neil pearts lyrics have always been exceptional but for clockwork angels he has sharpened his tone and reduced his messages to their simplest and most elegant terms  the lyrics are poignant and direct and carry wisdom that is sometimes not easy to accept all wrapped in a story from a world of steampunk inspiration  geddy lee and alex lifeson provide the perfect musical vehicle for their friend to tell the tale with music that demonstrates their absolute mastery of music skills  almost jubilantly the music weaves the many styles from their past into new forms that are somehow as grand and majestic as the angels told in the storyafter many years wherever mr peart went to seek solace during his arduous times he seems to have found something or it may be that something has followed him back  clockwork angels is as bold in its imagery as it is brutally honest in its wisdom and the message is custom made for each and every one of us  once you allow the album to completely sink in one finds rushs musical delivery of the story and the underlying messages from a man who has truly seen the dark to be almost blinding|1
the wall was the second best floydian album after the dark side of the moon and contained fantastic songs like comfortably numb and another brick in the wall very highly recommended|1
rush displays the youthful exuberance shown in 2112 with the release of clockwork angels they pour themselves out  its as if they dont have a loyal fan base and have something to prove i have such tremendous respect for guys at this stage in their career to be able to be on the cutting edge please buy this album  show the band your support with your |1
since i cannot possibly outdo the existing commentaries on the songs of this album i will simply say that the whole album is amazing and tells an interesting story cant wait for the novel to come out in septemberi saw rush play during the timemachine tour two years ago and they played both caravan and bu2b cant wait to see them again this tour|1
this was one of the first pink floyd albums i purchased and it remais today one of my least favorites  it lacks the experimentation of the early albums and the orchestrations 70s albums  many consider it an extension of the wall but i think of it as a series of lesser outtakes from the recording of that landmark album  where the wall was cohesive and flowed along relatively well this album has a neurotic depressvie vibe to it that makes it hard to penetrate  i know many floyd fans out there will cringe but i prefer a momentary lapse or reason and the division bell to the final cut  mind you those postwaters albums are not great either by any means not compared to their 70s classics but at least i can sit through them  waters relentless rants make it difficult to listen to the whole of the final cut with the exception of keeps your fithy hands and two suns|0
i wont bore you with what everyone else has said and there are some great commentaries here but what i can add is that from the first moment i heard this album i know this concert is going to be loud  i saw the time machine tour last year plus many many others dating back to exit stage left at the hammersmith in london  ouch and besides being awesome it was loud  this tour is going to blow the doors off anything before i can feel it and i cant hardly waitthis album is amazing in that as full of sound the whole mix is each instrument is crystal clear rock on and blasting forward  and yet the whole thing together is an amazing symphony of texture fillling full every frequency range your speakers can put out  just beautiful  and damn these guys can still jam  better than ever its almost like watching them reach a new pinnacle of rock exactness precision sound surround perfectionsee you all at the next show|1
rostropovichs performance is very good but i havent particularly liked the 14th my favourite comparing this recording to the other two i own bernstein with the ny philarmonic and haitink with the concertgebouw  this last has lyrics in each poems original language which i like better i found the performance subpar it seems the orchestra is not performing cohesively during some piano passagesalso it is a shame or should i say a sham that not all the cds are sold individually i tried to buy the series onebyone across 3 countries us brazil and chile and havent found symphony no 7 so far|0
i know that sir collin davis deserves much credit for his good work in championing the music of sibeliusthe seven symphonies are wonderful and still generally underappreciated workshowever i couldnt help but find this recording a bit ponderous and dulltempi are slow articulation is flabby and there is a general lack of passion and energy that this music requiresthe recordings of paavo berglund with the helsinki philharmonic are really beautiful and would be i believe a much better introduction to this music|0
this album is only a few days old i dont think thats enough time to understand the whole thing so people giving it a five like me arent being very honest at the moment i think we all know its potential and complexity that it will lead to a 5  but i will be honest and give it a 35 right now but i will give it a 5 because i dont feel like coming back and changing this review to a 5 in a few months  i did that with vapor trails|1
i have been a wall fan almost my whole life  i grew up watching the movie  now i finally own the cd  at first i made the mistake of purchasing the out of phase ripoff version that is sold with the pink floyd name on it  beware of that version because its not floyd  fortunately for me the cd store let me exchange for the real one and i am just loving it  dont be set back by the high price tag  theres a reason an album thats been out for twenty years still sells for 35|1

this cd is a discrace to the name pink floyd it was definatly a laps of reason that made david think he should keep the pink floyd name after roger  left it is interesting to note that the best song on the cd  learning to fly required the help of three others whom we have never  heard from before the dogs of war is truly the worst song that lives in my  cd collection it is a truly horrabl pece with no floydianism in it what  so ever istramintaly aside from the dogs of war it is somewhat good but  all the songs do sound a little to much alike it just lacks the passion  that pink floyd had with roger waters plus davids lyrics dont contain  that aspect that alows you to relate to them and click  truly speaking i  can not consider this to be a pink floyd albulm when it lacks so much of  what pink floyd is like it or not roger waters was pink floyd the rest  of the members were members of roger waters band under the name pink  floyd david stole that name and has discraced it its close to working  but it just dosent quiet make it|0

not much to say really the music speaks for itself  the music is incredible the lyrics through the tracks remind me a bit of voltaires book candide  this album is for men and women who want complexity and thought in music|1
this is an absolute waste of studio time here folks the record shop was playing this horrible cover version by ginuwine and it was terrible to say the least generally artists try to improve or add to a remake or cover but this is just flat dry and overall empty what possessed him to try and tamper with a classic by prince you cant immitate a classic folks if you cant handle the heat of the classic best leave it alone or stay outta the kitchen  zero stars here nice photo though|0

canadian progressive rock masters rushs newest and 20th studio album clockwork angels is a must ownfollowing the superb 2007 album snakes and arrows album and its offshoot tour which came out as a live album and subsequently dvd in 2008 canadas preeminent progressive hard rock trio rush singerbass player geddy lee guitarist alex lifeson and drummerlyricist neil peart took some time off to recharge the batteries through 2009 and also neil peart became a proud father again in 2009 to daughter olivia his first child with current wife carrie nuttal and sort of closure on the heartache and trauma that he went through in the late 1990s then the band got to work on clockwork angels in spring 2010 and the first inklings of the clockwork angels album were the two great rockers caravan and bu2b which came out as a download only single and limited run 45 and limited run cd single then the members of rush took a break from recording to embark on the time machine tour which the band premiered these two new killer rockers and also play the moving pictures album live and basically honor the bands longevity and also giving glimpses into the future for what rush would unleash once the time machine tour would end also the bands documentary film beyond the lighted stage came out as well once the time machine tour and offshoot live dvd and cd was taken care of and finished rush plus producer nick raskulinecz and engineer richard chycki got together to finish recording clockwork angels if i thought snakes and arrows was a great album this album tops itwe kick off with the aforementioned caravan which is about travel and moving and here it is remixed than what appeared as a single in 2010 next is the also aforementioned bu2b aka brought up to believe this time featuring an acoustic intro which sets the mood before rocking out and this too was remixed for clockwork angels the song is just rocking next is the title cut which speaks about one flying through time space life over cities and people and the freedom to simply go and soar higher and higher this epic is another great rocker neils drumming starts the anarchist which is preceded by the pedular 1 is another brilliant straightforward rocker of a song with brilliant lyrics carnies is next and is a rocker about falling into the magical secretive world of the carnival with its deceptive lights and demon music and gypsy queens halo effect begins with an excellent acoustic guitar riff which then goes into a mid tempo rocker which is almost a love song in tempo but is lyrically far from itthen the second half kicks off with seven cities of gold which begins with a stellar neil and geddy interplay before alexs guitar lets loose for another brilliant rocker then we have the wreckers which almost sounds like a cross between u2 and warning by green day but a nice breather from the heavy rock this album has given us so far next is the albums first proper single headlong flight which is an over sevenminute monster of a rocker this track was lyrically inspired by neils late drum teacher the late freddie grubers e to neil before his passing of i had a great life and id love to do it all again we then have the pedular 2 which then gives way to bu2b2 aka brought up to believe too which is a reprise of sorts of its older brother but affective next is the beautiful and affective mid tempo rocker wish them well which lyrically states that there are better places to go be people to see and know jobs to take and a positive song we close with the best album closer rush has ever made the garden this seven minute epic is basically rushs way of saying hey its okay to dream and to forget the negatives hope is there and forever waits for the right person to take flight again the orchestrations here are haunting and one of my favorite alex lifeson guitar solos the solos on this album has alex playing with a fire not seen since signals in my viewon a sad note in addition to neil pearts drum teacher freddie gruber passing away the bands longtime personal photographer andrew macnaughtan also passed away just exactly two days after taking the photo of the band that appears on the inner digipak sleeve on this cd and strangely enough his death happened to be on the day after my birthday this album is dedicated to the memories of both gruber and macnaughtanalso hugh symes artwork alludes to rushs classic 1976 masterwork 2112 with the clock stationed at 2112clockwork angels is rushs best album since signals in my view and i say buy it nowrecommended|1
i remember that when i bought this album i thoughtwell maybe its not as bad as everyone sayshow wrong i wasi also bought it because im a pink floyd fanatic and i manage to find the best in everything they dooh but not thisthis album is not worthy of the name pink floyd it isnt even worthy of being mentioned in the pink floyd discographyi managed to get over rogers so called magnum opus the wallhell i even managed to like itbut this not thisi dont understand how could anyone manage to get over crap like the final cut ecpecially pink floyd fans who should really know betterdavid gilmour i said to roger if these songs werent good enough for the wall why are they good enough now we had the most awful time of my life roger had got rick out nick wasnt around much and now he was starting on mea most unpleasant and humiliating experiencei rest my case|0
i wonder if barenboim isnt being nearsighted as a wagner conductors someone who doesnt apparently care if his singres can comfortably sing their parts all that has ever mattered to him is getting his ring cycle on to cd along with everything else in the wagner canonthis tristan is typical of the results to be heard elsewhere wayward conducting excellent sound great orchestral work and embarrassing if earnest singing jerusalem and meier both noted soloists are so overparted here it isnt even funny but then so are all the singers in every single barenboim wagner opera with few exceptions what a waste|0
the wall should have been a better albumbefore you click angrily on the disagree button let me explain my logic  despite the walls depth unity of vision and interesting plot and freudian subtext there is something missing in the majority of the songs  that something is musicalitymuch of disc 1 side 1 and 2 for the original record is tough to listen to  the melodies are sparse the atmosphere thick and much of it frequently grating  try listening to dont leave me now more than once in a row without going ballistic  its as if when the teacher in another brick in the wall pt 2 is shouting how can you have your pudding if you dont eat your meat roger waters is yelling at us to choke down the meat of these tough songs to get to the pudding later to be had  waters even had something of a captive audience when the album was originally released as there was no skip button on record players  listeners were forced to wade through the discordance to find the melodiesthose melodies have a tendency to show up much more frequently in the second disc when we get songs like comfortably numb with its soaring guitar solos and vibrant chorus  the album becomes much more interesting in general after pinks wall has been built if not because of the greater musicality shown in the song i just mentioned as well as hey you nobody home and run like hell then in terms of storyit is worthwhile to note here that the wall is an extraordinarily depressing and pessimistic work  even on songs that sound somewhat upbeat comfortably numb mother the schizophrenia of the lyrics ensures that this is not the case  the pink floyd that is the main character of this rock opera suffers long and hard at the hands of  well everyone in his life especially himself  the paranoia anger and insanity that makes up this albums core is strong and pronounced in every piece of the album which accounts for another reason it is so difficult to listen tothe last reason is the sheer cheesiness of some of the songs  theres pretentiousness bleeding out of the albums climax the trial which isnt helped by the fact that it has the pomposity of real not rock opera  some of this music is some of the most pretentious this side of heavy metal and you can practically hear spinal tap knockingwhat saves this is the story the same story that i previously mentioned as being depressing and pessimistic  it is but its also wellthought out and very interesting albeit unclear without additional information such as liner notes or the movie adaptationoverall the wall is a stunning work but not quite the magnum opus dark side of the moon was  its still worth listening to for those with patience and an ability to see past musical shortcomings to the lyrics and meaning underneath|1
this cd is a little over an hour but does not seem that long at all  the cd player effortlessly spun out 5 6 and 7 minute songs that pay homage to their past compositions without dwelling on themyou will hear moments from some classic songs and find new ones to appreciate throughout this album  during interviews the members of rush have said they are playing at their best and from this album  i would be hard pressed to disagreeyeah it is a concept album and as such does hang together as a suite of songs  but somehow it is done in such a way that the songs are also able to hang apart  this is something that the album side long compositions of their early career were unable to achievethere is a range of emotions on this cd from the wideeyed optomisim and youthful energy in caravan through the resigned wisdom of wish them well and everything in between  listening to it is just a great experiencei would offer one word of advice buy this on the cd and listen to it on some sort of home or car sound system  i have read some reviews complaining about muddiness or a lack of sonic clarity on the album  mp3s are just inferior to cds and this album with its deep bass notes and glistening highs will reveal that inferioritybuy the cd play it on a cd player and enjoy|1
slash  myles are freakin awesome this mp3 is the bomb diggity i belt out each and every song when i have it playing love love love|1
i was really excited to see a new album by slash and hoped it lived up to all the hype  it is a very good album and he hasnt lost his touch  i wish he had brought back some of the people he had on the first album or some new people and not just use the same vocalist who is still very good and i have no issue with  with that said this is one of the hardestrocking albums i have bought recently  if you really enjoy slashs work or hardrock in general definitely check out this album  you will not be disappointing|1

please ignore all the one star reviews on this page for this timeless classic of an albumyou would find it difficult to find a better album than this so buy this album nowvery highly recommended|1
what can i say about rush theyve always been my favorite band i must admit that ive listened to their music since i first heard hemispheres in high school after 1981 they changed their style up a bit and i did not particularly like where they went with it moving pictures was the last album i bought that they put out that said clockwork angels reminds me very much of the epic story telling rush used to do back in the day love this new album good to see that lee lifeson and the master of percussion mr neil peart can still rock it|1
how could one write a column on classic albums and not include pink floyd responsible for not only the wall but dark side of the moon animals and wish you were hereid have to be a complete moron to not write about pink floyd in classic cutsthe wall was released in 1979it was a concept album about the tortured life of a rock star named pink floyd along with the whos tommy the wall is one of the most popular concept albums of all time more people probably dropped acid to pink floyd than just about anybody this side of jimi hendrix but acid or not just about everybody loved this album it doesnt take a hot of acid to recognize the anthemic quality of another brick in the wall part 2 or the masterful songwriting of comfortably numbeveryone from guns n roses to kittie to tom morello of audioslave  rage against the machine and layne staley of alice in chains have performed songs from this album what would a rock station be without hey you another brick in the wall part 2 run like hell and comfortably numb its nice to be able to throw on an album and listen to it from start to finish something that was once commonplace but could be painful today these days its surprising to hear three good songs on a recordits sad really but the industry has changedits obviously less about substance and music and more about marketing and good looks chances are if pink floyd had formed even in the nineties they never would have been signedbut lucky for us it hasnt always been that wayso throw on the wall and enjoy all of those old memories but be careful those acid flashbacks are a doozy|1
i think this cd is better than his self titled one singer is less confusing all the songs are rockers no slow stuff and some of the best riffs hes done highly recommended|1
the wall is a masterpeice in many ways in terms of art and creativity there is few compilations that come close the wall is story of madness and insanity brought on by old memories and experiences which in simple terms causes the character in the wall to build a virtual wall between himself and the outside world the story takes you in and out of the very depths of darkness with the combination of amazing guitar work and well done vocals the problem with the wall however is that to really get the enjoyment the album has to offer you must listen to it more as one big peice of music which can be annoying at times the plot is also very hard to understand at first and its not a bad idea to watch the movie as well as listen to the album to understand it but even so it still has its grand moments like comfortably numb mother and hey you|1
i bought this for my sister as a gift i knew it was a great recording because i own it my siter enjoyed receiving this and is very happy with it|1
this is a very funny man a very entertaining cd what is especially nice is that it is clean funny a good thing for the whole family to listen to on a car trip i highly recommend it|1
i was very disappointed in this cd other than the first track every song was to electrical piano for my tasteif this is what you like buy it however it definetly was not mine|0
lets get this out of the way right up front this is one of the very few standup cds i have heard that is fit to stand besides bill cosbys classic wonderfulness album or the national lampoon radio hour cd compilation i purchased this after a regan performance that i saw on comedy central left me in hysterics this cd did not disappoint regans take on school alone is worth the price of the cd his material is clean with only a few mild oaths damn hell doing clean material is much more difficult i have far more respect for someone like regan that does stuff like this than for those that aim low adults are not that much different than children you can convulse any group of preschoolers by shouting toilet it only takes different words for grownups regan shows considerable skill not only in his material but in the care with which he crafts each bit this cd has an unusually high number of really hilarious routines even the few misses are interesting and the good stuff is beyond praise if this doesnt make you laugh out loud then something is wrong with you|1
i want to strongly advise against anybody purchasing this shoddily mastered box office recordings cd of song of norway the score is beautiful but this cd makes all of the singing voices sound like mush decca broadway the real owners of the masters of the original recording will be making a remastered cd of song of norway which is scheduled to be released in the fall of 2003 please be patient and wait for the remaster dont even think about getting this cd|0
the wall is the greatest album of all time naysayers must look at the facts excellent lyrics and instrumentals a good story and some of the greatest songs off all time my personal favorites are empty spaces and the trial  i hope you agreealso check out the other albums from pink floydthe greatest band of all time they are also very goodps  it is supposed to be sad and depressing|1
i love the soundtrack to braveheart  the stirring sound of the the great highland bagpipes the discerning use of traditional scottish themes in the music the authenticity of the instrumentation  wait that isnt the soundtrack to braveheart thats irish pipes were hearing  uilleann pipes theyre called  and they are strongly characteristic of irish traditional music not scottishtheres nothing in the music that evokes the highlands of scotland did james horner ever travel to scotland to feel what the highlands are like did he listen to one note of scottish music to feel the history and spirit of the sound i cant imagine that he didwhat we get with this movie are the standard sweeping strings the horns for the fight scenes and the irish sound of uilleann pipes and the occasional flute to make sure were thinking irish not scottishthis would have worked better for an irish movie not one set in scotland|0
okay so for all you people thinking about buying this album you must buy the one with the digital booklet there is an introduction to each song in the digital booklet to really understand the album and the over arching theme of all the songs you must read the booklet and more importantly the introduction to each song which is presented in the digital booklet above the lyrics of the song it really connects the entire album the metaphorical glue that binds it together|1
rush continues to rock on another masterpiece cd from one of my favorite musical bands they never fail to satisfy the listener|1
the cd is awesome i cant wait for the tour  entire cd is worth the price i also purchased it on vinyl|1
i just didnt like the songs on the album i need to try another one of their albums that has songs that im more familiar with|0
christmas music you got to be kidding borrow this cd before you spend the money i am sorry i bought it big disappointment i will pass it along to someone i do not like very much as a preopened gift the samples provided on this web site do not allow one to hear a proper sampling someone with group must have written the high rating reviews|0
youve never experienced true music until you listen to this album every song gives dettils as to what could easily be considered the meaning life this is by far the best album released by pink floyd especially due to the fact that its so personal and is an autobiography of roger waters over all this is amoung the best albums to grace the rock and world|1
all of the reviews here speak for themselves  if you want to hear the most magical majestic and utterly beautiful christmas album ever produced pick this up  this music is entirely unlike mwss radiopop stuff it is instead almost entirely orchestralchoral in nature  the man really can compose smiths recording will warm up many a holiday season and bring chills to your spine|1
this was everything i could remember and a few i forgot by roger miller and although the recordings are really good they are not the single 45 versions i remember in most cases they are better recordings but just not the same|0
an excellent cd that captures the feeling of adoration that should be present during every christmas season very estimulating arrangements make of this album one of fresh celebration that you will cherish for years to come if youre looking for the obvious you wont find it here rudolph chestnuts let it snow  thank god but you will certainly be propelled into a reflective delectably worshipful time much like christmas should always be|1
matthew kelly is a wonderful motiviational speaker  this presentation is extremely uplifting and inspiring  i was very moved and glad to listen to his suggestions  great lecture|1
i am a rush fan but i dont give everything that they ever did 5 stars although everything that theyve ever done is at least above the bar of whatever the mainstream was at the time they started their careers with a heavily cream influenced debut threw in some new wave into moving pictures signals and grace under pressure some alternative in counterparts well you get the picture in every incarnation they always managed to maintain a certain degree of integrity and virtuosity in their musici am writing this review after two listens i listened the second time with headphones while reading the lyrics and i felt the way that i felt when i listened to moving pictures and 2112 for the first time i was drawn in and transfixed by the sound and the lyrical content in this case this album does not only rock it soars the band has been flirting with this sound since 1996s test for echo as a matter of fact the chromatic flourishes of caravan are reminiscent of the ones used in that albums title track the arpeggio in wish them well is also similar to the one used in carve away the stone also from test for echo there are other flourishes throughout that remind me of one song or another entre nous made a cameo in there somewhere and headlong flight is an evolved version of something that wouldve fit well on fly by night these are the calculations that i allude to with the title to this review there is enough here that is familiar to draw in longtime fans that complain that their rush dont sound like they used to when in fact theyve been revisiting their 70s sound on every album beginning with counterpartsthe allusions arent so obvious that they are annoying they merely add familiarity to the sound of this album here we have the band running on all 3 cylinders pardon the pun or rather as a v6 since test for echo neil peart has been writing from a much more cynical and mature point of view the song clockwork angels is thematically similar to freewill from permanent waves but where freewill is written from a brash inyourface rebellious stance clockwork angels is written from an experienced grown mans perspective on this album peart has distilled his ever more piercing views of society religion and just life in general and married those views to his personal tragedies that he endured after losing his wife and daughter you hear a lot of pain and anguish throughout the album and it is tempered with resolution and grace peart has never written more personally or honestly than on this album this is by far their best realized concept album and pearts best writing ever the album has the same heavy sound and bleak soundscapes that were the centerpiece of the previous album snakes and arrows there is however an added dimension of positivity and grandeur that was severely lacking in that albumafter listening 7 times i changed my review from 4 to 5 stars and i placed clockwork angels as their third best album of all time it is definitely the best concept piece theyve ever done and the songs are so complex that i completely understand why this would take 5 years to produce listen to this and then listen to permanent waves or moving pictures clockwork angels gives them a run for their money i only place clockwork angels third place behind moving pictures and permanent waves because those two are still more instantly accessible but clockwork angels rocks harder and the lyrics are more amazing than anything theyve ever done geddys singing has improved and his range has a new fuller quality that i hadnt heard before neil is playing more in the background but with every bit of mastery that he can muster alex shines throughout this album has the distinction of having the best ballad ever recorded by the band in the garden it is an epic ending to the concept of the album and closes things with a sort of magic that lingers spirit of radio anyone i think in time rush fans will look back and agree that this is one of their top three albumsthe story seems to be a metaphor for modern life i picture the boy of the story as a model of neil peart growing up the watchmaker is god and the clockwork angels are the stars and planets representing anything that humans have ever worshipped the anarchist is peart himself rebelling at consumerism blind faith and all the forces that pull us in different directions as he matures he realizes how many mistakes he makes the halo effect is about how we idealize things in the case of the story about how we idealize women carnies is about finding a life calling and pursuing it again alluding to pearts own decision to pursue show business seven cities of gold is about how money rules a large part of our lives and how we are always chasing it the wreckers is about the people that start wars and ruin things instead of building things that matter headlong flight is about the long journey that life is wish them well is about making amends with the people that make others lives miserable instead of enriching them and their own in the process the garden is the brilliant conclusion that our hero peart in disguise comes to when he realizes thatthe measure of a life is a measure of love and respectso hard to earn so easily burnedin the fullness of timea garden to nurture and protectin other words success isnt measured by what you achieve in life but rather by what people think of you while you live your life and what kind of garden you plant so truei would highly recommend this album to anyone that loves artrock progrock rush and cerebral music this might not be the best album to get to know rush for the first time since it is a dense concept album and that might offset some people i easily rank this in their top three albums and there is a lot to digest with repeated listensmy favorite rush albums follow in order from best to leastmoving picturespermanent wavesclockwork angelscounterparts2112the rest of their albums vary greatly in both style and quality they all have great moments but can all easily take 6th place hold your fire and presto are probably the worst of the bunch and are best saved for last if you want to explore this great band i would rank the rest of the albums as follows but this list changes often with my mood4 starsgrace under pressuresignalsroll the bonestest for echopower windows3 12 starsvapor trailsa farewell to

i had considered buying this soundtrack but my sister loaned her copy to me and im so glad i listed to it firstfirst of all celine dions version of the titanic theme here is not the same one on her album lets talk about love which is far better so if youre thinking of buying this soundtrack just for that song buy her album instead the song is not that great to begin withsecondly there is some atrocious bagpipe music at the end of the soundtrack that is truly annoying some of the earlier tracks sound like mrs nadaues 5th grade recorder class its not prettyi listened to the whole disc as i surfed the net and i thought it would be a solid 4 stars but then came dions version and then the bagpipesdown to 2 stars buddyi cant be so negative without suggesting some other movie music which i love try dances with wolves the mission the last of the mohicans or glory these are great records this titanic soundtrack sinks before it reaches greatness trust me|0
depending on your take on this epic masterpiece you can either walk away from it with a positive attitude or never be the same again it is a constant reminder of just how far the human mind will go before it cracks  this is without a doubt the bravest most raw in your face statement ever possible exception of plastic ono band this is  rogers lyrical masterpiece and in my opinion is often imitated but never  equaled the album contrary to popular belief is not hard to follow and  will keep you on edge until the final note warning this album is  incredibly opinionated and depressing you will hear things that may make  you cringe racisism rape drugs extreme violence and fascism are  abundant it is of course part fiction part nonfiction but the real  scare of the album is trying to decipher which is true and what is made up  everyone in their own little way has experienced their own personal wall  remember your inside hate and anger and fear that is what is openly  expressed here sheer brilliance|1
originally drawn in by seeing the music video for im so sick i had to check this band out  i live breathe and sleep music flyleafs debut immediately went into heavy rotationlaceys vocals are infectious pleasantly different and commanding united with a rarely seen energy and passion  jared and sameer are creatively raw talented guitarists that truly bring powerful elements to this band which is subtly accompanied by a phenemonal bassist in pat seals  unfortunately his talent seems a little quieted on the album  however when seen live his talents are well showcased  all this set against a backdrop of methodical stickslappin provided by the gifted hands of one james culpepperthe lyrics in this album are something i truly hope no one over looks  vivid courageous and selfexamining they are beautifully set into songs  if you are christian then most of the songs lyrics will allow you to enjoy flyleaf on another levelthis is an amazing band whos debut album both affirms flyleafs deserved place in music and promises bigger and better to come|1
more or less a cheesy compilation that my guess is that this cd was not released with twinks approval too many lamesounding covers jimi hendrixs red house j j cales youngblood santanas oye come va big joe turners kansas city the stones midnight rambler among others really nice cover though unless youre like a total twink  pink fairies  pretty things completist you just might want to avoid this disc altogether|0
became a fan as a kid over 25 years ago and this is honestly the first time i felt a new rush album matched their previous best moving pictures and power windowshold your fire had some great moments but overall it was sterile and didnt have enough jammingpresto continued the more mellow trend which worked better with its more acoustic feel  unfortunately the cheesy vocal arrangements ruined some otherwise fun musicabout half of roll the bones was excellent the songs had a certain catchiness that really clickedcounterparts saw them finally return to their edgier sound with a mostly strong album  but once again bad lyrics and vocal arrangements dragged down a couple songsthat problem was magnified on test for echo which was a let down though it had a few noteworthy tracks  its a shame because theres some wonderful guitars on this recordvapor trails stepped up the song writing again but the lack of spontaneity and solos from lifeson the dreary overall feel and the horrible production kept it from standing up to their classicsthen we got snakes and arrows and you could tell there was a spark  though a few songs were weaker it was rushs first album without an outright bad track in over 20 years  still i felt it was a shame that more songs didnt have the energy of malignant narcissism and far crywith clockwork angels i got my wish  it has everything i look for in a rush album amazing and energetic drum fills and patterns soaring technical and catchy guitar solos and riffs intricate and aggressive bass lines melodic but not awkward singalong vocals and indepth writing and leadrhythm interplay all tied together with a thematic story thats pearts lyrical masterpieceit combines the best of rushs new sound streamlined groove and old sound edgy mathrock jammingthe title track and headlong flight are as good as it gets while bu2b and the anarchist go toe to toe with rushs classics  carnies and caravan are also fantastic  just those six songs together are already longer than all of permanent wavesthe wreckers is incredibly catchy and bu2b2 is a nifty little orchestra piece  counting those two songs brings it up to over 43 minutesrushs pretty songs dont often come off but the garden does its one of rushs best ballads  counting it brings it up to over 50 minutesseven cities of gold is next with a very cool bass intro and odd overall feel  it doesnt quite click but its an interesting tune  counting it brings it up to over 57 minutesthe bottom two songs wish them well and halo effect are still worthwhile though theyre nothing special  still even without them we have an album thats over 20 minutes longer than all of permanent wavesclockwork angles is enjoyable startfinish but more to the point is that it has over 37 minutes of exceptional songs and over 43 minutes of very strong songs  i never thought rush would put out another masterpiece but they have  buy this album|1
this fabulous cd is worth every penny i am an amateur collector of irish fiddle tunes in this jampacked collection i am haunted by the tunes and riffs that lay down a legacy for contemporary musicians i can nearly see the bowing of the generations that played in the 1930s commenting on their own legacies from their masters in the late 1800s and as a kurt vonnegut character would sayso it goes|1
i am fortunate to  hear jimmy sing at sunday worship he is a wonderful christian musician father husband and friend|1
i wish id never clapped ears on the white album it certainly didnt capture my imagination i rushed to buy it when it first came out i expected so much of it id hungered for it for so long two years since sgtpepper like a junky awaiting a fix i was splitting up with my girlfriend at the time maybe that had something to do with the way i heard it id loved the beatles previous three albums rubber soul revolver  sgtpepper each one had progressed and built on the previous one each one was full of colour and flowing melody songs which hung together and complimented one another true albums which gave you hope for the futurethe overall sound on the white album is to my ears no longer threedimensionally colourful but twodimensional grainy grey it sounds like all the outtakes from the previous three albums were gathered together and stuck on one double albumin short  the songs are crap i suppose i could pick out about four songs i like ussr blues helter onion and sadie tie for forth revolution 1 was done better on the single richer sound and revolution 9 sounds like someone tuning a radio the rest are twee novelty songs except for two which ill come to laterive got a theory that there are two kinds of beatles fans who dig the white album the younger ones who came to the fabs after theyd done their best stuff most of these fans would have been under 15 when they heard the lp and musos who played in bands themselves because there are more instrumental solos than is usual for the beatles on this onethere are only two great songs on the album happiness is a warm gun and julia both written and sung by john lennon i think the first dynamically vast with wonderful imagery the second yearningly hypnotically melodic both intimate both unlike anything that had been written before to conclude the doublealbum would have made a great single  as in 45rpm single|0
the beginning of the end for the beatles  for a rock and roll band the beatles almost completely abandoned the genre for this outing  replete with indian influences sitars and the like this album marked the beginning of the downward spiral the beatles would be on until their overdue breakup at decades end  lennon himself called this the pot album and he couldnt have described it better  the beatles were always at their best as rock and rollers and this album along with every album they recorded after this one were weird studiotrickery albums with songs that byandlarge couldnt be duplicated on stage thus the band stopped touring locked themselves in abby road studios and for the next four long years overindulged in pot and hallucinogens and proceeded to record the effect these chemicals had on them  how they continued to sell ill never know  they had abandoned their fans for dope  if you want a sampling of what the beatles were truly capable of any album they released through help would do  they are particularly strong when handling covers like twist  shout rock  roll music roll over beethoven long tall sally and the list goes on  lennon mccartney and harrison also had their fair share of selfpenned rockers between 1963 and 1965 but were never again to record a true rock and roll post 1965help  for further insight compare the hardrockin 1963 version of one afer 909 that appears on the first anthology with the more familiar version on the let it be album  what a difference and not a good one  the let it be version is like the band tired bored and due for a rest  early beatles 63  65 are your best bet|0
what does one say in way of introduction to what is perhaps one of the finest and most popular albums in rock music from the time of its original release this album has been acclaimed as the most outrageous and most penetrating of the concept works ever released i remember living in london in the 1980s and seeing the movie version of this at the time it premiered and being flabbergasted at the artful way in which the animators interpreted this mindboggling take on britain after world war twoit is a most amazing concept piece and a study in the ways in which individuals feel crushed isolated and left bereft of hope by the indifference cruelty and intolerance of a modern industrial society it is not so much a collection of individual songs as it is a thought piece that reverberates on a number levels of the artists consciousness examining his innermost thoughts hopes fears and experiences it takes place in a surrealistic landscape one that evolves as quickly as the changes in perspective shift and flow buy the cd listen to it endlessly and then go rent the video and watch it it is a most provocative entertainment and a strange and emotional whirlwind ride through the orbits of an artists innermost ruminations enjoy|1
this is an incredible album i am glad to see it available again it truly captures the many aspects of the sea in musical form it is not the typical sound of crashing waves on the shore in fact there arent any wave sounds on the whole album but full compositions that reveal the true depth and majesty of the sea my favorite track is 2 her consort the sun you can feel the union of sea and sun as two lovers who join as one as the sun meets the sea at the horizon  separated as the sun continues its travel through the sky  only to be joined again when a new day begins hauntingly beautiful  truly gives me chills every time i hear it|1
i have been turned off by their recent offerings but i must say that this is possibly their best recording since counterpartsi have been a fan since 1976 and have seen rush countless times since 1979ive been through their highs and lows and have always been a fanclockwork angels is closer to their roots than previous efforts and rocks hard both with raw intensity and melodic prowessi highly recommend this album|1
this is the worst beatles album i have ever heardthe disc lacks any bass and some songs do noyt even sound like the beatles the whole disc is poorly recorded old beatles songs with manly lyrics and highs but no lows or much midrangei have a good system with good cables and powercordsthis might be the worst recorded disc that i own by any artist|0
a cellist by training anton fils 17331760 emerged as one the most innovative composers from the mannheim school born in eichstatt germany he studied law before joining the famed orchestra in 1754 in next six years he is credited with at least 34 symphonies and about 30 concertos primarily for cello and flutewritten in c major the 1st symphonys allegro molto exploits the dynamic contrasts typical of mannheim slow building crescendos that suddenly drop to pianissimo as well as bursts of bold unison phrases all over hushed urgency in the upper strings a stately andante makes use of extended triplets while the minuett features the punch of horns shifting into minor for the contrasting trio a haunting oboe solo stands out the brisk triple metered presto develops from the opening rising arpeggio through the brilliant flurries of violins to a rousing conclusionflutes offer a gentle counterpoint to the ferocious strings in the 1st movement allegro of the e flat symphony the upper winds continue their featured prominence in the genial andante that follows horns drive the triple metered minuett which is punctuated by an unexpected emphasis on the 2nd beat while the flutes take center stage in the trio a furious presto ends the work with joyous gustowhether by fils design or by a publishers editorial decision the only symphony he wrote in a minor key the g minor contains only 3 movements foreshadowing the sturm und drang style soon to explored by haydn mozart and others the 1st movement allegro opens with energetic strings presenting jagged thematic material while horns supply sustained pedal notes a delicate andante offers a welcome respite from the vigorous outer movements engaging pianissimo passges alternate with stirring unison phrases in the final allegro assaiwhile the 4th symphony is composed in d major frequent shifts into minor color the opening allegro but the following andante is firmly anchored in d minor as with other slow movements an unobtrusive keyboard supports the strings in this case a harpsichord supplies a finely filigreed underpinning bringing the movement to a somber closelighthearted gaiety arrives with the minuett while a playful flute provides the centerpiece for the contrasting trio from the muted beginning of the 4th movement which features only the upper strings fils builds the the final allegro by layering in successive instruments until the recapitulation surprisingly he then gives the flutes the lead melody previously carried by the violins before the final ending flourishalthough written before the existence of the widely popular sinfonie concertante the symphony in a major assigns such prolonged solos to the paired flutes as to be a forerunner of the genre working from long crescendos with the full orchestra the 1st movement allegro features extended passages highlighting the soprano winds a discreet pianoforte supports the following andante while the courtly minuett again spotlights the flutes during the rustic tinged trio hushed and frenetic a triple metered prestissimo closes the disc in a burst of luminous joythe recording by cpo is excellent sharp and clear while lorfeo baroque orchestra is terrific led by violinist michi gaigg the chamber group attacks the outer movements with fierce precision and bright sparkle while giving the slower inner movements deep expression had he lived beyond his tragically short 26 years anton fils might have given us a body of work to rival any of his more famous contemporaries|1
let me tell you one thing jazz and russian music just dont mix very well the motives of the person who decided to record these crude jazzy versions of old russian songs with drunken live choir in the background will forever be beyond me overall the whole cd sounds like soviet 60s popmusicin any case if you want jazz stick with american masters if you want old russian melodies by all means avoid this cd|0
i drove cross country with a friend and we cried laughing to this disc three times before we noticed that there were no obscenities nor sexual references i enjoy chris rock and dennis miller but brian does not rely on  any gimmicks for a cheap laugh this disc is as good as all the reviews  say|1
upon listening to some of these samples i realize now how embarassingly introverted and unrewarding this album always was while the wall ultimately succeeded in projecting the narcissism of the jaded rock and roller into a phantasmagoria of paranoid selfdelusion here the listener is forced to identify with roger waters intimate and outlandish self pity and absurd free association of ideas jesus was crucified and guilty me i watched too much tv whispered in carefully phrased pseudoironic fashion over dull funereal orchestral moanings while the title cut recalls comfortably numb musically its dramatic recollection invention of a nearsuicide by waters comes accross less as an inspired moment than as a cynical attempt to force the listener once and for all to identify wholly the classic pink floyd sound with his navelgazing or else|0
i must say that brian is one of the best comedians in the business  he is sorely overlooked in the industry and deserves more attention  i only wish there were more regan albums i could buy  excellent|1
this was one of the most important albums of my younger years while not every song on this cd is great the over all content is out standing comfortbly numb is by far the best trak although some odvious crazy people will say britney is better because she sold a few more cds how ever i seriously dubt that we will be listing to her in 20 years let alone 10 yearsa great cd by one of rocks greatest bands there is a reson this album still sells more then 20 years laterupdate wow look at little britney now how far she has fallen seems like her new cd is not selling so well funny how history has a way of putting thing right|1
marienthal gets stuck on musical theory draining most of the selections of emotional content  flashy scales and changes do not enhance the recording they simply distract from the essence of the music  perhaps an interesting piece for students of theory but the essence of jazz is not evident|0
i should give 5 stars as this edition is nicely made with all stuff accessoires that came with the original lp back in the sixties lets russia show to the western record companies how to present a cd album properly and thats the way it is i give only 1 star as this album is offered as japanese and many people do believe its japanese because it looks so japanese the serial of this tojp 708081 on obi strip is japanese but for vinyl lps only the japanese never had tojp letters for cd editions tojp was only used for vinyl lps they do have tocp like the white album edition real japanese released from emi 19981123 with serial numbers tocp6520001 and a complete different designed obi strip|0
although i dont listen to this one as much as the other floyd discs anymore this is definately worthy of the praise its been getting if you dont own this album yet then you can not consider yourself a serious music fan period|1
like many others have said this score is superb but this cast does a foul job of it  most voices maintain tolerable but the actress who plays mary brings tears of pain to the eyes of the listener  perhaps she was trying to make her character more brazen if so she failed miserably  if you are to come across the actress who played mary please do the world a service and rip out her larynx|0

ill admit when it comes to christmas albums i prefer the oldiesrat pack ella fitzgerald the carpenters there is a simple joy and spirit about the way those tracks but they are timeless and are the perfect accompaniment to any christmas party or gathering based upon impressions i had with tso being synonymous with christmas i sought out this album and am glad i sampled it before purchasing it honestly i wouldnt subject myself or any others to this album unless i wanted to end a christmas party that was going on a little too long it is the vocals that absolutely ruin any semblance of christmas spirit and enjoyment this album might otherwise have i dont know the history of this group but the vocals  sung mostly by a man  seem fit for a heavy rockpunk album they are harsh sharp loud and pounding qualities im not looking for in my christmas albums clearly this style has a market but if you like your christmas classics light and jovial stay far far away if you remove the vocals  which i was not expecting when i started listening to the tracks  your left with some pleasant orchestral arrangements and a few enjoyable alternative rock arrangements but as is this just doesnt say christmas to me at all|0
the twist and the associated music is bad  i bought the album just because the song shout  that is played at weddings today was originally a peppermint lounge song by joey dee  young people now dont believe that so i bought the album to prove that i was rightjohn permantier|0
i bought this cd a couple years ago and rue the day that i spent the money on it  the music sounds like that played at a 2nd rate circus from the 50s or that in a beer hall  if you like this type of cheezy music then by all means get it  otherwise look for another russian music cd|0
guess what  if you sit around all day long thinking to yourself self i sure do wish roy clark will remake his old hits again then your dream has came true  every song here is a remake professionally done but a remake none the lessto me i never was a big fan of these songs in the first place they were more novelty type songs even when he tried to be serious he always sounded like a gimmick type actbut what is here remakes are done professionaly and i guess roy clarks true fans will love it  but if you are a completist like me you would rather have the original recordings which these are notand something else dont take the picture of clark on the back of the cd playing the guitar make you think there are guitar sounding songs  all the songs here are done in the vegas type sound clark is famous for|0
i was introduced to the burns sisters music a couple of years ago at carbondale il when they were on the city of new orleans tour with arlo guthrie i was hooked immediately i got this album and keep it in the car all the time  not just the christmas season i liked their rendition of children go where i send thee but i was blown away by this christmasi have gifted several of my friends with this wonderful cd|1
maybe its because i heard caravan and bu2b on the tour already that the opening tracks grabbed me so immediately but i doubt it since from the first listen live those tracks just rocked  i wondered aloud at the this is their first concept album chatterafter all they did several concept sides fountain of lamneth 2112 hemispheres  while i cant point to a super memorable riff ala spirit of radio limelight freewill or even digital man the songs are all strong  would love to see this performed start to finish in concertsomething i havent said about a rush album in a really really long time|1
the sound quality is awful they sound like they are singing softly at the far end of a long tunnel and it varies from song to song and singer to singer they must have used only one microphone on stage wish i had returned immediately i never listen to it ever and it is one of my favourite operas|0
once roger waters left pink floyd there was simply no reason for the band to carry on other than the money that is  guitarist david gilmour as he showed previously on two decent but hardly vital solo albums is a good  singer and a fine guitaristbut only a mediocre songwriter  waterss  vision is missed by his former bandmates in so many ways that it is  difficult to fathom  for example give a listen to the turgid dogs  of war and compare it to anything on the masterpiece album  animals  enough said|0
i highly recommend this cdespecially 2 anyone who loves classical rock music its a little dark but edge the guitar on most of the songs sounds excellent|1
its rush so its amazing as usual  love the tunes love the artwork love the band  its also nice having the digital copies available on amazon immediately after purchasing|1
myles kennedys vocals are beautifully haunting and when theyre mixed with slashs guitar style the experience is golden music doesnt get much better|1
i actually traded my copy of the vintage beechamreiner tristan with an alabama gentleman in exchange for this after hearing this i think i got the lesser end of the dealms meier makes an unusual isolde i have not decided if she is really a soprano who also has nice rounded bottom end or a mezzosoprano who can reach the high notes either way her isolde is not to my taste i acknowledge her intelligent wordpointing and innate musicianship but ultimately she lacks the vocal radiance and incandescence of the great isoldes on record just hear her liebestod and realize how much more effective it would sound with a proper soprano voice in this ecstatic music a proper isolde will give the impression of a soul soaring impassionedly into a spiritual union with her tristan instead the low tones and lack of brightness in meiers mezzo makes this poor isolde very earthboundthe rest of the cast is adequate jerusalem especially i have not been a fan of barenboims conducting forays particularly his csoerato efforts here i will withhold the vitrol and just say that he makes a competent accompanist for the singers here but in no way does he rival the great recorded conductors command of wagners score not furtwangler not karajan not bohm not bernstein not beechamreiner and certainly not kleiber either one only has to listen to the incessant presence of the brass in this barenboim to realize his lack for care for orchestral balance this brassy balance makes the stringplaying sound tinny and insignificantin summary this is a tristan you can overlook if you plan to have only one great tristan recording in your collection the alternatives to this barenboim are far more desirable|0
this soundtrack to the awesome film just doesnt feel right  watch the movie and enjoy nino rotas score in all its glory|0
its difficult to think of an album that still holds its audiences transfixed more than twenty years after its initial release  with most bands producing albums consisting of nothing more than a collection of  singles a single song is the image conjured in the mind when a bands name  is mentioned  pink floyd however managed to carve themselves a niche in  the wall of rock music not once but twice the dark side of the  moon being the other occasion by producing concept albums with a  central idea or thread flowing throughout both sides of the record  the  floyd took this one step further in the wall however  bestowing characters and a plot melding them seamlessly with music and  effects and crafting without a doubt an album which is the pinnacle of  creative musical expression  as with all great art the wall  reveals reasoning behind human turmoil madness and angst  it poses  questions and provides many layers for the listener to dig through deeper  and deeper with each listening until finally reaching the point of  complete understanding  for all of my searching no other album ive found  has done that  if you do not have this album purchase it close the  doors turn off the phone play the cd and read the lyrics  do yourself a  favor  this is one of the few albums that is about something and if  you listen carefully youll find out what|1
i dont care what any reviewer has to say this album is great in the words of ferris bueler it is so choice if you have the means i highly suggest you pick one up|1
with a perfect balance of melodic and progressive hard rock sounds the belton tx outfit flyleaf have produced an excellent album  frontwoman lacey mosleys voice can sound angelic at times but then quickly evolve into a choppy barking rasp  guitarists sameer bhattacharya and jared hartmann provide a stable and driving backdrop for mosleys vocals and shine in their own right  the bottom end is heavily handled by drummer james culpepper and bassist pat seals  driving rockers such as im so sick perfect and the bold cassie highlight the album but dont count out flyleafs more melodic tunes such as so i thought all around me and the excellent red samfans of groups like evanescence pillar and disciple would be doing themselves a disservice by not checking out flyleaf  in my opinion they are a very maturesounding act considering their youthful age  if you enjoy positive prog rock or straightahead hard rock flyleafs selftitled rocker is a definite purchase|1
what more do they have to do  as if all of the hits and albums arent enough now they add to that yet another strong release that projects the energy and creativity of a much younger band  to say theyve been overlooked is a gross understatementrush finds the zone on clockwork angels concentrating most on heavy grooveladen hard rock riffs underscored by a thumping bass line  of course it wouldnt quite be rush if you didnt also get ambitious adventurous compositions and passages in the mixthese tracks offer those elements in abundance but never stray too far from the basic strengths that have made rush one of rocks most enduring acts  while several songs like the title track and the garden are quite dynamic and display the wide range of abilities typical of a band with the skill set of rush the foundation still rocks solidly throughoutthe title track is a great example of this  mellow balladry early on quickly gives way to heavy basshappy progrock then a catchy melodic chorus  they start over and run through the cycle a bit faster then move into some nice soloing by alex over geddys pounding bass  next is a journey through some almost trippy verses before the song finishes with the chorus and one last blast of heavy guitaryoull also find most of these qualities in varying arrangements on the albums other notably strong tracks caravan bu2b carnies seven cities of gold and headlong flight  my personal favorite is seven cities of gold an epic track featuring one of the albums best riffs brilliant jazzy bass work and guitar solos and a fantastic chorus this ones an instant classic for meand geddy lees vocals sound incredible  his clean clear nuanced melodic singing complements the music as it always has but i personally think his voice has become more resonant as hes gotten olderrush hasnt lost a step  in my opinion and the rock  roll hall of fame loses more credibility every year that it keeps out bands like them  whether they get voted in or not doesnt really matter because people who know anything about music know that rush is a legitimate legendary rock act and this new album just adds more polish to their stellar career|1
if somebody knows why these kind of recordes are been realesed i would like to know first the sound is very bad designed and mixed phill did it himself and thats the reason why it sound like a bunch of demoes some of the songs need more work and you can not escape of imagening  what could have happen if la guns put their hands of these stuff with a good producer as they did on vicious circle the album is full with ballads and based on drumsbassguitar and little keyboards and really save your cash for a better produce album from this tallented guy|0

it seems the general consensus on christmas music is that its fun to hear at the start of the season but quickly becomes an annoyance towards the end of it the main complaint being how many times can you hear the same song preformed by different artists it is a rare occasion when an entire album of christmas music can not only be a refreshing and welcome alternative to endless clones of holiday songs but inspires listeners to play it beyond the christmas season michael w smiths christmas  album does just thata star of the contemporary christian music scene smith has managed to blindside those familiar with his hooky choruses and average lyrical content with stunning arrangements of glistening musicianship beautiful vocalization and lyrical poetry indeed the album does feature renditions of perennial favorites like o come all ye faithful and silent night but these versions sound as new and fresh as the day they were first performed the real treats are the original selections such as the luminescent first snowfall and breathtaking no eye had seen all the songs culminate to gloria which is clearly the albums definitive moment and the one song that will be repeated endlesslythere is no denying the one element that makes this christmas collection stand out from all the others joy from the beginning strains of ronn huffs brilliant orchestrations to the simple yet heartrendering finale smith has tapped into a fountain of joy that will continue to make listeners thirst for morewith christmas smith has found the perfect mixture of musical and lyrical content along with his two previous studio efforts the big picture and i 2 eye christmas rounds out a musical period that for smith can arguably be called his finest|1
my kids ages 5 3 and 3 love this cd  it has really catchy tunes that are easy for them to sing plus its educational  asking them to identify colors fruits and veggies in the market etc  i think the main reason that my kids love this music is that there are kids singing it in addition to frank leading it  great cd for preschool and early elementary aged kids|1
this album sounds like a continuation of all the parts of the wall i didnt like bring the boys back home vera lynn etc with the tv sounds effects and people shouting  ok for a movie score or multimedia masterpeice like the wall but without the good songs in there to hold it together it just falls apartthis deserves its reputation as the worst postbarrett pink floyd album|0
upon first hearing flyleaf on the radio i was liked them so much i stopped at my local store and picked up the cd their hit song im so sick had me hooked i had no idea they were a christian band i just know that i liked the way their music soundedflyleaf is a metal band that has a lead singer who is a woman i love the way she sounds if she is screaming it never sounds to stressed she can also sing in a very gentle voice it all depends on the songalthough this is a christian band do not avoid it if you dont like that type of music most of the songs are more based along the lines of revisiting past problems and not pushing religion onto you i honestly prefer it this waythe songs im so sick and breathe today are my favorites but none of the other songs are bad some of the songs feel a little bit like filler songs you can live with it though since you get mostly good music throughout the rest of the cd|1
i liked this cd but i like the movie captain ron and many of the songs are similar|1
a word of warning not all the records have the issues that were present on the us version of the dsotm issue fixed see reviews ironically i have a dsotm reissue and it sounds perfect my copy of wywh however sounds terrible scratches pops and background noise are present throughout the entire disc most noticeable on the first side i have an old original copy from my dad and it only sounds slightly worse on one side and better on the second i got it as a christmas present so im not even sure who to complain to and try to get a correctedclean disc if anyone knows the proper channel to issue a formal complaint through it would be greatly appreciatedits especially frustrating because you can tell the remastered version sounds amazing but it is impossible to ignore all the extra noise|0
there will be no doubt that the band you hear is rush and that they still rockthe wellcomposed songs revisit familiar riffs as well as bring in new tricks including a backing symphony how oldschool is that  each member demonstrates their continued unquestioned mastery of his instrument  neil is creatively relentless on drums geddys bass rumbles throughout the tracks and emits the distinctive katwang when he goes to the high strings and alex precisely hits every note on various guitars either pyrotechnic electric or calmer acoustic  the accompanying booklet is well done explaining the story behind each song with a paragraph of text artwork and full lyrics  the sound postproduction could have been better turn up your treble some for better results but the slightly muddled pileup of sound is not a major detractor considering that the albums theme is of a frantic and confusing journey not a meditationthis disc belongs at or near the top of any rush collection|1
my wife and i purchased kim robertson  virgiinia krons celtic christmas about 15 years ago after hearing them in concert we have been playing this album ever since and it is still one of our all time favorite albums its just good relaxing music  timeless|1
i have been a rush fan for some time now but kind of lost my way for a few years not that the music was bad but not something i would look to listen to when it was on i did not turn it off but also didnt give it much thought this music is different in the way that they seem to be bringing back that side of the band that plays their own instruments distinctively the bass is strong guitars are being played in front of the music not just in the back ground and of course the drums are kicken give it a try if you like any rush at all you will not be dissapointed and maybe pleasantly surprised|1
easily on the face the physical tonality of janacek goes far without much complaining about limited range his compositions are amply wide for any string orchestra and certainly diverse enough in their conception so within the first 10 minutes of this cd youll find yourself more engrossed with the sound engineering and with what pople is trying to do with janacek rather than enjoying janacek soon enough the realization solidifies that any capable string quartet could give this recording quite a bit of challenge wheres the contrabass did they pick up a paycheck for just showing up and occasionally pulsing along with the orchestra to verify this assumption all you need to do is listen to track 12 the beginning of the suite for string orchestra their bowing is embarrassing as if the policemen who reply to your urgent 911 call come dressed in lilac unitards and only armed with nerf wifflerbatsbang the gong and move on|0
i didnt like it because i was not aware that it wasnt the soundtrack from the movie i was very disappointed|0

putting musical experience into words is impossiblehowever i felt compelled to write a review of this amazing album  my first rush experience came to me when i was 9 years old when i received my first sony walkman remember those and a cassette remember those of rush signals  when those first heavy synth chords hit my ears it propelled me into a musical journey with this band that has been going strong for over three decades nownow im 40 listening to clockwork angels with my 9  5 year old boys and were all rocking together with this band that just keeps getting better with timei titled my review the protectors of music because to me thats what this band has always been  in a world of such disposable insignificant musicrush puts together a masterpiece that is just light years ahead of everything else  the sound of clockwork angels is aggressive hypnotic melodic and at times apocalyptic  its an emotionally charged collection of tunes that will leave your head spinning and wanting another thousand listens  and if youre not welling up by the end of the garden you are not humanas a musician i am in awe of this band and always have been  they are just beyond comparecant wait to see them this falli hope they play the entire album  thank you alex geddy  neil for protecting the music and making it matter|1
i bought both cds level one and level two it starts and goes completely through with a guy just talking in lakota there is no english at all and nothing to look at or refer to i was really hoping to learn lakota but just listening to a foreign language with nothing to learn the language from is nearly impossible if you just want to hear the language spoken this might be for you i am greatful amazon caries something such as this but as isit is pretty useless|0
for all you syd loving waters hating retro closed minded people you are ignorant pink floyd made their best music with waters at the helm not syd yes i have listened to piper blah blah the wall like many others have said is a concept album  dont expect to pick this up and have a radio single for every track  even though there are a few comfortably numb hey you another brick in the wall pt2  it is best listened to straight through as you probably already know anyone who appreciates music should have this in their collection|1
i was infatuated with hayley when i was 13 and this was one of the first albums i ever bought i found it a bit weird at the time with its mix of classic numbers side by side 30s style throwbacks jeepers creepers sentimental sunday rocknroll ding ding ding and cute  cranberry bog jimmie bean song lets get together was great however but all are characterised by hayleys total inability to sing a phrase in one breath hold a tune or inject any sort of personality into the music the arrangements are ghastly ive toyed with the idea of buying it for old times sake but basically its unlistenable you can share her pain if youre brave enough to shell out for it|0
he is so funny  i just wish he made the dvd so you could see him as well as listen  he is even pretty clean only a few 4 letter words even the kids can listen to him  any they enjoy it too  a must have|1
by this time pink floyd were starting too reach the breakup and this was pretty much there last great albumthe final cut was really just a roger waters solo album rick wright was already out of the band at this time but they still mannaged too make a rock opera the wall is a story of about a rockstar named pink the first disc shows his humble begginings but by track 9 hes grown into the pink we know by disc two hes pretty much gone insane and in the movie his sink is filled with blood and he cuts himself but the main song out of this album is comftarbly numb about when he overdoses on drugs all in all this album is timeless and is for every pink floyd fan alive new or oldbuy today|1
they produced this masterpiece great from start to finish it took me back to the moving pictures days of listening to an album from start to finish and loving every second of it also saw them in concert when they rolled through austin last year and it was a fabulous show dare i admit i had tears in my eyes at some points i mean really who cries when they hear the opening chords of the analog kid i do thats who geez i really love rush|1
nice to hear the songs revived but in my opinion this artist sounds like another broadway voice  but not merman very nice voice but without merms salty brooklyn tones her humour and trumpetlike purity of projection just a note if youre going to imitate merman the word ever is pronounced evaaaaah|0
phantom of the opera is not an easy thing to perform so over the years it has been repeatedly minced by untrained singers and musicians now i dont mean to be rude but if i wanted to hear something like this i would listen to a parade marching band its pretty bland and the vocal talent as it is referred to  might as well be singing  domo origato because thats what it sounds like unless you are tone deaf ignore this|0
some blues can get really depressing and melancholy but not luther  he gets a groove going that will make you wanna dance 1237 more or he plays slower empathetic blues jams that place him on par with the greats 456 more  luthers guitar style is solid but not intrusive he was muddy waters guitarist for 7 years so he knows how to blend  shades of buddy guy muddy waters and all three kingsi think this is one of the most underappreciated blues cds there is  a desert island disc  luther is the real deal  find out why|1

i bought this cd for the girlboy song i heard on the radio  i found that song to be very novel and quite marvelous at the time for its marriage of breakbeat electronica with classical string instrumentation  the production on it is not the best though  you cant up the bass to listen to the breakbeats with any force without having the orchestral bass strings overpoweringlythumbing out too buzzylike  well this song lost its gloss pretty quickly for me  i think its an interesting electronic novelty song now  i have since sold this ep to the resale shop the rest of this cd sounded like an attempt to be a sort of electro version of they might be giants  mildly amusing at times for the most part mr james didnt seem to hit the mark  i agree these short tunes with his whimsically innocent vocals do sound like scraps of sillyness he dug out from bits of crumpled paper perhaps lying around his floor  probably an ep for fans only but not essential for me|0
unquestionably one of the most creative and masterfull albums in rock history  a storytelling masterpiece|1

david is a fine composer hes written some very lovely new age music this is his attempt to jump onto the celtic bandwagon and it fails miserably dirty linen magazine tore this album to shreds it barely registers as celtic theres no fire here no spirit its like the disney version of what celtic music should be david should stick to his etherial compositions and leave the celtic music to those people who make a living at playing celtic music this is an insult to musicians who spend years learning the nuances of irishscottish music|0

according to geological records the earths magnetic pole switches about every 60 million years  the last such swap was about 65 million years ago  about the same time as the last massive dinosaur dieout  the earth is 5 million years overdue the story revolves around a group of scientists and doctors  jordan and jillian are physicians with the cdcp who work under dr landerly david is a geologist and becky is a biologist  each of them start noticing things around the same time  jordan and jillian notice that people are slipping into comas after being hit by what appears to be some sort of stomach flu and not waking up david finds evidence of a magnetic reversal being responsible for the dieout of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago and further evidence hinting that the same thing has happened about every 60 million years and becky finds a small area in the tennessee backwoods with a large number of mutated frogs  there doesnt seem to be any connection until the four coincidentally meet up and pool their resources  what they discover is terrifying  the world is due for another magnetic reversal and it appears to be startingsome reviewers have mentioned that they found the beginning slow and the ending abrupt  i found the beginning to be fascinating as each group makes their discoveries and tries to figure out what is happening  the middle i found incredibly confusing  there is some really weird stuff going on and nobody seems to understand what is happening  but it is all explained so dont let the weirdness scare you off  the idea scudiere comes up with is both fascinating and really scary but at the same time incredibly nifty  the ending was a bit abrupt  there is no real discussion about the overall effects of the magnetic reversal upon technology for instance  it seems to me that the magnetic upheaval would have wreaked havoc upon computer systems and networks as well as the guidance systems and so forth but this isnt mentioned and once the actual snap occurs everything is business as usual  nonetheless i found it a very enjoyable read and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good biomedical scifi thriller  check it out|1

resonance by aj scudierethis is a  book that delves into the medical and social issues surrounding the reverse of the earths magnetic polaritythis could be described as a medical mystery or science fiction  it incorporates facets of both genres  the two main characters jordon and jillian are mismatched lovers in the making  lots of sexual tension surrounds their relationship while both remain oblivious to the obvious  they are cdc doctors tasked with discovering why some very strange deaths are occurringtheir interaction with a self centered geologist a biologist and some wranglers provide a wide variety of character interaction  this was an intriguing mystery which did become a tad confusing in some places  i suspect if you like robin cook or michael crichton you will like this booki recommend the book|1
i bought this cd for barbers agnus dei and unfortunately thats the only track i really like  all the others are too weird and out there for me  guess im just oldfashioned  |0
let me first start by saying i love james horner really he is a true genius  while this soundtrack really worked well with the movie it was not a great listen as a stand alone cd  i now know why it was so cheap save your money and buy something else by james horner this is probably the only soundtrack by horner that i did not adore|0
ive been a fan of rush for over 30 yrs  my first memories of them are an older friend talking about 212 then another buddy whos uncle played in a band from canada bringing in permanent waves when we were in high school  i was in kind of an inbetween stage musically  i love kiss but didnt care for the poppy direction they were heading in  i loved all of the classic bands of the time but when i heard rush i was blown away  i was a budding drummer just starting to play in some bands and when i heard neil peart i thought ive got a lot of work to do  id never have the nerve to put myself in neils class but about the new albumi absolutely love it  i bought the 2 tunes in 10 that were released on itunes and got sick of them a bit from playing them so much  but hearing how they work with the rest of the album im not sick of them any more  they are a bit different on the album too  rush is still my favorite band i have everything of theirscds dvds bluraysi hope to see them on this tour as ive never seen them live|1
the final studio album by the comsat angels was also their longest one this reissue makes it even longer adding seven tracks that werent on the original release and expanding the album to two discs its easier now to understand what the band was trying to do at the time  the glamour is kind of like the comsat angels version of mellon collie and the infinite sadness half harsh guitarrock and half dreamy ballads also with a few long and meandering compositions the problem i think is that it isnt similar enough in some sense to the smashing pumpkins opusmost noticeably the production is very unflattering if the glamour had had the benefit of a good nineties production like mellon collie did it might have made a much better impression but the album jacket says produced by no one and it sounds like it even in the loudest rockers the guitars and drums sound weak and thin they never attain that muscular energetic sound that all the best rock songs have instead it sounds kind of like they took the mannered restrained guitar style associated with their early work and tried to use it to play hard rock the songs strain to be rough and noisy but never quite succeedstephen fellows voice also sounds weak and straining which is odd since he was in good form on my minds eye maybe its because of the production again if his voice sounded deep and dramatic like on sleep no more or calm and reflective like on my minds eye it would have greatly improved many of these songs but he really doesnt sound that confident here and even when the music sounds kind of interesting his delivery tends to mismatch its tone the one time he tries to sound calm and collected in i hear a new world its actually quite effectivebut its not just the production in fact the loud rockers just arent that strong to begin with i thought my minds eye used a few generic altrock templates but the glamour uses nothing else the songs repeat basic rhythms but none of them has the kind of sharp concise riff that characterized the best nineties altrock like the smashing pumpkins zero instead they just go for speed or volume which doesnt really work since theyre still not that fast or loud you cant say the band didnt try  they even replaced their original bassist with two new guys  but it seems that they were just out of good ideas at this point i almost wish they had tried to make a smashing pumpkinsstyle album with a harder production and greater emphasis on pop hooks and guitar riffs but the glamour is kind of neither here nor there sometimes they even repeat themselves  the riff in goddess is very similar to the one in my minds eyethe glamour doesnt have even one candidate for a good single which shows its weakness among comsat angels albums even their synthpop detour seven day weekend had at least two pop gems that rivaled any of their early singles and my minds eye had the superb field of tall flowers but here even the most ingratiating guitar songs have a strange plodding feelthe slow songs are better in fact the first disc has three good excursions into dreampop valley of the nile with a string section one of the few times they go beyond their usual compositional range sailor built on brooding restrained guitar strumming one of the few times the guitar takes on a good atmospheric sound and the niala game one of the previously unreleased songs with prominent bass and a faraway daydreaming tone in the vocals these songs still dont have any standout hooks or musical phrases but the mood is affecting any of them could be included into a hypothetical bestof disc to show off the bands more textured side but unfortunately three good slow songs dont quite make for a good twentysong double album especially not a double album that emphasizes loud guitars the other slow songs tend to repeat the ideas of these three  slayer of the real has a great title but the song itself is a fairly pedestrian vocalsandguitar balladthere are also two long songs over seven minutes both analogous to porcelina of the vast oceans by the smashing pumpkins if only they had been analogous to zero instead  a pretty slow section then a guitar freakout unfortunately the band still cant come up with an engaging guitar solo their strength always lay more in postpunk drone guitar so theres not much development in the songs and the soft and hard sections dont seem to be connected naturally sounding more like disparate demos that were arbitrarily spliced together other songs like breaker or pacific ocean blues have the same weird fragmented quality reminiscent of the bands very first album waiting for a miracle except drawn out to a longer running time and with more vague lyrics the lyrics by the way arent very impressive  it may just be that fellows cant bring them to life with his delivery but even the good songs get by on mood more than words or musici dont knowi enjoy a lot of the comsat angels music but aside from the three dreampop numbers on the first disc and a couple of other songs i dont really feel like listening to most of the glamour ever again if youre curious about their late work my minds eye is an excellent album i dont think the glamour would interest anyone but the most dedicated fans though|0
wow this album isnt theyre greatest album that honour falls to dark side of the moon but this album has everything  including a hidden message at the start of empty spaces  dont ask how i knowhighly reccomend this album to fans of alternative and prog rock|1
i do recall that when this album was released 1979 it sold like hotcakes  i also recall getting pretty sick of hearing the line we dont need no education from another brick in the wall pt ii on the radio not to mention seeing the anthem scribbled on walls and schoolbook covers  at any rate this was a huge album for the group and showed them adopting aspects of the then popular stadium rock styles  this was also the last album that featured the classic lineup  indeed this was very much rogers album and while conceptually dense i like the concepts presented on dark side of the moon 1973 betterthe lineup includes roger waters vocals bass guitar david gilmour electric and acoustic guitars vocals fretted and fretless bass guitar nick mason drums and percussion and the late rick wright organ piano synthesizers  while the musicianship is still pretty good this was not much of a group effort and the atmospherics that characterized some of their best pieces were pretty much out the doorthe music was very much influenced by roger and the melodies suffered because of it  indeed the music could be harsh at times and lyrically ugly  this was a very depressing album that principally served as a vehicle for roger to explore issues of a personal nature eg the death of his father during the war and an overbearing mother see nicholas schaffners book a saucerful of secrets for more details  even more depressing is the fact that the concept is cyclical  some of my favorite tunes on the album including comfortably numb were written by dave who also played a few of the most interesting bass lines on the album  including parts on a fretless introduction to hey you  unfortunately rick wright was barely present on the album and the lack of his contributions on keyboards is noticeable  as a side note the relationship between roger and rick was extremely strained at this point and roger went so far to take stabs at rick in the lyrics  eg i have a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains  in the box set compilation of live performances of the wall from 1980 you can hear rick pound out the piano parts when roger sings this line  the departure of rick from the group was announced later in 1982although not as cool as my old lp this remastered version is pretty good and features the lyrics and good sound qualityall in all while not my favorite pink floyd album the wall certainly has its moments and served to bail the band out financially  at the time they suffered massive financial loss following some bad investments  come to think of it i even went so far as to see the film version of the wall in the theater although i found it to be just as depressing as the album  for those folks that enjoyed the wall yet may be new to group you might want to check out meddle 1971 dark side of the moon 1973 the excellent wish you were here 1975 and animals 1977  the final cut 1983 was the last gasp for roger and continues in the vein of the wall|1
this album in my opinion is the worst of johns career  i bought it back around 1977 as i was just beginning to explore jazz and john coltrane  what a mistake  my roomate at the time a jock at a progressive radio station threatened me with grave bodily harm if i ever played it again in his presenceanyone who has actually listened to this album on purpose or by mistake will know why the manufacturer no longer offers this title in its catalog  likewise its not hard to understand why eric nisenson author of ascension john coltrane and his quest suggested that it was recorded while the entire band was tripping on lsd it truely falls in the weapon of mass destruction category|0
at least one third of these tracks contain music not from venezuela not that the interpretation is bad altogether and it does give you that latin ambiance but the title seems not quite fair and the typical and unique  venezuelan rhythm is not present other cheap cds out there give you much  more from genuine venezuelan music you may want to pass this one|0
this is a great cd  track 1 plays well all other tracks skip iplayed it in different cd players all the same|0
this is a kick arse album his best work yet guitar wise killer solos all the way through and a great mix of songs nn|1
they sent a cd from a different composer in a different genre with different performers somebody didnt bother to read the order|0
the followup to the wall the final cut is when considered with its predecessor a musical letdown its also without pink floyds keyboardest wright who was kicked out of the band at this timeive seen the limited video ep that accompanied this album and putting pictures to the music doesnt add to iti am a pink floyd fan meddle is my favourite album so i guess i prefer their earlier stuff|0
im not sure whether or not the recording is well done but none the less i have problems with his performance style  though his articulation is executed well he has somewhat of a hollow tone to his playing and the fact that he doesnt use vibrato much doesnt help him|0
amazing album dripping with melody and filled with terrific guitar workthe only thing better than the choruses are the verses|1
i find it hilarious that most people worship this as some kind of cult death metal release but its really some watereddowned happyclean death metal the vocals are boring and uncreative the guitar playing isnt very  aggressive  its sometimes boring the drums are about average id  rather hear my 7 yr old brother bang on something the whole egyptian  inspiration is sotryhard its not even funny im sure nile have little  fantasies about being rockstars look at all the attention theyre  getting these guys might as well go to mtv or start selling their cds  at walmartcmon people check no next to my review that would  make me feel quite wonderful i recommend this album to humanitarian  metalheads and trend lovers everywhere|0
the recordings are very good the song selection for the price is dissapointing i cannot recommend this cd versus other selections that offer more songs|0
does any of you stupid people know the true meaning behind this punk wannabe poppy group slappy hours is how long is singing about how long it takes for them to cut up women in several hours and being cannibals for 1039 hours|0
this is the same set as the disappointing american warner archives cd i have also reviewed three of bonus tracks  the drifter harpers selfpenned theres no time like today and burt  bacharach and hal davids me japanese boy  are lesser tunes  from their third and fourth albums amazon lists an additional bonus track  as small talk a cut i never heard of could it be a misprint  for the bands pleasant if syrupy version of rodgers and hammersteins  happy talk on harpers debut album there was a chance to  improve a bit on the original version and it wasnt taken at twice the  price this cd has less to offer than the american release|0
the songs are typical beat music in the 60s yes it was the time for beat music absolutely each song has two or three chords to play like i saw her standing there please please me twist and shout etcfor beatles fans only|0
hard to tell if the music i wanted from the movie would be on the soundtrackandit wasnt very bummed wish i could return the digital file somehow and get my money back |0
received this cd in a timely manner and exactly in the condition promised  weve been enjoying the cd in our car stereo  good road music|1
like most of the people who reviewed this cd i bought it thinking that it was the soundtrack songs like crystal methods keep hope alive and tricks she makes me wanna die but i was sorely mistaken so just as fair  warning if you want a soundtrack it doesnt exist go get the singles  this is the music from the fight scenes and such i give it two stars  because its only good for background music i find it impossible to put it  in a cd player and listen to it over headphones you absolutely cannot get  into it which is the case for most scores anyway|0
awesome deal music cd plus a dvd with the beautiful laseyher voice is amazing  great band|1
the first michael w smith album i ever heard was actually 2  though i agree that in general mwss music has steadily improved over the years and he was fantastic starting out project is definitely the best of his first three albums the other two being 2 and the big picturemy favorite songs on here are sonata in d major you need a savior and the race is on  the music is definitely dated  the album was released 21 years ago and the sounds are very 80sishimmortal classics on here include great is the lord and friends  the second of these two is one of the most wornout songs ever written  now i dont mean to offend but if youve sat through as many youth camps and graduation ceremonies weddings funerals etc as i have then you know what im talking aboutie i just want sniff to dedicate this song to all my senior friends who are graduating this yearmeanwhile the senior friends are sitting their thinking thank you lord that i wont have to hear this song anymore  its definitely the koombahyah of my generationnonetheless if the 80ssynthesizer sound doesnt turn you off this is a wonderful album to own and enjoy|1
since presto great guitar riffs powerful bass and drums no really weak song on clockwork angels my favorite songs the title song carnies headlong flight and the gardens|1
if you are a pink floyd lover this is an album to own and listen to often it is truly a masterpiece i never get tired to listening to it because it so well made and lyrics are so well written that in my opinion it will never get old no matter how often you listen to it it is truly a timeless piecei recommend to anybody who appreciate an artistic musical piece|1
this is for people who are interested in bach and would like to listen to selections of his work this is not for a lover of bach who wants hours of deep listening|0
loved the music heard about flyleaf through a friend and after a quick screening of the cd i got it for all those thristing for something more than this bubblegum rock thats out there check this cd out you will not be dissappointed|1
when i was in music school at stetson university the recordings of choice of gregorian chant were by the monks at solesmes i now teach a course called music of the worlds religions and when i came across this cd on amazon i jumped at the chance not only is it an outstanding performance of chant by some of the very best but on top of that you get a lecture about history and performance practice what more could a music history prof ask for this cd is well recorded easy to understand and the tracks are arranged so that one may pick a subject to demonstrate add to that a very reasonable price and there you have itan almost perfect cd for the occasion|1
i received the cd promptly and is appears in good shape but the remastering was botched not one song is clear guitars sound like banjos and the vocals sound gravelly didnt pay much and not worth much|0
this album is just simply awesome  they have improved so much over vapor trails and this is a continuing example on how to continue to put out new material|1
two stars not dissing the beach boys or their music just the way the album is set up the album is a 9track album with no liner notes sold at a cheap price if you want quantity pass on this if you dont care for big doses of the beach boys christmas music this may just be the album for you the beach boys christmas album is a better value with more music on it|0
i saw brian on comedy showcase a year ago and found him hilarious this cd is so great i highly suggest purchasing it if youve seen him perform live his facial expressions make it better but the cd is very worthwhile  because his vocal inflections crack me up thats all im tryin to  say thats all that im drivin at really if you think about it thats  all|1
was disappointed that it didnt include the mission impossible theme i heard at the end of the movie  good orchestral sequences but only for the classical at heart|0
this album is not one of chris deburghs greatest albums  if you are not  already a diehard chris deburgh fan try one of his other albums first  a  couple of the songs are pretty good including shadows and  lights and eastern wind  most of the rest of the songs  are soso though i do not like the record company bash at all|0
im a life long rush fan and clockwork angels continues to show that their music matures and evolves with me  its a fantastic listen|1
this is by far the most horrible record ive ever heard a thin voice and a thin production it might be something for die hard discofox and modern talking fans but i really doubt that all in all a very very thin cd|0
this floating light does not illuminate much area in a pool  perhaps in a small pool it does better  after trying it i was ready to toss it  but instead gave it to my son for his room|0
brian regan is hilarious  his humor is clean and creative  he finds the comedy in the everyday occurances of life  i recommend listening to him when you need a good laugh |1
i play these cds in the morning for my 3 year old son on the way to school and the songs put him in such a good mood they are great songs to sing along and act out like the duck quack quack song and sambalee he gets so excited he wants to sing it over and over again|1
after their two previous lackluster efforts i was really surprised about how bucking awesome this album was its a concept album but i unfortunately have never been good at following concept albums so i cant honestly comment on the narrativebut on a whole the album is amazing i dont see it working if you randomly get a track on party shuffle its meant to be listened to as a cohesive whole and by gum it worksthis review aint the longest in the world but take my word  clockwork angels is great i wouldnt say its better than grace under pressure or moving pictures my top two rush albums but it is an easy thirdedit i accidentally wrote signals not grace under pressure signals is still good though|1
i highly recommend this collection  the songs are fun and silly and smart all at the same time  kids love themand i as a mommy love them too  you cant help but smile and dance around and sing when its playing  makes a great baby shower gift  or birthday gift for children|1
it isnt that the music isnt goodit just isnt my style i took a chance to see if i might like it i am a traditionalist when it comes to christmas i will stick to bingperryand percy|0
got to find those german masters that emi didnt have their hands on from the usa at the timewith that flush true stereo sound theirs also a few in japan as well boy im starting to feel like the actor ben gazzara all of a sudden thats the way the beatles were made to soundor emi is syd right your employees living at that time it kind of makes you wonder why emi capital and a host of others not to produce an album to groups that didnt make the grade on a single then other labels i mean the side walk skipper band wow for the people not voting on me keep studying the quanity and price on your right will ya thats the used section ben from albums and cds stores coast to coast that gives you a sign of returning products right their maybe theirs a lot of you that were not born at that time when this music came out ha lots of bandwagons because you know why when this music came out back then it sounded  25 to 35 times better than whats on this cd big ps ive got the psychedelic colorized cover version of revolver album and not the one thats on the yahoo image thats been photo shopped not to many made and the song tomorrow never knows has the seagulls and guitars sound like their circling on the headphones and the album is not quadrophnoic either also theirs four extra songs on the album as well thats how far ill go with that so you figure that one out beatles fans a 119 lowest price so far|0
im not going to bother comparing this album to 2112 or moving pictures because thats not fair and im just happy that one of rocks best and most original bands is still making good music if youre not a rush fan this probably wont win you over but you are a rush fan just sit back slip on the headphones and listen to some of the most talented musicians that played rock|1
over the years i have come to appreciate rush much more than i did when they first appeared on the scene the last few releases clockwork angels included have been solid efforts that have only added to the bands legendary international stature a friend purchased this one the week of its release and loaned it to me after enjoying it several times himself i agree with his positive assessment and so a copy is in my cartthere have already been hundreds of reviews most of them favorable so all i can do is add my thumbs up to an already enormous amen corner when i first listened i mentally gave it four stars but with each listen i hear something new so ive bumped it up to five though i enjoy the entire album my favorite cuts are caravan the anarchist seven cities of gold and the wreckersthe cd is packaged in an attractive digipak and is accompanied by a fat booklet containing album info the lyrics and a number of cool images if you werent already a rush fan you probably wouldnt be reading this so what are you waiting for order it you cant go wrong|1
now about the albumthe wall is a smart portrayal of politics and current events taking place in the world at the time of its release roger waters the main writer of the wall coproduced an incredible concept of the story of an unhappy boy pink who grows up without a father goes to a school where teachers torment the students becomes a depressed rock star has a bad relationship with his wife and so onanother brick in the wall parts 1 happiest days of our lives 3 and 4 is one of the biggest hits on the album and tells about pinks school we dont need no education is from another brick in the wall in case youre wondering since it is a classic rock radio station favourite mother is a nice song which tells about pinks parents goodbye blue sky is also a nice song but pretty gloomy empty spacesyoung lust is my favorite song on the wall and is sung by david gilmour hey you and is there anybody out there are creepy songs that i like note cd2 is the best cd of the wall and has more complete songs than cd1 comfortably numb has a great guitar solo by david gilmour who cowrote the song run like hell is excellent waiting for the worms is creepy and finally the trial concludes everything in pinks life when everyone who made pinks life miserable and tormenting all come to pinks trial this songs lyrics are very crazyoverall the wall is one of pink floyds top 5 albums it is arguably not the best one thoughone con about the wall is that you cant select shuffle or random on your listening source because most tracks are not complete songs in other words most tracks converge into each other there is a way to help this though put the wall into your computer use certain types of music software and converge multiple tracks from the wall into a single track one thing you can do is combine another brick in the wall parts 1 2 and 3 and happiest days of our lives therefore creating another brick in the wall complete version this can go for all pink floyd albums you can even combine every track in progression on the dark side of the moon and make it as one file make one file with every song of the album on it in orderthe wall gets 5 stars and rightly so being the wellwritten complex and musicalgenius of an album it is i personally hope that whoever is reading this review buys the wall or already has it it is a very good album to owni hope you liked my reviewbottom line the wall a nearmasterpiece is an album that should be in every household especially if you are a rock enthusiast or pink floyd followertabucky|1
my children are now middle aged but this music reminds me of mostly happy days when they lovedthis musicthank you|0
i had to give this at least a few listens before i rushed into any judgment myselfi did like it on the first listen but with each additional listen i  am liking it more and more while i feel lyrics are important in a song for me its way more about the music i can relate to much of what neil relates to as far as the irony of how everything unfolds on this planet and how it could be so much better but folks can take this band and what neil thinks far from where it was intended to go all this horse dung about political correctness only depends on which side you feel you yourself fit into really now doesnt it i have been into rush from the time fly by night was released and have seen several tours through the years and its how well these guys play and interact as musicians that appeals the most to menot the individual politics of the band sure geddy has never been what some  people consider a real singer and constantly whine about that but he never claimed to be what some folks think he should be as a singer  but the guy is an amazing player of incredible ability as are the other two and how they all click is what i myself enjoy sure wish people could just enjoy the music and stop with the constant attempt to prove how their ideals are how everyone else should be or else there is something wrong with them there is everything herethey structure songs in a way only rush can and i am looking forward to more listens of clockwork angels as time goes by and whatever they do as a band is fine by methey have surely earned the right to do whatever they wantand always have which shows you how wonderful music can be without some kind of all wise management thinking they know best telling a band how they  should do things the pulse of a lot of people just doesnt fit into some ideal mold at all another thing this band has provedim with these guys until the endof whatever|1
ah yes this is the real stuff  a collection of traditional irish music recordings dating back to the 1920s and 30s with some later recordings up to the fifties with the current popularity of celtic music many traditional musicians are exploring the limits of traditional music adding unusual instruments and styles its not unusual to find a recording of a yiddish wedding song or a appalachian tune in the middle of an album of jigs and reels or the occasional jazzy or bluesy riff ornamenting a hornpipe these days im not saying this is a bad thing after all folk music is alive and constantly changing and traditional musicians are people to with wide interests and the curiosity to explore different genres however the range of influences available to todays musicians is much greater than that which was available to an older generation and the music is now in danger of losing its roots becoming a world music stewthis collection features many of the great old musicians who were influenced only by their neighbours and relatives and thus their music is rooted in time and place much more than the music of today these musicians  coleman gillespie murphy reavy and the others featured on this cd  were hugely influential themselves the 78s they recorded in america were sent back to ireland and influenced a new generation of musicians many of the combinations of tunes that are played today are lifted straight from the old recordingsbonnie kate is always combined with jennys chickens because thats how they appeared in michael colemans recording but this cd is no mere academic exercise in folklore it is sparkling bright lively full of energy earthy fun and the recordings are mostly excellent although one or two show their age with scratches and hiss  they were remastered from 78s after allthis is the cd to get if you want to here where all this irish traditional music comes from if you want to hear it in its original form and if you want to hear it as it really should be|1
my kids love the disney soundtracks but some of the otherslike beauty and the beast for instanceseparate the songs into groups with the first 10 songs being with vocals and the remaining being instrumental lets face itkids dont care about the songs with instrumentals my kids enjoy the first couple of songs on this soundtrack but quickly lose interest because they have to wait through 3 songs with instrumentals to get to the next one with vocalsshould be more kidfriendly|0
what a great radio series love hearing famous actors of the day playing unexpected roles this is true acting when and actor must use his voice and sound effects to create the image for you love listening to suspense while working on projects around the house on long car rides or late at night when i am in bed|1
female elvis is an insult to the male  real elvis this poppy white washed sound is nothing he ever came up with  not even in his vegas lounge act days i do not recommend this album at all and have actually deleted it from my player so it wont come up randomly|0
great old bands seem to at some point stop being able to write the kind of music that made them great maybe its because they have run out of good ideas or because they have changed musically or because some record company told them what will sell in the 90s i felt rush was starting to head down this road but at this point i have to say they definitely have recovereddespite being a concept album with a theme across all the songs the music is still pretty diverse parts of clockwork angels sound like they could be king crimson while elsewhere there are shades of yes and some other style i cant name but it makes me think california yet its still rush throughandthrough whether it sounds like old or new rush the comparisons to 2112 are apt in my opinion but with the newer style addedmusically this album is very complex with complicated rhythms in many places fantastic bass lines chord changes and everything else that makes for a good prog rock album theres no tom sawyer here but that just makes it all the betterthere are probably little things sonically that could bother people individually but i find it hard to say that theres anything annoying on a large scale i was going to put in a snarky comment about how listening to the mp3s on your ipod is not going to give you the full experience of the music but i will leave it at that nonsnarky version and just say i enjoy it best at a loud volume with real speakers where i can feel the music instead of just hearing it|1
having performed carmina burana with a large chorus i might have a little more experience with this piece than the average person who has only listened to recordings i found this particular version of carmina to be a little on the melodramatic side dont get me wrongcarmina is a dramatic piece but too much of a good thingjust isnt goodspecifically some of the slower solos were too drawn out the tempo needed some help too i felt like the entire recording was being dragged through molassesmaybe im just used to a certain soundi certainly agree that music appreciation is subject to each individuals interpretation but if you buy this cd and feel the same way as i do consider purchasing the eugen jochum directed version its sold on amazon for a few dollars cheaper than this recording and its sounds better|0
even after 30 plus years how a band could keep creating such collaborations is beyond me as a musician playing guitar bass keyboards and vocalist i can really appreciate the time it takes to put together one great song this band has done it time and time again for over thirty years the new album clockwork angels to me is a band revisiting the old but never resisting to push forward in their material and song plots this whole album tells a story worth listening to even without the most amazing music pushing it to geddy alex and neil  please keep this going there arent enough bands out today that havent been put through the clone stamp grinder that have achieved your statusbuy it listen to it and i think you will agree its rush and thats enough said|1
katsaris has an excellent technique but i believe he is becoming mad due to his popular demanding about he being a virtuosothe first sonata and the second are horrible speeding all the time and not respecting the instructions the music has  the third sonata is a better option but still not as it is|0
this album is at the core of my christmas music listening  it wouldnt seem like christmas to me without hearing this collection of great songs  i can listen to this album again and again and again|1
this is my favorite selection of rosalinds music each piece takes the listener to a different time and place if you are attentive you will become a time traveller and globe trotter|1
the book had me from the very beginning i like to read before bed and had a hard time putting it down to go to sleep the characters are likable and believable you want to see them succeed in the face of overwhelming odds the ending is intriguing and i would have gotten away with it if it werent for those meddling kids michelle with the promised final sentence to aj thanks for a great read|1
i am a big fan of carousel and consider it to be the best of the rodgers and hammerstein musicals next to showboat it is my favorite of all american musicals i bought this recording because i wanted to have one with uptodate soundthis recording is a total disappointment to me its almost impossible to do a bad job on if i loved you but theyve managed to botch it here and this is one of the best numbers in the show even i can sing it better than the male lead in this recording soliloquy which is one of the greatest showstoppers of any american musical comes off just as badly and why did they drop the highest judge at the end its not great but its not bad either maybe it was because its a demanding piece and the male lead couldnt handle itcarousel is deserving of a firstrate production along the lines of what emi did for showboat in the late 1980s sadly what is perhaps the greatest recording of carousel of all time has long been out of print in the early 1960s command issued an outstanding version with alfred drake and roberta peters i dont think it has ever been transferred to cd and given the fact that it was recorded with an experimental technology using a 35mm film base it may never be for those of you who still collect lps this is the one to look for|0
it will require me to listen to it at least 10 times before i declare that this is a great rush effort like every other rush cd that i own but right away the garden  just wow|1
im directing my review to rush fans alonerush is the only band i still buy the album of as supposed to downloading the tunes digitally  theres something about opening the cd and reading the booklet that only a fan does   when the singles came out caravan and bu2b and later headlong flight i was so excited  these three titles simply rocked  but the release of the full album wasnt the album i expected to the point i wished rush hadnt released the singles first  still seeing 2112 on the cover 912pm  2112 in military time was a blasttotally ignoring the progrock trios first full albumlength concept story for a second im still mulling over the story between the lyrics and neils added comments in the booklet songs stand good all on their own  my recommendation is to ignore the story for now and focus on the music  like any rush enterprise theres a lot of information to take in and this is just the first week  what was mediocre yesterday could be todays favorite  such is the life of a rush fan  still standouts of this album are seven cities of gold and the anarchist  headlong flight remains my favorite a smile creeps on my face each time it comes up  bu2b of course is a powerful and accessible effort deserving radio time but this is rush and thatll never happen as well as caravan  i also like the lighter halo effect reminds me of how i felt when listening to presto or second nature  the wreckers is also a good effort but it seemed to end too early was waiting for a closing solo that never flourished think bravado prelive  ive never been a fan of fadeout endings to songs wish them well does this too  just play the end of the songthe garden is this albums closing title a seeminglyimportant distinction in rush mythios  ive always been dissatisfied with rushs album closers well after everyday glory restored my faith anyways  its difficult to sit the garden down next to songs like available light or between the wheels but i must confess the song is inspiring  previous efforts carve away the stone and out of the cradle were some of my least favorite album enders and least favorite rush songs period  with snakes  arrows we hold on brought some confidence back in rush albumending tracks i must confess that the garden falls into the later category  it is a great tune that is growing on me like a fungus as i listen to it more  i think this track will become one of my favoritespowerhouse album but overlayered and lacking the finesse of snakes  arrows  still its fun and will see a lot of play time  4stars|1
i loved the original thron birds as well as the book this was probably the worst film ever made first of it doesnt at all compliment the original series weather it be story line or otherwise although richard chamberlain is charming as ever i cannot understand how he could ever acted in this disgraceful film the book didnt even go with this story nothing they added was mentioned in the other movies or book except the background about mary carson which still wasnt covered the fact that luke returns to maggie in this thinking dane is his son is unbelievable considering when maggie last saw him was when she was already pregnant with dane knowing that he wasnt anywhere near her after justine was born it should have struck him as odd that maggie had another child knowing that dane could never have been his plus in the original series maggie pointed out she never returned to luke also considering dane and justine saw father ralph for the first time when they were grown up to begin with makes it very hard to follow with the timeline i tried to picture it as if it happened after the second part of the thorn birds and no matter how i looked at it  nothing goes along with the other movies at all overall this was a major dissappointment|0
the wall is a great album  its better than 95 of the stuff out there whether compared to new rock or classic rock  but there is a lot of filler on the album that doesnt really have any purpose  my favorite song on the album is young lust because the vocals are incredible and the song rocks  and gilmours guitar solo at the end of comfortably numb must be one of the most underrated guitar solos in the history of rock  but the wall is not floyds best album  if youre looking for that try wish you were here or even dark side of the moon|1
ill start with how different this one seems to me different from the last slash work different from any of the gnr work different from what i expected judge that as you see it different could be goodmost of the songs havent grown on me yet but im not going to say they wont standing in the sun is an exciting song that summons up the old power classic locomotive to be honest im not really crazy about the single youre a lie anastasia has a mind blowing introduction and is perhaps my favorite song on the album not for me is a deep song and a little closer to alterbridges catalogue bad rain is dark and creepy song and a sweet surprise that wakes me up toward the end of the album its always great when an album gets better as it progresses instead of having a few good songs up front and then all crappy fillers at the end this album actually gets better toward the end far and away is a sure winner bluesy deep lyrics and beautiful guitar work the two bonus songs not on the cd i bought carolina and crazy life are good rockers worth picking up as bonus tracksoverall this is an album that has a little something for everyone i dont know if its better than the last slash disc but time will tell i think this collaboration is just the beginning of something great slash kennedy fitz and kerns are a solid live band with great chemistry i saw them live the last time around and they were great so i look forward to seeing them again and hearing some of these new tunes live|1
i have been a floyd fan for almost a year now i got dark side of the moon division bell wish you were here and ummagumma i got the wall about one month ago and it is tied with dsotm for my fav pink floyd cd every time i listen to the wall i go on a headtrip and have these images and colours fly through my mind comfortably numb is definetly my favorite floyd song the guitar solo is legendary young lust and run like hell are runners up currently though ive been hooked on the trial i love the dialouge and then when it gets all heavy its so trippy i recomend this album to anyone who doesnt have it if you are a floyd fan or not this is a great album it is worth the 40|1
cyrano de bergerac is one of my favorite plays i have several translations of the play i have it in french i own numerous video versions of the play i have the audio book from caedmon starring sir ralph richardson this however was a terrific surprise this recording is an audio version of the play in french it is not an opera or operetta it stars jeanpaul coquelin an actor who appeared in several french films in the 1950s and 60s although the details on amazon list this product as having 1 disc it actually has three to accommodate the entire play admittedly i am not fluent in french but i was delighted to follow along with the actors in my text if you like cyrano de bergerac if you like french literature or if you just like to have fun in a foreign language this recording is for you this is one of the best products i have ever ordered through amazon i hope you will find this to be true as well|1
this recording is at a slower tempo than his hit recordings and i didnt like it|0
this type of album is a problem with buying on the net its a carboncopy album by a group of electronic musicians which lacks the soul of vangelis in a real shop it would be sold in the bargain bins on amazon its listed and recommended as a vangelis albumsure the playings not too bad but when the originals are out there and easily available from this store theres no need to waste your money|0
this album was too expensive to buy for my older teenage brothers when it came out so apart from the songs played on the radio i never got to hear it as a piece until years laterand i listened to it again last week but my heart is as further away from the album as it ever was i danced in my hospital bed to she loves you as a five year old waiting to have his tonsils out and i love the rest of their stuff but this album is only worth buying if you share the cost with a half dozen other people|0
i love this album slash sounds amazing and so does myles kennedy very good combination i recommend for any slash fans and kennedy fans|1
the incredible aspect of this cd is that it truly captures the beauty despair and relief that are found through movie music  movies are often where one turns to in times of solace and they allow all to escape into the minds of the characters  the music similarly does this but it allows for one to delve into the whole story rather than be limited by the characters  when one hears the beauty and the beast arrangement the whole tragic love story unveils itself  we hear the despair the beast feels the beauty and grace of belle and the tragic love story between them  this process occurs on each track of this cd  it allows one to capture the emotions from the movie in a fraction of the time  on another note i cannot think of a better selection of music to listen to while enjoying a fine date  as background music it can turn an ordinary event into something quite memorable|1
this album is a work of art you seriously dont realize you are stopping from one song and going on to the next  the entire album is one piece of beautiful meaningful heartfelt expressionevery single christmas when i sit down and put this album on it makes me smile  if you cant get into the christmas spirit stick on smitty you will  although his latest effort christmastime is wellacclaimed i think that christmas deserves the spotlight  this is mr smith in fullfledged talent and inspiration  i agree smitty pal if youve been thinking about doing movie soundtracks stop thinking and start writing  christmas is your onestop yuletide album  its just timeless it never gets old  and this humble man with a heart for jesus brings it alive|1
i like raffi and his music  kids are attracted to his lyrics they are short songs that children can learn real easy since most of them are silly and fun|1
i came upon the cd of jacques brel is alive and snapped it up my head filled with the glorious soundsinterpretations of the original cast recording to say the group in london fails to even approach the soul  gusto poignance and power of the original cast is to say that an anthill  is not a prelude to the himalayas alas what a waste of effort and  energybrels ie i came to amazon hoping that the original recording  might have been digitially remastered for cd alas again|0
was posted as almost new and it had scratches on it i dont like to deal with returns especially when i pay so much money for a used item|0
the wall was one of the single biggest albums of the 70s and proved to be a commercial landslide for pink floyd  the two album concept piece is roger waters masterpiece about a musician named pink and the wall he builds around himself  the album is primarily autobiographical and served as the final link in the waters takeover of the band  it is also the last album with the waters gilmour mason and wright lineup keyboard player richard wright would be fired shortly after the albums completion  the album was an unlikely smash hit with the band getting airplay on top 40 radio stations for the first time in their long career  another brick in the wall comfortably numb hey you and run like hell are still staples of classic rock stations to this day  the album was also made into a movie in the mid  80s  as overplayed as this album was and as much as i have listened to it over the years i still enjoy it and think it is a great piece of work  david gilmours guitar solo on comfortably numb can still send chills up my spine and is one of the great melodic solos of all time in my opinion  the wall is one of the classic progressive rock albums of all time|1
it had been at least ten years since i listened to the wall vinyl copy lost to divorce tape copy eaten by car playeryou know one recent day i felt the urge to hear it ordered it on cd waited impatiently for its arrival    but waited for the right time to pop it into the playerlook mummy theres an aeroplane up in the skyddddid you see the frightened ones    ddddid you hear the falling bombs    ddddid you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath the clear blue skynow i know why i wanted to hear it again after 911 that crushing loss of innocence i sat riveted unable to do anything but listen to a life shaped by horrific events wondering how many walls are building out therethe poetry is heartwrenching the musicianship is as solid as anything in rock history this album is as vital as necessary now as it was when i first heard it some 20 years agothe basis of great literature is that it speaks to the universal human condition said my college lit professorlisten to this it speaks|1
im sorry i bought it  i would have been ahead to buy some new age recording  whereas the movie soundtrack which was what i thought i was  getting was absolutely haunting this cd reminded of the old peggy lee  recording is that all there is|0
stunning music but not so stunning interpretation  why  it plods along without spirit or passion  in a choice between this and going without a recording of st matthews passion id rather go without|0
just a brief note here i am not able to listen to the fourchannel version of this recording but i have often listened to the stereo mixdown and found it on the whole very satisfying so that i agree wholeheartedly with dan davis  review not everyone will love the middle section of the second movement with its weird 54 beat and the insistent throbbing of the drum andor the double basses in the background but the fault for this may lie with tchaikovsky who was obviously writing something of a swansong he conducted the first performance only two weeks before his enforced suicide and wanted to create an atmosphere of embittered weltschmerz at this point even in stereo the recording is remarkable for its realism and when i once had the rare privilege of hearing a live performance of tchaikovskys sixth symphony i found myself recognizing a lot of details from the recording  only the oneoff sound of the gong towards the end of the last movement being a bit too soft in the recording the nutcrackersuite is just a filler here it is that tremendous symphony that you want to have originally recorded in paris in 1974 by philips classics total time 65 minutes|1
throughout these compositions a slow progression of electronic droning creates a static field of suspension  interesting  using muted violin and synthesizer both cds have this quiet pensive droning  to quiet to appreciate any undertones nor nuances  gentle musings or microchip borborygmi  whatever the artists intent it all comes across as synthesized oatmeal  credits are given to violin bass trombones but they are all but indiscernable  this is an eclectic electronic ambient project|0
alright im not like the biggest fan of the beatles but this album is bad even for them first off we have the song magical mystery tour which is completely silly reminds me of a theme song for a kids show with puppets  on pbs next is the fool on the hill which is neauseating following that  disgusting little jewel of a song you have flying which sounds like  elevator music youd hear while eating at bob evans after flying we have  the privelege of hearing blue jay way which is a dreary typically  pshycadelic piece of trash by harrison then comes another one of those  show tune gems by mccartney called your mother should know and i wont even  comment on the horror and perversity of that songlets just say that no  self respecting musical would ever use it then comes iam the walrus which  is actually  intriguing and you can actually listen to it without feeling  suicidal unlike your mother should know then hello goodbye which is one  of the most horrid songs theyve ever done i just cant see the point of  that repititive and depressingly cheerful monstrosity strawberry fields is  one of the best songs the beatles ever did i will even go so far as to say  it is a masterpiece of a song this is one of the few beatle songs i can  get enthusiastic over great lyrics wonderful dreamy music i only wish  they would have done more like it after that is penny lane which i cant  stand then baby your a rich man which is another dreary george harrison  thing that is best heard once then forgotton immediantly and last of all  we have shudder all you need is love i cant understand why a band with  a reputation like the beatles would have written such a horrible  disgusting obviously commercial song i dont like the beatles but i never  expected that they would fall to the dephs of this song its like if your  going to san francisco wear some flowers in your hair or what the world  needs now is lovesweet love or that depressing cowsills song the rain  the park and other things i love the flower girl it brings  back such horrid hippie memories perfect song for weekend hippies all the  real hippies listened to the grateful dead or jefferson airplane just  thinking about that song makes me so depressed that i have to listen to  pink floyds the dark side of the moon to get cheered up again the songs  that bad in fact i think that instead of making such a big deal about  marilyn manson parents should make sure their kids dont get hold of this  sewer of filth and depravity good god imagine coming in on your kids one  day winding flowers in their hair and humming all you need is love i think  i would rather find my kids sacrificing cats dressing in black and  listening to goth music than this strange and perverse oddity get this  album for iam the walrus and strawberry fields and record them on a tape  then immediantly burn the cd|0
this recording is second rate  unfortunately this is the only recording of the myslivecek concerto listed on amazon as of this writing and also the only recording of viottis concertothe violin concerto being much more performed  harnoy can really hit it at times but on this recording she often sounds no better than a student and certainly not the caliber of players like krosnick sherry or finckel let alone players that have staked their careers on soloing  in particular her pulse is inconsistent and imprecise and intonation is sometimes a problem  this is a shame because one can clearly hear many good things in her performanceshe is a decent musician and in a couple of rare moments she is even insightful and elegantthe boccherini may be the best performance on this disc  but certainly dont get this disc for the boccherini  there are outstanding performances available by ma du pre casals rostropovich yoyoma and maisky with orpheus the last my own recommendation  but if you like the myslivecek this is your only shot  competent but dont expect much moreas for i solisti veneti theyre alright but not tight nuanced or precise  for the most part they sound like this was the first runthrough|0
each song has its own unique but totally awesome sound and each one slash reminds us a guitar is for more than just background noise reminds me of the days old where lead guitar solos were just as important as the song lyrics love this album|1
i know the beatles a hard days night is great listening because i owned it before but tried to buy it again to replace the one i used to have well seller never shipped it cause they said it was damaged but amazon continues to list it as an item received i wish they would get their act together i dont know how to get it off my items purchased list any body out there that can help want to get this straight imgranmachris|0
free spirit was the third of ken hensleys solo albums as this one was done just after he left uriah heep it appears to be more commerciallymotivated than the other two which were done more for artistic  reasons hensley seems to be attempting to tap into the discotinged rock  sound popular at the time which he is not as well suited to as his usual  mellow introspective acousticelectric guitar and keyboarddriven style  the result is a rather faceless bythenumbers collection which  comparitively lacks kens usual inspiration and magic this album has its  moments however most notably in when a wellconceived lively  multipart dance number that features many of the familiar ken hensley  hallmarks and works brilliantly however most of these songs are subpar in  contrast to hensleys usual songwriting brilliance although competently  performed and sung overall free sirit is listenable and makes for a good  timekiller album if youre a ken hensley fan but it clearly does not  belong in the class of his first two solos|0

hellraiser iii has a lot of spunk  ill give it that  flush from the successes of thefirst twofar superior films hell on earth gets points for not just going through the motionsbut it doesnt get points for anything elsethis movie really shouldve been called the return of pinhead or pinhead be pimpin  not only is the rogue cenobite the central focus for most of the film but he has been made slightly snarkier  well hes always been somewhat snarky he usually gets the films best lines but for the first time you get to seem him cracking wise and then grinning real big about it  the previous pinhead had a sense of humor but was also stoically dedicated  if the movie had been thirty minutes longer this pinhead probably wouldve done a handstand and juggled body organsthe human element of our plot concerns a plucky young newsreporter  her name is joey and she wants to be taken seriously  one day she gets a tip about an accident  she rushes to the hospital and tries to barge into the emergency room of a complete stranger  she yells im a reporter  tell me whats happening  in spite of this the nurses do not allow her in but she can still see through the windows of the doors and she watches as the stranger is yanked apart by electrified and levitating chainsfinally a scoopah but no one takes her seriously  not even jp the sleazy owner of the boiler room the fettishist night club where the chain victim was originally hurt  jp is about as unlikable as any one actor can portray and he is always so caked in makeup his skin appears to be made mostly ofsilly putty  jp has recently purchased an odd sculpture that features a likeness of pinhead  before you know blood accidentally spills on the sculpture blood is always accidentally spilling all over the place in movies like these and next thing you know all hell breaks looseha ha  ive been dying to write that  moving onpinhead is unleashed upon the earth  he begins using the bodies of his victims to make more cenobites to aid him in his quest  the new cenobites look like cartoon versions of the original cenobites  instead of maintaining the hellraiser mythology  cenobites are the result of equal measures of pain and pleasure representing the same sick thrill you and i get from horror movies in the first place  this movie makes them all about mindless death and sacrilegeno harm no foul i guess  you can gussy up movies like this with fancy moralizing and make it fit but for most people the bottom line is pretty much mindless death  still even that lacks the creative flair of the first two filmsultimately though the real killer is the acting  if you are looking for a chuckle and would like to see some astonishingly bad acting rent this film  its hard to know if it can be attributed to the script the acting the directing or all three  whatever the case something was seriously broken and nobody ever got around to fixing itfar sillier than it is scary and more mindless than mental this third installment wants to be taken seriously  just like with poor poor joey that aint gonna happen|0
only one question  where is opera and drama  im tired of dame joan boring singing this is exhibition of high notes and for her it doesnt matter what is this opera about or what  senses are expressed by musicla equally|0
all i have to say about this album is it is the best group of songs pink floyd has ever brought out  it starts out with softly playing music that you can barely hear but then the music starts real loud  in the flesh is  a great rock song the thin ice is great another brick in the wall part  one two and three are great  mother is great  young lust is one of the  best rock songs pink floyd has ever brought out  the end of the first cd  isnt as good as the beginning but the second cd starts off great  hey  you is good  is there anybody out there is one of the best on the album  comfortably numb is the best pink floyd song ever  i love it  run like  hell is great also  this cd is the bestand if you have any pink floyd  albums this has to be one of them|1
there have been many in depth track by track reviews so ill skip that geddys voice  incredible  not the range of years ago of course but he still stretches up there a few times on this cd and nails it instrumentally this effort is tight recording much of it while they were in tour shape was a great idea neils playing seems a little more spontaneous and groove oriented while still pounding the heads into oblivion the often overshadowed talent of alex lifeson shines through as well edgy riffs some bluesy driving melodic lines and well structured solos geddys base is always spot on several songs even have some strings mixed in i could never imagine three guys all around 60 years of age could do this best cd ever  of course not definetely one of their better ones|1
creo que el problema es la casa disquera que no deja que los artistas se superen que puedan crar rey ruiz no hace mas que rodar en un circulo vicioso un gran cantante pero con los mismo arreglos la misma tematica puro reciclaje diferente al nuevo disco de luis enrique ciclos pura innovacion sonidos increibles el voto negatico para sony|0
see millepattescom to learn about la bottine souriante the smiling ankle boot and how to order their cds  lets hope amazon makes all their cds available as millepattes charges 18 per disk the band has ten or so cds  their tenth is known as x in canada and rock   reel in the states  its far from my favorite however  far better  are la mistrine and en spectacle  live  en spectacle includes many tunes from  their previous cds including chapeau and the live versions  are dynamite i saw the band in lafayette la in april 99 and they were  as good in person as on cd  a crew from pbs filmed the concert  we can  hope for a broadcast in the coming months|1
these guys are very talented my favorites are caravan wish them well seven cities of gold headlong flight clockwork angels it is amazing these guys are 60 years old and this cd is progresive rock at its best|1

i have this version of the opus 10 cycle on the original erato cd reissue from 1986 listed neither here nor in france upc 3269658818925 where it was paired with two other concertos rv 441 and 429 it would be unfair to call these readings by jeanpierre rampal and claudio scimone conducting his band i solisti veneti in 1966 the prehistory of the interpretation of baroque music sure they are played on modern transverse flute and not on recorder but still scimone and his solisti veneti though also playing on modern instruments were one of the first ensembles with i musici and marriners academy of saintmartin in the fields to play vivaldi not with a big and thick symphony orchestra but a chamber one and that was considered back then a big step in the direction of what later came to be called period practice still rehearing them today in view of everything that happened since i listened comparatively to versions by marion verbruumlggen and the philharmonia  baroque under nicholas mcgeganvivaldi  recorder concertos  verbruggen  pbo  mcgegan concerto koumllncon tempesta di marecon nottethese two in la tempesta di mare and la notte frans bruumlggen and the orchestra of the 18th century il giardino armonico in the complete cyclevivaldi flute concerti op10andantonio vivaldi concerti da camera vol 1 concerti op 10  giovanni antonini  il giardino armonico my mouth was left gaping although this sounded cutting edge and daring heard back then one realizes now what a long way there was still to go id liken it to the era of the incunables the infancy of printing in the 50 to 70 years after gutenbergs invention of the printing press at least it went a little faster with period practice all the versions used for comparison date from 1979 bruumlggen to 1990but ah it is the fate of pathbreakers to be overpassed by the next generations and made to seem hopelessly passeacute sure the sunny beauty of vivaldis music shines through and the finale of tempesta di mare track 3 the first and third largo tracks 4 and 6 and the second presto end of track 5 of la notte especially the latter may retain some musical validity even today the finale of la notte tr 7 may sound convincing also in a wellmanicured style  as long as you havent heard a recent and more unleashed version like concerto koumllns to say nothing of the breathtaking and demented this is meant as praise giardino armonico in the outer movements of il gardellino tracks 8  10 erato spellt it cardellino in 1986 and of the fourth rv 435 11  13 or the finales of no 5 rv 434 16 and no 6 rv 437 19 there is a freshness and even drive and a polish and elegance in il gardellino throughout from hearing the modern transverse flute rather than the baroque one bruumlggen or the sopranino recorder il gardino armonico that remain quite engrossing heard on their own still there is nothing close to the unbridled enthusiasm the colors the zest the spirit of il giardino armonicoi guess something can be said in favor of the adagio sweet and pretty approach to the first movement of rv 434 track 14 in a kind of twisted and pervert way although it turns the movement into a slow one against vivaldis tempo indication allegro ma non molto and is stylistically completely outofplace  it sounds like music for the salon of marieantoinette likewise the subdued pathos of the same concertos slow movement may track 15 heard on its own has its appeal at least when the flute plays alone when the strings enter it becomes thick and ponderous pathos as well as the discreetly wistful elegance of the largo from the 6th track 18but still i think it might be time for me to get rid of those overall thicktextured and leisurelytoheavyfooted readings although in 1966 they seemed transparent and lightfooted sentimentaltolachrymose in some of the slow movements rv 435 track 12 elephantine in some of the fast ones first movement of no 6 rv 437 track 17 they were invaluable as a step for the next generations to rise higher theyve now lost their usefulness  or if i keep them im still undecided  the beauty of vivaldis music does come through in general and there is an elegance to rampals flute if only rarely the kind of exuberance i expect of vivaldi it wont be so much for listening as for documentary reasons as  an illuminating testimony of the musical sensibilities of the 1960s and 1970s and of how fast they changedthe 1966 recordings retain a background of tape hiss thats not an element that bothers me personally the disc or another reissue has two other entries on this websitevivaldi flute ctosandvivaldi flute concertos  concerti per flauto op 10 due concerti per flauto rv 429441 erato 2292454012|0
i stumbled on this when i was searching for the silly songs cd for my daughter and i am so happy i made the purchase  we actually purchased both the cd  the bookcassette  my daughter is just learning to read and i really wanted her to have the book to go along with the cd  she listens to the cd every night at bedtime and sometimes during the day which is when she is reading along in the book  the typical bedtime cds available now just dont seem to have this much variety  some of the songs are more upbeat than the typical bedtime song but when playing at a low volume seem to be very calming|1

john j martinez basically has it all covered  a fantastic review  i would just like to add a few of my observations or comments about the music  mr martinez explained each song  if there is really any bad points with the music on this album is that it is more thematic than other rush albums  it has a story running through it and one that will later be a novel  concept albums are usually the poorest sellers of most bands  exceptions being pink floyd and the who come to mind  the kinks got dropped from two labels due to their grandiose concept albums i being a big fan still bought and liked those albums but few others did  i feel that the most recent nightwish album suffers from being tied to closely to a storyline  but this rush album is actually really good anyway  of course rush has some experience with this in a different form  they have a few songs that are in several related tracks spanning several albums  stories among many unrelated songs on the same albums that connect with a later albums song a fairly unique techniqueabout this album specifically alex gets more guitar solos in than on the last several rush albums  and the solos are really varied and different from most that he has ever done before  i dont know if anyone else has noticed it but i definitely hear a lot of things on this album that remind me of led zeppelin  not that any song sounds like a lz song just a lot of little subtleties  and that is not a bad thing  the point being i dont ever remember rush reminding me of anyone other than rush  i have all their original albums not all compilations  well as a professional musician friend of mine once said there are only so many notes in a scaleon the down side the lyrics on this album dont grab me immediately as much as some of my favorite rush songs  but perhaps as i understand the story better ill get into it more  also the tempo of the middle of the albums get a bit repetitive  but not so much as to make it boring i really liked neils sci fi stuff on many past albums  i just love the strangeness of the repeated line 1001001 in the body electric i believe that is binary for 73  could 1973 be the year the band originally formed  as i said at the outset martinez got it down  hopefully you get something out of my doodlings here|1
i was a huge fan of the show when it aired most twisted mind beep of a show often id be left staring at the tv after the credits like be like wtf man lol but still end up watching it again great sound track and loooong some songs are like 13 minutes|1
i dont know why this is marked as music the melodies are grotesque the vocals are abominable complete trash and the artists should not quit their day jobs as pan handlersi only wish i could forget|0
i still have trouble listening to this album after all these years  spector ruined what was really an ok effort not great  i sense the hand of alan klein at work yet again  this may have been a final cash in but the listener is left wondering what the hell happend here  the only two songs that ever capture me are the george harrison penned tunes  to me this album is personified by imemine|0
i hope this wasnt meant to be in the comedy  thats what i purchased it for and was very disappointed  this cd was very stupid  and not funny at all  i thought one of the ideas of comedy was to bring out the ridiculousness in society  i guess he tried doing that but failed in my opinionwaste of money|0
this is an interesting album  in my opinion a refined version of the previous album  if you are purchasing this album to hear sammymike vh or joe the technician in solo you wont find it  this is a new band a new concept by impassioned musicians  chickenfoot iii is a studio creation perfection unlike the prior album where the band comes together as a group rather than efforts of individual musicianslistened to without comparison of previous work by any musician this album is outstanding  each musician has their own trademarks  they are brought together seamlessly in this albumi remember sammy saying at a vh concert how hard it was to be screaming in concert all the time  in this album he sings without screaming and uses his loud voice for pushing parts of the lyricsa critic said none of the music sticks  a new music composer once said that young people like repetition in there music it makes the music memorable  makes me think they are adhd  no massive repetition here  sammy tells his stories in his lyrics  chickenfoot repetition comes from playing the album again and againa true reinvention of themselves  enjoy|1
i am not particularly impressed with this cd and honestly i wish i hadnt purchased it  i would recommend simply downloading belly dancing music to your mp3 player if you need it|0
wtf in the age of highdefinition recording one would think that such a historic band as pink floyd would warrant releasing a special edition for the anniversary edition and not just a regular frickin cd why not an sacd or at least a dvdaudio edition of wywhmakes my opinion of record companies slide that much lower than the sewer they are in right now|0
this soundtrack is a good example of why a soundtrack can not always just be put on an audioonly medium these melodies are ok as a dramatic sound illustration of the things happening on the big screen but just listening  to these illustrations becomes pure boredomthe classical stuff sounds  like some halfdone mixture between a bad plagiate of vince dicola and a  string rehearsal but the worst thing is that karl jenkinsish choir but  with less fantasy ruining every single trackits like one long melody  anyway and not even with a great deal of variation in the theme a  singlecd would have been clearly enough then we might have been saved  from the standard diva ballad from ceacuteline dion as well oh what wishful  thinking|0
the wall was probably the best pink floyd album to date as any floyd fan would agree or not some of your tastes are just odd it signified a descent from stardom into insanity the story of a man who builds a psychological wall around himself cutting himself off from the world around him and running his childhood memories back through his mind like a reel of 8mm film it was certainly was a dark depressing way to end what was a great band after the wall pink floyd fell apart what with the firing of richard wright tensions between band members and roger waters who really couldnt get over the success of the wall his later music was along the same line politics and theatrical epicsounding music even though this album was pretty much the downfall of the band its nothing to be disheartened about they left a magnificent parting gift from the manic rushing of in the flesh and just plain scariness of one of my turns and dont leave me now to the raw quiet insanity of is there anybody out there and in the flesh the second one the album sucks you into pinks psychadelic guilt and memory trip the song vera though short was actually really good i thought also the trial was a great piece of music it was almost like a theatrical presentation as i mentioned earlier i would recommend this album to most pink floyd fans mostly because its the last real floyd album the final cut doesnt really count and neither do the gilmour albums which are good in their own ways and also because its just a great thoughtprovoking album|1
i should have read these reviews before i bought this cd  not only is there talking which i am not interested in and find annoying but they also cut the songs shorter i was interested in a nice musical arrangement that i could play during the day for my family while the tv is off  if i wanted to hear the lines of the movie i would put in the dvd that i already have  what a waste of money  you can find my copy of this cd on sale at ebay used only once|0
hellraiser iii hell on earth anthony hickox 1992i figured since id already crushed my teen years by watching hellbound and seeing how it didnt hold up i might as well kill off the nostalgia of my twenties as well and give hell on earth another watch all i really remembered about this one was that lieutenant dax terry farrells role from star trek deep space nine was in it and that the cameraman dude that i always thought was hulk hogan its actually phantom of the paradises ken carpenter always answered the phone with speak once cell phones got big i couldnt wait to buy one so i could do that nothing else about the movie really stayed with me and that should have been a cluespoiler alert the plot synopsis in the following paragraph contains a major spoiler the major spoiler really for hellbound hellraiser ii the rest of the review contains spoilers for this film depending on which ones you havent seen and intend to you may want to stop reading now im not recommending thisplot wouldbe impresario j p monroe  beauty schools kevin bernhardt who semiretired from acting in the midnineties and is now a screenwriter finds a suspiciously familiar if youve seen hellboundthough it is by no means identical piece of art in an otherwiseempty gallerya spinning column covered with a grotesque collage he purchases it and installs it in his new bar the boiler room which immediately becomes notorious for its patrons flying off the handle inappropriately j ps girlfriendoftheweek terri cheaper by the dozens paula marshall leaves him just after a strange incident at the club is covered by budding reporter joey summerskill farrell joey and terri hook up as joey is looking for the story behind whats going on at the club while terri needs a place to live as joey gets closer to the story it becomes more dangerous as pinhead who was imprisoned in the column at the end of hellbound has managed to extricate himself enough to force j p to bring him victims as he needs blood to gain strength on the other hand j p is smart enough to realize that if this guy ever gets free bad things will probably occurtheres a lot of just plain stupid in this movie would you patronize a club that played soup dragons and kmfdm back to back and then when it was time for a live band brought on armored saint but what really killed me is how bad this movie crushes canon i mean a huge part of the mythology in the first two moviesthough it only really comes out in hellboundis how damn hard it is to become a cenobite you have to want it its not something that just happens casually and it can certainly be inferred from dr channards antics in hellbound that cenobites are a all equals powerwise and b not necessarily sympathetic towards one another and yet after the boiler room massacre we find ourselves with a whole batload of new cenobites all of whom seem to be under pinheads control uh what thats actually cool as a standalone tableau though like the channard cenobite from hellraiser these new thralltype cenobites seem to work very much against the original characters that barker created but within the frame of the universe thats been put together over the course of the last two films it doesnt make a damn lick of sense ultimately thats what kills the movie for me and makes me wonder why the minority of hellraiser fans who do like this filma minority among which until very recently i counted myselfstill do |0
dont be fooled this is a great album has a rythm and blues feel to it the lyrics are cool you can feel these guys had fun writing this album completely disagree with the 1 star ratings or for that matter anything less than 3 stars some people have anger issues the music is great definitely better than some of the older sammy albums its a bit different laid back its all sammy hagar material here nothing surprising and in no way are these guys selling on their big names alone cant wait to see them again in concert|1
this cd stands out in my mind as one of the best of michael w smiths career and one of my personal favorites from the opening notes of overtureo come all ye faithful to the closing notes of silent night this is a musicaal masterpiece two of my favorites on here are no eye had seen a beautiful duet with amy grant and gloria michaels version of angels we have heard on high if you dont already have this i definitely recommend getting it|1
this movie is over all a horrid mess  pinhead goes from a overwhelming intimidating factor to a wisecracking horror freak  there are some creative new cenobites but thats itthe story revolves around a reporter who is trying to find out how this boy died  as it turns out he stole the box and opened it  pinhead himself is trapped in this statue that an art collector night club owner buys  after pinhead is freed he kills everyone in the club makes 4 new cenobites who die easily and kills a priest just for good funthis movie loses the flair that the past two entries held pinhead didnt massacre hundreads of people jus for the sheer enjoyment he only came out when the box was opened and killed the person who opens it plain and simple  this movie oveall is garbage except for die hard collectors|0
i treated myself to this cd right before i took a road trip and it was perfect driving music burgess rocks he mustve been smoking for years to cultivate a voice that rich and gritty and he more than does justice to tiger rose which springsteen wrote for himand honestly who doesnt like listening to a righteous rockabilly album  on a wideopen interstate even when youre driving a little silver subaru and not a big black cadillac|1
awsome  ive first heard this harp music by kim robertson when i bought a tape over 15 years ago  i listened to it over and over while i was seriously ill in hosp and it was a life saver for my peace and tranquility  i still have the tape but have ordered the cd to play on my bose which i play often especially during the chirstmas season|1
john is a temendous resource for everyone from the lay person to the experienced chanter this is a great buy|1
if you love great standup comedy without all the filthy language this cd is for you  brian shows us that you dont need a lot of expletives to make people laugh  hysterical|1
this is the worst pink floyd album  learning to fly is good sorrow is okay one slip and yet another movieround and around are tolerable on the turning away is lame signs of life and the dogs of war are totally pointless and i wont even say anything about a lame machine part i and an even more lame machine part iitoo late  if you are a diehard fan you know that you have to get this eventually but dont waste your money if youre a casual listener  its not even good for 80s music  that says a alot  usually i try to write about the good things in albums but its near impossible to do with this  amlor should have been calle a complete lapse of coolnessyeah  take that  i dont know maybe im a little hard on david gilmour and gang here  nonope  if youre wanting some later floyd then the division bell is what you want  amlor is kind of an ungood version of tdb|0
i had heard the music at a peace conference and wanted to have the mucic available at home  thank you for asking|1
i always use amazoncom because its the fastest way to order online they ship out orders quickly and all prices match or even sometimes beat other corporate competitors the whole ordering process is simple making it easy for anyone to use|1
i was especting nice simple quiet melodies to lull me to sleep this cd was not thati thought the title was totally wrong for the music didnt help me sleep at all|0
they should never have bothered with this one waters was right by the mid1980s pf was a spent creative force|0
the recording of chopins works is excellent that is to say the musicians bring a wonderful energy and depth to the pieces its just that my favorite composer frederic seems almost awkward in the creation of these sonatas both piano and cello each has a kind of shallow quality not found in the composers brilliant ballads scherzos short piano pieces and concerti still his sonatas remain far more substantial in my mind than the ponderous sturm und drang chamber music of brahms and the ride em  cowboy 19th century dvorak however chamber music remains magical in the canons of haydn  mozart beethoven schubert and debussy whose late and delicately magnificent chamber music seems almost too good for people|0
i m going to keep this short this album is the 20th studio release from one of the most astoundingly creative and powerful trios to ever live words can not describe how brilliant the 20th album clockwork angels is  it is a 100 gift to the fans from one of the most prolific artists to take the stage only pink floyd can convey a story more vividly and they have been separated for some time due to creative differences do your self a favor get the album today listen to it many times soak it in lyrics concept music drums bass and guitargo to a show and i dare you to tell me you are not astounded at the delight and brilliance that is and always will be in music history r  u  s  h|1
i do not like much the music by this group but room in your heart is a special case i find it is one of the sweetest melodies i heard in the last six months i heard it on one fm here in buenos aires and i could not find  it in the cd stores here not even in tower records|0
without a doubt  this album is the best i have ever listened to  its christmas  but i listen to it throughout the year  i still purchase this cd for gifts  and the receivers rave about it  it lifts you into a realm of worship and awe  no other christmas album has come close to this masterpiece  thank you smitty|1
i would give this about 25 stars  there are only 8 songs on here or the rating would be higher  and also i think that since this came out all the songs are on other cds  it has some big songs on here  ive always been crazy dont you think this outlaw bits done got out of hand are you sure hank done it this way and shine are some of his biggest hits  and some of my favorite songs by himthe rest of the songs house of the rising sun ill go back to her old friend and belle of the ball are good songs also  with ill go back to her probably my least favorite  this isnt a bad cd  its only 26 minutes long so they had enough room to put plenty of more songs on here|0
i was so excited to hear the les mis csr but the casting really disappoints me im generally okay with most of the cast but i simply can not listen to debra byrne as fantine i love a nice strong vibrato but hers is simply out of control im sorry but its completely unnecessary for every single note to be sung with vibrato and i find all of the fantine parts totally unpleasant to listen to also kaho shimada as eponine just upsets me as well im sure she did well when she played eponine in the tokyo production but she does not speak english for this recording she learned her entire role in english phonetically its very distracting to listen to her stumble through the lyrics and i still cant understand why she was cast for this english recording when so many other english fluent eponines exist if only this recording had cast ruthie henshall as fantine and lea salonga as eponine i would be a very happy camper its just such a shame that the csr album with musical footage not available on any other album is so poorly cast|0
my son and i love it  i wish i knew french for the song that is sung in english and french|1
i have no idea who was the genius who thought of jessye norman as carmen it is a pity that such an important singer as she turned out such a disastrous performance everything is wrong in her portrayal sense of style characterisation charmthe don jose and the escamillo are hardly better only mirella freni even well past her prime gives any pleasure ozawa conducts a grandiloquent verismo carmen like they used to do in the 50s even if you are a fan of norman i would strongly recommend to stay away from this recording if you are looking for a truly great recording of carmen look no further than teresa berganzaclaudio abbado in dg the best recording ever of bizets masterpiece other good alternatives are victoria de los angelesbeecham and tatiana troyanossolti but berganza is the most passionate and magical carmencita of all|0
now before you take me to task for the title of the review let me say that this is not a review of the music or the most influential band in history rather it is a review of the remixremaster of this amazing work all im gonna say is either mix and remaster in proper stereo so it sounds like music not a disjointed random hodgepodge of this herethat there or leave the work alone anybody got a mono copyunlistenable|0
i highly recommend this collection of raffi music  it is an amazing price and there are so many amazing songs  my 2 year old loves singing with the raffi music  we listened to this album on a recent road trip and it was a fun time for the whole family  i love how the music is educational  children are learning while having fun|1
i bought the cassette tape of this several years ago and was so excited to finally find the cd this is one of the most relaxing and mystical works that i have ever encountered wish i could find more of this type of musicit literally puts you in a different world a great pick for massage therapists or reiki practitioners|1
what can i say that hasnt been said before ultimately the best album of all time hands down|1
a promising start the first song sounds like the original recording but cleans up nicely within a minute or sothe next three songs sound wonderful remastered and perfected  great beatles musicand then the train wreck beginsyoure gonna lose that girl sounds warped and atonal as though the reels were speeding up and slowing down throughoutsuddenly its like i cant trust the music being released herethe following tracks form a composite of material from several albums and theres more pitch issues as well  ive just seen a face sounds sped upone thing i loved about the beatles was the sense of composition of a complete record  this music is chopped up and concludes with a song from a different era dizzy miss lizzy that has nothing to do with the help conceptin essence i do not recommend this  it disturbs everything great about the beatles and destroys the context of most of the material found on this cd  a great disappointment|0
the first song i heard by flyleaf was cassie and it interested me enough that i looked for more from flyleaf i love all the songs on the album my favorites being cassie fully alive red sam and all around me lacey has such a great voice being able to go from extremes really well normally i dont like or listen to christian or religious music but i had to make an exception for this one|1
the mp3 link here does not get you the complete product  after you pay and download you find you get only the last album and it does not even include the bonus track|0
i was very disappointed in this dvd purchase i own the majority of the hellraiser series on dvd but was missing hellraiser iii and wanted to replace my vhs copy i ordered this for a great price and got a bootleg product this so called dvd is obviously a copy as compared to the dvds released prior to and after hellraiser iii to make it worse the so called new dvd is less than vhs quality since the actual vhs which i have is not as dark  after reviewing my other dvds and a little research i realized that most of the dvds are madeproduced by dimension home videofilms and trans atlantic entertainment i see trans atlantic entertainment listed on the back but the box has top ten new media production limited hksar all over it even has it on the opening screen ok so they have that posted in the description for top ten i shouldnt have to validate the authenticity of a new dvd by knowing all the details about the film and who officially released it should i as for the dvd itself it will only play in one of my two dvd players for the one that plays the only option it has is to start movie or pick one of six chapters no trailer no production notes nothing else at all except for bad audio and video by the way i ordered this as special edition there is nothing special about it additionally we all know that a new dvd typically has an air tight wrapper that we have to cut off and security seals this new movie had nothing of the sort and the case was designed for two cddvdsnote i went back and read some of the other comments some were good lucky you if you got the legit product but as far as the ones i see with similar issues and quality welcome to the world of bootleg reproductions i could be wrong but i believe this recopied media violates amazoncoms policy on items that can be listed for sale if by some freak chance that top ten new media production limited is legitimate and authorized for some unknown reason to reproduce poor dvd copies for sale i recommend you all avoid everything produced by them i have worked with customs officials and been overseas and seen a lot concerning bootleg dvds this is a prime example people ok guess i am done with my rant cant help it since i am a big fan of the series all excited to get it just to be left down|0
perhaps the very best rock concept album ever created in the history of mankind this is the story of a boy who grows up to be a rock star who eventually goes crazy because of isolation roger waters the main composer and lyricist was inspired by the isolation he though he felt when he performed live the distant space the difference between the audience and the band pink floyd performingalmost the whole story is flashbacks and memories of his past life he remembers that his dad was killed in wwii then he remembers that when he was in school his teacher was very mean to him he ridiculized him so he wanted to rebel against him and the whole system of the school here comes the wellknown song another brick in the wall pt ii this whole rebellion never took place in fact it was just young pinks will  we are also told that when the teachers got home at night they were beaten and scolded by their wives this tells us that they took revenge against the students then comes a description of pinks mother  she was way overprotective she didnt let pink develop by himself as it should have been she helped to build this wall a psychological wall that kept him from the others isolated him and kept him from having a normal life her mom ironically turns out to be a brick in the wall so does the school and the teacher the song goodbye blue sky can be interpreted as a change in pinks life hes moving on could be from his childhood to his life as a teen  pink knows that the wall harms him isnt good for him nevertheless he feels safe behind the wall normal behavior it is easier for us to turn away from our fears than to face them then pink tries to call his wife in the present his wife lives in england he is in the us and finds out that shed cheated on him was with someone else in the song young lust he is looking for a groupie to pick up he gets himself a nice groupieslut and takes her to his hotel which is somewhere in la  in the next song he is talking to the groupie and society he says he doesnt wanna be left and he needs them  in the next songs he realizes or thinks that everyone and everything in his life so far has been just bricks in the wall meaning that it all has harmed him psychologicallythe death of his father influenced his life a lot and caused an inrreversible psychological harm in the song comfortably numb the tour manager pink is on the road walks into his room and sees that his is as stoned as hell then a doctort comes and shoots an injection into his arm to make him feel normal again he then tells the sensation of being numb and the feelings reeled in him he is brought back to normality and goes to perform at the concert the song is the same as the first one the one he performed in the other concert at the beginning but he starts insulting and discriminating the audience however they dont seem to care the next song is part of the concert the song waiting for the worms the worms symbolize the decadence of pink his dacat what the wall has done unto him  in the song stop he says that hes had enough hes still in the concert and wants to go back to his home take off his uniform and leave the show but he was waiting in that prison cell the way pink sees the concrt or even his life beacause he wanted to know if hed been guilty all the time then come the song the trial which is a psychological trial there really is no trial its all going on inside pinks head in which he judges himself the main characters of the opera whove helped to build the wall his mom the teacher his wife are questioned and at the end the judge decides that he is guilty and sentences him to be exposed before his peers and to tear down the wall this part is interesting because pinks punishment is to be taken out of the wall the wall torn down but this is good for him he realizes hes been guilty for letting the wall be built  in the next and last song outside the wall whose lyrics go all alone or in twos the ones who really love you walk up and down outside the wall some hand in hand some gathered together in bands the bleeding hearts and artists make their stand and when theyve given you their all some stagger and fall after all its not easy banging your heart against some mad buggers wall we are told that the ones who love and care about pink are outside the wall which is natural so is heso we see that the story has turned full circle pink is back behind the wall again and it is always gonna be this way if he eventually manages to get out of the wall again he will be back behind it to endorse this pink floyd the band decided to play a little bit of the music that closes the opus it is a harmonica i think playing quietly in the background right after outside the walls lyrics are all sung in the very beginning of track 1 of disc i in the flesh and there is even a hidden message the first part in disc ii the second part in disc i which says this is where we came inwell thats it if youre still reading thank you for reading cos it took me a long while to type all this babbling|1
i received this cd with a paper photocopied cover  this was definitely not mentioned in the description  i sent it back at my own cost and was refunded the purchase price  complete rip off  avoid this trader  everything else ive bought has been amazing but this was just a shambles|0
a very highly recommended compilation of music  i love the songs that are chosen and the arrangements are pleasant fun and memorable  a great cd by a true musician|1
and that means a lot to me the wall really to me isnt a collection of songs put together for a concept album to me its one whole song i dont listen to songs from this album either the whole 90 some minutes or forget it really this is roger waterss solo album its so dark forget metal forget black sabbath forget it this is fking dark david gilmours riffs shine and i cant believe how much emotion roger waters puts in every song there is really good sound effects and lets not forget the epic solo on comfertably numb god that brings me to tears every time i listen to it the first emorock album in my opinion very good the film is also very good visually and muisically very nice|1
some of the arrangements when johnny comes marching home are original as in historically accurate arrangements  and this album contains songs that i couldnt find elsewhere i couldnt even find complete lyrics for some of the songs much less a recording of some eg we are boys of potomacs ranks what i like about many of the songs is the simplicity of the arrangements theres no large choir here when johnny comes marching home is quite powerful the two main singers maybe the only singers with overdubbing are a male and a female as noted earlier neither are very good singers in particular the females voice is not good at all and  can be hard to take why have a female record aura lea anyway  so this is a drawback in an otherwise fine compilation of music|1
very dramatic music  felt like a battle  not an easy listening type of music by any stretch of the imagination|0
especially when the sound quality is just so bad you have to strain to hear just what bernstein is saying for peter and the wolf and the volume levels increase only slightly for the carnival of the animals making this an extremely boring cd and definitely not worth the money  id recommend waiting for a remastered version of this to be released or to get some other version instead|0
just bought a copy of this incredible album released by the legendary canadian power trio rush it was with great pleasure that i saw our brazilian edition bringing the lyrics and a very good artwork the same as the imported cds about the band these guys are playing better and better year after year solid rock and roll as usual my favourite track  9 headlong flight same style as snakes and arrows which for me is more than enough|1
i agree with the other reviewersthe dialogue basically ruins the whole thing i just wanted to and still want to hear the unadulterated music themes couldnt they just have put the dialogue between the songs|0
i have been an avid floyd fan for quite some time now and i have to say beyond a shadow of a doubt this album is the best it leads you through a twisted maze of a man losing his mind it is a brilliant album and has a  well plotted storyline the true talent is evident here if you enjoy floyd  or psycadelia this is a must have and check the movie too|1
boy do i wish id checked out this site before buying this cd it says on the shrinkwrap soundtrack it is not it is a score background music you didnt notice between the crystal  method tricky and ithaka tracks theyre not here you didnt notice this  music during the movie and you certainly dont want to pay 17 for it ive  never taken a cd back before but this suckers history this is fraud if  i wanted to listen to john tesh none of the great techno tracks from the  movie here very disappointed and deceived if anybody wants to start a  class action lawsuit against columbia for deception im in excellent  movie loved it but they dropped the ball here|0
if there were any doubts about slashs solo career after the first album this will blast them awaythe chemistry these guys have both in the studio and live is astounding  the riffwork is stellar and practically every song has something awesome about itkeep it comin slash|1
this record established a new standard in musical and technical quality and a border between the before and the after it is excellent under many aspects and includes some killer songs such as  another brick in the wall ii mother  comfortably numb plus many beautiful songs goodbye blue  sky nobody home  too many to be listed really the  experimental mix of music and live takes which started back  with alans psychedelic breakfast is brought here close to  perfection technically it is a reference and better than tdsotm you  could never say it is 22 years old the timbre and quality of pianos  keyboards guitars make it a true classic in fact it sounds  better than most albums recorded nowadays  is it perfect no the  conceptual architecture in which the pink floyd framed their  music is somewhat weak the sequence of themes is not always coherent some  of the songs are weaker than the rest the atmosphere is here and there a  little gloomy  were it not for these few very few weak points this would  be the music record as it is however it is one of the best albums ever  recorded|1
great comedy like any great art is great because it endures  george carlins material for example has endured for decades and it will continue to endure it will be as poignant fifty years from now as it is todaythe problem with the comics who do impressionscomics like franciscois that their material has a shelflife of about twelve minutes  sixty years ago if you did a good impression of humphrey bogart youd probably get a lot of laughs  but today the same impression would be met with blank staresthe guy who does the movie preview voice today will not be the one who does them in the future and likewise in the future that impression will have lost all its value as no one will be familiar with the referencelook ahead to the future a new comic doing a new impression of the new movie preview guy getting a lot of laughs  and pablo francisco  nobodys ever heard of him  his act has vanished into the eternal dusts of time|0
they have outdone themselves this is awesome they worked on it for a long time and its well worth the wait|1
its amazing that the chicago symphony once the toast of the orchestral world never recorded strauss alpine symphony before this  most of their other strauss recordings are considered definitive  so like many i was looking forward to this issue which turned out to be a disappointing train wreck  like all of eratos recordings with barenboim and the cso the recording levels are frustratingly low and the sound has a thin shrill quality  it sounds as though most of this recording was made when the orchestra especially the brass was very tired  gone is the power and breadth of the chicago sound replaced by poor intonation feeble tone quality and sloppy ensemble  its amazing that anyonebarenboim the cso or eratos producersallowed this horror show onto the market  i recommend the cleveland orchestras powerful alpine symphony performance on the decca label with vladimir ashkenazy conducting|0
in his prime julius larosa was the best however this album a late rehash of his classics fails to deliver his voice while familiar has lost much of its passion and strength if looking for the old larosa dont look here get the original recordings instead|0
i find myself loving individual tracks on this album more than the album itselfas a whole  this is different for a floyd album in that reapect  yes it has a central theme clearly but there are tracks that i just dont like at allheres my adviceget a turntable and buy some floyd lps  it is the only way to experience their music  crank up a really good stereo system turn the lights off and let it spin baby hint vinyl particularly floyd lps sound like heaven|1
what an awsome inspiring wonderful cd i absolutely believe that smitty is one of the most gifted christian artists this cd absolutely proves beyond a shadow of any doubt his excellence in this genre  if you buy only one christmas cd this is the one to buy  it isnt exactly what you expect chorus orchestra guests ie amy grant etc  truely one of the best|1
this is flat out the most selfloving album ever made  actually i used to listen to the beatles then of course i turned 12  they made no significant impact on music  if they werent making disposable teenpop melodies ie i wanna hold your hand they were making artsyfartsy stuff like wild honey pie  i would love to hear the pitch session for that song  hey paul lets say the same thing over and over for 30 seconds  itll be brilliant  ill be that was john lennons idea only his stupidity could come up with that  and while were on him lets talk about revolution no 9  okay people think axl rose got selfindulgent on november rain but at least that was a song  rev 9 is purely the stupidest thing ever laid down in a recording studio  period  and you wanna talk about uninspired lyrics look at why dont we do it in the road or helter skelter  that is some of the worst songwriting i have ever had the displeasure of hearing in my entire life  of course since it was the beatles people pinned some kind of great artistic merit to it without even considering the fact that it may not be very good  the only reason this has one star is because i cant give it 0  if i could believe me i would  in fact i would probably give it less than zero if at all possible  i know you beatles fans are probably gonna think im just some jealous wackedout crack addict  but let me tell you this right now  you only think theyre the best because youve been preprogrammed to believe that  youve had it shoved down your throats that theyre the greatest ever so you buy it  but if you tell a lie enough times you start to believe it|0
i can not even comment on the quality of the songs and musicans some of it sounds pretty good because in my opinion elvis crespo has a terrible voice i find his singing nasal and winey  to the point of being almost unlistenablei hate to say it but i just cant get thru this album because i just dont like his voice  well to each his own|0
salvo has done an excellent job packaging this cd it includes great photos and notes sonically the remastering is amazing salvo has put much work in attempt to deliver a quality product that a historic album like shine on brightly deserves with their attention to detail and all the hard work they put into this cd how did salvo not notice they got the speed of the album terribly wrong this remaster is running way too fast didnt they bother to listen to it when they were finished gary brookers voice just doesnt sound right at this speed and it makes this remaster unlistenable for me i would like to know if salvo has any plans to remedy this|0
it is not the same as the original grease they tried too hard and it doesnt have the magic it was nice to see michele pfeiffer singing but otherwise avoid this movie unless you are really really hardcore grease fan|0
the wall is not just an album its life story thats the reason why the wall is timeless touch so many aspects about human life  isolation lonelyness sorrow hapiness lies madness etc  that its the most powerful and touching album ever madeits not a weird thing why this album has been the most succesful one among the rock albums and the second one in the music history  the first one is michael jackson the wall throws the heart out of your chest makes you to think about your own life and about other oneshow many albums do you have on which each track is made for the the next number  most of todays music is ephimeral but the wall has survived for 25 years and it will keep doing timelessmost of bands nowadays must release short albums radio frienly with 11 or 12 songs containing at least 6 filler numbers no connection no meanings nothing just pure commercial crapbut inside the wall youll find an experience those kinds of albums you must listen from the first second until the last one i mean even from the very first second   isnt thiswhen we came here try to listen those words if youre astute youll realise what im talking about moreover not just in the lyrics youll find connections and relationships the music is played tighly and youll find a lot of messages on it for example the album starts with a few seconds of outside the wall  therere a lot of voices before comfortably numb including the teacher  appeared at the end of another brick in the wall part ii  the girl  appeared at one of my turns etc even youll find echoes guitars on is there anybody out there  thats makes the album so exciting and interesting youll find a lot of secret messages on it unlike boring and predictable todays musici know youve listen a lot another brick in the wall part ii comfortably numb run like hell and played a lot that classic guitar from is there anybody out there but the wall is so fantastic that makes you forget the previous songs while youre listening to the next ones thats amazing keeping you inside the main history told in this albumthis album is a book of life a life filled with extraordinary music and lyricsthe most magnificent masterpiece from music historyps i really want to see someday pink floyd the wall live dvd  theres enough footage filmed both on 1980 and 1981  |1
the rush of 2112 is back the band of moving pictures the conceptual maestros of concept albums their 20th studio album and they sound as ferocious and powerful as ever clockwork angles is neil pearts musing on faith and hope in the time of tragedy and is allegedly inspired by the work of 17th century french philosopher voltaires candide having lost his wife and daughter then his drum mentor peart took a journey into the wilderness and came back with the seeds of what is this album as he intones on the opener i cant stop thinking bigthat alone should tell you youre in for a near classic rush cd the band or at least the central character in the upcoming novelization of the album is traveling through time and making sense of the chaos surrounding him he meets up with the anarchist in a seven minute allthestunts progrocker and the carnies who pound the drums between the flint and steel and games of chance the basswork here alone will melt your lasersthen there are the songs that are trademark rush like the opening caravan that starts our journey and headlong flight which propel you through the plot with reckless efficiency i wish i could live it all again screams geddy lee in fine voice as he defies the clockmaker to make him downtrodden about the curves life has thrown his way and the rest of the band is pulsing with muscle right in their behind him or the effoff of wish them well as lee tells us to ignore the cynics and make peace with what life has for youclockwork angels is a dense and powerful album and given the longintoothiness of the band rush are still staking out territory few contemporaries can even dip their toes in maybe peart measures out a life that goes from bad to worse bu2b but he is still optimally a heartbeat in a band that plays by its own set of rules and seems to find ways to make time stand still for their fans and for their own sense of optimism|1
a real nice album some great arrangements a few of which were popular for a while with college and hs jazz bandsthe playing is just great  dick oatts just plays his heart out as usual and jim mcneely on piano too this is just one of a number of few excellent recordings out there by the mel lewis jo and tad jonesmel lewis jo too all worth a listen|1
i have the original 33 lp record this doesnt sound anything like this the voice is too smooth for rod |0
a true powerful miracle of epic rush proportions this album is a triumph and packed with power and emotion 12 songs  all dynamic and masterful buy this now|1
the russian composer alfred schnittke first gained official condemnation in his native soviet union and praise abroad for his unique style he called polystylism the use of baroque ation alongside dissonant 20thcentury stylizings and allusions to mozart alongside snippets of tangos and popular tunes in 1985 however he suffered his first stroke and his music grew more austere and selfcontained further strokes led to an even greater straitening in his writing the two pieces here are good examples of how plain and grim his music ultimately became and though i admire the man for still daring to write under such odds i find the music itself of much lesser quality than that of his polystylistic heydayschnittkes symphony no 8 1994 begins with a fivenote motif passed from one instrumental group to another before growing to a climax it reminds one somewhat of the repetition of dsch in shostakovichs tenth though sad instead of triumphant and it seems to be setting the stage for a drama of immense proportions this sense of approaching action however is upset by the second movement which curiously undoes itself the third movement marked lento is a slow stringscape its ponderous sentimental in a messiaenlike fashionand 17 minutes long far outstaying its welcome the fourth and final movement instead of offering suitable closer ends after a mere two minutesthe third movement of the symphony exhibits a fatal flaw of much of schnittkes late work things tend to drag on too long there are other examples but besides this i think the watchingpaintdry opening of the symphony no 6 is the most notorious but beyond that i have a hard time appreciating the bulk of schnittkes symphonies simply for their lack of anything new schnittke was retreading ground already discovered by mahler and unnecessarily repeated by shostakovich having been dazzled by the six soon seven symphonies of per norgard and the single but brilliant symphony of sofia gubaidulina i appreciate the symphonic genre as a chance to showcase never before heard concepts in massive proportions as much as many of schnittkes symphonies offer some repertoire thats new but which wont upset the conservatives too much they fail to teach the fan of contemporary music anything that he didnt know beforethe concerto grosso no 6 1993 doesnt drag as much as the symphony indeed its schnittkes shortest effort in the genre at 14 minutes long and not only is it unusually short but it leaves behind the ties to bach that are the hallmark of his earlier concerti grossi unfortunately here too schnittke falters for the dramatic potential that seems in store among violin and piano soloists and orchestra is never fully realized and the piece comes to an end at a seemingly random moment the performance here is also flawed for while the concerto grosso no 6 was actually written for the rozhdestvensky family i find their take on it less confident than that on bis where ralf gothoni conducts the tapiola sinfoniettathose new to schnittkes music would do better i think to start with two moscow studio archives discsthe firstcontains the concerto grosso no 1 and the cello concerto no 1 whilethe secondcontains the concerto grosso no 2 and the viola concerto and while fans of schnittkes late period may take offense at my low rating i can only call it as i see it and i invite those fans to explain what fascinates them in the late works in the comments here or a separate review|0
i dont normally write reviews but after reading some reviews before i downloaded this album i feel the need to write one  i think this is an outstanding album  i usually need to hear an album a few times before i really appreciate it and this one took me two listens to realize how outstanding it islet me start by saying this is a band that really needs to be in the rock n roll hall of fame  the music is excellent as usual  getty alex and neil have not lost a thing with their music  they are among the best musicians at their craft  i really enjoy the music on this album more than the previous two efforts  it is different but that is what all rush fans have come to appreciate with this band  some of my favorite music pieces are the anarchist caravan clockwork angels and carnies  they have a good drive and beat  the wreckers is a bit more of a medley but i really like it  i have read some reviews that really did not like the lyrics  let me say that i dont think they are on par with red barchetta or spirit of radio but that is not what this album is about  i think neil is showing his songwriting diversity  and lets face it classic songs are really hard to top and arent produced every day  i think the lyrics are very good but not outstanding  in all i find this album a very good listen and for the past week i have listened to it every night when i get home from work and on my way home  i think all rush fans can appreciate this album|1
i am so happy i found this album  ive always wanted this cd before i knew it existed  i love traditional irish dance music especially the fiddling  i generally dont like vocals in it though  and although the reels and jigs and hornpipes are all so well known finding a good cd of them is just so hard at least for me does every irish collection really need to have danny boy and whiskey in the jarthere isnt a bad song on this release  thank you to rounder records for saving these classic songs by some excellent musicians performances that may have otherwise been forgotten  i hope that more of these older recordings will be made available in the futureif you like irish music id have to imagine youll love this cd|1
this album is pure rush it ranks up there with the best they have put out  they are at the top of their game|1
i was disappointed in this cd looking for something more hardcore too much unison after all with a cover of volareacute how intense is it gonna getnot to totally trash this cd the singing is strong and a wall of sound from the acoustic guitars just not what i wanted|0
this album reflects vintage rush with alex tearing up the strings for a band that has been writting music for 35 plus years that still no how to rock|1
that anyone could present this music as a long lost schubert symphony and get away with it is amazing it serves as a reminder how hard it is for anyone to write a la schubert without simply stealing themes actually by schubert  what we have here is a motly heap of cut and pasted tidbits borrowed from various chamber works the wanderer fantasy and even winterreise perhaps the worst of it is the andante movement which brings together ripoffs from the great c major with what sounds like suspiciously like part of the andante from mendelssohns italian symphony which then grotesquely morphs into the wanderer theme perhaps we can look forward to a new mendelssohn symphony  at any rate schubert fans are advised not to waste your money|0
this was a great song  it summed up all of womens delimmas as to what to aspire  should i be alluring or should i have a clean refrig  except she sings it much better than i can say  all the tunes are great and all  the lyrics come home|1
buyer beware this out of print blue note disc is sold directly through amazon on cdr media the artwork and disc are low quality media which does not deserve a market price of 1400 you should pay that amount for a first run real cd a cdr is not the same quality and does not stand the test of time do not be swayed blue note should be ashamed to have allowed this to happen i did not read the fine print when i ordered and was under the impression that blue note had reissued this title bless don pullens estate he probably doesnt see a cent of the profits i love my cds but id rather download this as an mp3 and burn my own rather than fork over 1400 for a lousy bootleg decent artwork clever printed topside but it is not worthy of the musician it presents sorry|0
the songs are too simpel we need better songs it is good if you have radio and listen to we don need no education we have heard it several times please stop it|0
raffi is great childrens music when i ordered this set i thought it was a greatest hits collection so a little disappointed when it wasnt but still a good selection of his hit cds|1
i ordered a cd from grease 2 and received a rythem and blues cd instead and could not return it|0

it is extremely difficult to find a instrumental version of shenandoah to which this cd has  i personally hope that a civil war brass band will play this as an instrumental  a civil war folk song it has more meaning to those who are near the shenandoah mountains and river  in the native american indians translationit means daughter of starsthe ashokan farewell instrumental as is played there is no better to be found  i am of the belief that ken burns civil war will be forever linked to this musicthe rest of the music in my opinionis better played by the americus brass band and camp chase fife and drum corps  by using the authentic type drums it makes a huge difference on the entire recipe of the music pieceselectionif youre not fussy and not hungry for period instruments onlythen it would be a higher ranking|0
only tasteless people would buy this garbage look at its ranking its a really bad cd really bad|0
you really have to listen to the album as a whole to grasp its genius  once you do you realize just how incredibly produced and grand in scope this piece of art isalso some of you people need to learn what paragraph breaks are|1
i am reviewing the mp3 download because i no longer have a use for those bright shiny things discs there are plenty of song by song reviews on this album so i will tell you straight up get this if you love good ol rock n roll there are no surprises and nothing controversialpeople enough with the whining about wasted talent sexual or juvenile lyrics this is rock and roll  get over it you know what you get with sammy read his book hes been doing the same thing since the 70s with montrose and still sings bad motor scooter his first hit song if vh ever puts out a new album then will yall complain about daves juvenile and meaningless songs we know what we get with these guys and i embrace it as dennis green said they are who we thought they were you know sometimes you just want to jamjoe satriani is absolutely incredible and brings a broad scope of musicality to the songs he has so many styles in his arsenal and never seems to duplicate his music if i didnt know that satch wrote the music and played the guitar parts then i would never guess its him in some parts the guitar will remind you of evh  the dive bombs hammering and some heavy rhythms i am sure a conscious effort was made to avoid vh comparisons on the 1st album who cares joe is joe eddie is eddie and vai is better than both put togethermy favorite part of this band is the rhythm section mike anthony and chad smith these guys are rock solid and their grooves make you want to dance mike flourishes in this band having no trouble keeping up with satriani make no mistake were not talking about vai and sheehan but multiple levels above anthonys vh dayschad lays down some heavy beats that anchor this bands sound  just like a good drummer should i remember some sort of accident with chad on their first tour and the band delayed the tour until chad healed at the time i thought that was a nice gesture from his band mates the real reason is the guys knew the band is not the same without chad just like rush would never be the same without neil peartat the end of the day this album is not van hagar no its a stronger tighter and more diverse culmination of rockers having fun for a change take a page from their book buy the cd or download the 7 mp3 mix up some cabo ritas sit back and enjoy|1
at the risk of heresy this may be rushs best album ever im a big fan of their later work they have transformed from a prog rock band to a straightahead rock band their musicianship is astounding neil peart doesnt just keep time with the drums he shows off at every fill lifeson and lee sound like a welloiled machine these guys have been playing together for 40 years and it shows in a good waythe only concession to father timeis geddy lees voice which no longer sounds like helium man but this is a good thing not a bad thing there is no way to sing in that high register for 40 years just ask robert plant geddys vocal register sounds perfect for the type of music rush plays for a band thats been around 40 years rush doesnt sound like a bunch of old guys they sound energized and youthfulthe songs on this album are both melodic heavy and lengthy averaging about 5 minutes per song the production is excellent all the instruments are pushed well forward in the mix giving the album a depth and warm sound not common on cds these days|1
terrific voice  gifted artistand choice variety  of sacred music great for relaxing time  reading or meditating praying moments looking forward to seeing this artist perform soon in person you will love this cd if you like sacred music with guitar and various other instrumental background just know you will be blessed and pleased if you order this cd|1
incredibly good music from a pair of musicians obviously having complete mastery of their primary instrumentsthe two musicians have been working together since 1991 and obviously hit it off right away the very next yeara compilation album done by the pair was nominated for album of the year  according to music label empty seastudios the work behind the scenes for this album john hartford once commented on mikes playing that hedmastered bill monroe style of mandolin playing better than the father of bluegrass himself  very high praiseindeed from a highly competent musician himself  mr grier is no slouch either the winner of at least twogrammy awards  these obviously have been masters of their respective crafts for a long long time and thework they have done together since those first efforts in 1991 certainly well illustrates the seamless fluidity theyve grown to know in their work together since  it appears to this reviewer that the two almost flawlessly anticipate the efforts of the other in whatever type of music theyve chosen  right now this is oneof my favorite pieces of recorded music  in time im sure itll grow into the old friends and still favoritemusic of my old  in the way albums or little feat jonathan edwards or david grisman and friends including his many jam sessions with jerry garcia and then the work of british bands fairport convention andsteeleye span all totally familiar now after many years but still oh so enjoyable during the time listeningto them over all the years and still to this day along with so many more  what a wonderful hobby|1
i have probably seen holy grail 26 times the first one being the week it came out i get thrown out of parties doing python skits and singing python songs i may have just gotten kicked out of a theater cast by sending sit on my face to the director dont ask why i was riding this wagon long before it was being loaded up with the dead the problem is that after a point the pythons stopped being otherworldly and just started parodying themselves taking a joke too far is the essence of british comedy but taking it too loud or just milking suspense is the essence of poor timing monty python live were for those who think that words are enough timing and delivery are just the icing on the cake those who have never heard the original skits might love what is coming from the stage but when the laughter starts from the opening words the audience already knew the material and were ready to laugh at anything if that describes you this set half of which is from live at city center will be a fine one disc best of personally i cant stomach the live versions good jokes told badly are bad jokes ill stick with my vinyl versions of the original albums as inconvenient as they are to play and this disc goes out at my next yardsale the nonlive stuff rates five stars having to sit through amateur hour drops this way down|0
i agree with the other reviewers that hummels music here is excellent the problem for me is the performance notations for allegro vivace presto con spirito are all ignored these movements are played with a slow lifeless plodding deliberation another section marked andante is played at a snails pace one of the other reviewers mentioned a strolling pace this was for a movement marked allegro con spirito strolling while the first two quartets are more or less acceptable accent on the less the third is the worst the case states that these pieces were recorded over a three day period it sounds like they just ran out of steam by the third day its very frustrating listening to what should be lively fun exciting music played with such slow dullness to hear what hummels chamber music should sound like listen to the recordings of his piano trios piano quintets  septets|0
this is a great album from the masters of spaced out rock music but to me i was a little disapointed because i loved dark side of the moon and listening to the wall was not as enjoyable as dark side of the moon  there  are many great songs on this album but the are quite a few that arent so  great also  also this album doesnt have as great of a flow as dark side  of the moon  for new fans id recommend the more accesible dark side of  the moon first|1
this is yet another oldies cd that cant be fully recommended because not all of its tracks are the original versionssugar sugar one fine day im into something good and leader of the pack are definitely in their original formbut stand by your man little darling when a man loves a woman and save the last dance for me are definitely not the originals but are contemporary rerecordings by artists who are now 60 years old in some cases not all of the original band members are still alive and in the case of stand by your man it isnt even the tammy wynette version but some other country singer singing iti am not sure if the remaining two trackscherry hill park and silence goldenare original or not because i am not familiar with these songsthe sound quality of the cd is ok the bottom line is that if you want an inexpensive cd that contains any of the 4 original tracks listed above buy it if not be aware|0
i love myles kennedy as well as slash naturally i wanted to get this cd the playing style of slash just gels with the amazing vocals of myles kennedy i recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys killer musicians getting together and playing their tooshies off|1
miles and slash are a perfect match and the songwriting is at a very high level on this release i didnt care for slashs prior cd with the various vocalists but this one was a pleasant surprise this is hard rock done right with lots of energy soaring vocals and killer riffs the choruses and hooks get stuck in your head and you want to listen to it over and over there is not a bad track on hereand the extra tracks on the deluxe version are great tooif you like other great current rock bands like sixx am hardcore superstar and voices of extremethen you will like this if you liked guns n rosesthen you should like this unless you are hung up on axl being gonebut miles sounds great your loss|1
awesome musicenough said  if you like sammy hagar andor chickenfoot you wont be disappointed  i would recommend this cd  buy it|1
i enjoy classical music and wanted to reminisce a live performance i attended  stop the witless nonsense i havent got time for it|0
for the last few albums the innovators of rush have fallen into their own rut relying on too familiar melodic choices too much noise layering and overdub and often too many geddys backing geddy  nothing was terrible in the last few tries but nothing stood outbut thats changed nowwith the exception of a few small low points angels brings the aggression and hardness of counterparts the driving story of 2112 and enough catchy licks to invoke moving pictures and the other radio hits of the 80s  every listen takes me a little deeper and what music any more can really take you on a journey like thatthis band has always been tight but somehow they seem more together on this album like everyones heart is in the collaboration and on the same page  there is enough risk in the musical styles and lyrics to take rushs music to new places all the while retaining enough of the familiar power to say yes this is how rush must soundthe band has transcended again  and truly is better than everas the subject line of the review says if this was to be their last album its the right one for rush to go out on|1
only thing i didnt like was that both cds were scratched so badly i had to take them to be buffed out in a cd shop  cost me an extra 4 a cd  wouldnt buy from this company again|0
ok i love languages and one day i came accross the lakota language i simply fell in love with it and you will too the reviews here are quite confusing i bought from the llc lakota laguage consortium the text book 1 and the text book 2 and i bought the cds for each of these text books the text books are amazing and will teach you a great deal in my opinion they are the best teaching tools available the cds are really great companions to the text book as they teach you how to pronouce the words therefore it is a mistake to review the cds as stand alone if you have any doubt try text book 1 and cd 1 the content the work from the author mr jan ullrich is worth much more than these are sold forthe llc teaching text books and cds are definitively five star material i did try other books and method but nothing compares to the llcs i have just bought the new lakota dictionary see my review and the combination of the text book  cd  dictionay is simply the best material you can ask for in order to really learn lakhota|1
brian regans comedic style is his own unique invention his obsorvations are sharp and funny as hell the fact that he doesnnt have to use any curse words shows that hes a true comic genius if only there were more comics like him|1
i have listened to this album from front to back on spotify at least 5 times  i just cant get into it  the first track starts out very uninspired and it only gets worse from there  sammys obsession with sexually suggestive lyrics gets old  i was cool with it when he was in van halen and i was in my early 20s  now im near 40 and its lame  this is very generic rock  pales in comparison to the new van halen album  i even have a chance to buy this right now on amazon for 299 with credits and i cant bring myself to do it sorry chickenfootplease try harder|0
i always like anything slash is putting out  its always much better than you would think  miles voice gets on my nerves after a few songs|1
had previously owned broadway cast version on lp  compared to that recording songs on this one have less life and exhuberance or are overproduced  if amazon posted samples of hair where do i go or i got life or some others you could hear the overproduction more chorus and orchestra less spirit from the singer i bought this cd because of the great reviews on amazon for this version and accusations of bad production quality for the broadway cast version cd  this one also has a lot of nonmusical dialog which hurts the musical flow  i played this one once and havent played it since  ill go get the version i grew up with|0

this cd set is a must for all fans of lucille ball it not only has wonderfully suspenseful episodes of suspence how would you ever have guessed but it has radio plays of lucille balls classic movies such as fancy pants with the late great bob hope perhaps best of all this set contains episodes of balls 194751 radio show my favorite husband ball stars as liz cugatcooper in this series and liz was the prototype for lucy ricardocarmichaelcarterbarker in fact many of the episodes of my favorite husband were reworked into episodes of i love lucy if you havent heard my favourite husband or had the pleasure of listening to an installment of lux radio theatre buy this set today|1

was not what i was hoping for i wanted italian classics sung the classic way this was more modern and sung that way|0
listening to the kronos quartet playing schnittkes fourth quartet is purely an intellectual exercice in their seriousness they dont seem to capture the emotional spirit of the late composer compare it to the  intelligent emotional rendition of the fourth quartet by the alban berg  quartet dedicatee of the work and you will measure the ocean between  them kronos should smile for a change on another note  the cds  booklet is interesting and fun tooagain listen to the alternative alban berg quartet for the fourth and borodine for the third and the first the discovery is worth spending a bit more time and efforti recommend also the arditti string quartet sensitive and intelligent performance the schnittke second quartet is incredibly rich in colors the pulsation is always present the folk melodies underlying the rich texture are well defined and never forced the fourth movement is simply out of this worldthis performance shames the fashionable predictable mono dimensional kronos|0
the youth of america are accustomed to quick sound bytes and simple song structures they dont want to think about their music as they listen to it i believe this pertains to some of the newer rush fans who have negatively reviewed this brilliant album perhaps their add prevents them from focusing on the messages in this concept album who knows my advice is to take the time to sit and listen to the music while reading the lyrics read what other fans have interpreted from their own listening experiences rush spent the time and effort to evolve as a group and present something that should please most fans you should give them the same consideration|1
bought this for my husband as a christmas gift and he loved it  great price as well  songs by sammy hagar and crew are very good as well recommend for any sammy hagar fans|1
cd casing was broken apart in shipment item was poorly protected not even wrapped internally this would easily have fit in a small post office mailing box but noooo  they had to use a paper envelope instead i paid nearly 12 for this and all i got was an item in pieces the cd wont even play since it has scratches on it as well i want my money back|0
as some listeners have noted this cd is a glimpse into the brilliant virtuosity of african percussionist and xylophonist bernard woma the man is in a class by himselfunfortunately this cd is poorly recorded and mastered even worse the sound quality obscures whats going on with the music any of bernards other cds are much much better  and if you want a great live performance buy bernard woma in concert i dont know if its on amazon yet but search in google and you can easily buy itsomeone here wrote that the problem with this pito bar cd is that it was a bootleg which would explain it and give another big reason to pick up a better cd by this great artist|0
if you enjoy pink floyd youwill love this emotional rollercoaster of hate fear love confussion and pride this is a 2 thumbs up 5 star extravaganza and i hope you enje it as much as me|1
i purchased this album hoping this would be a mellowmusical tribute to the art and music of the worlds greatest vocalist what i got was a lengthyhard to listen toimprovisational roller coaster ride that made me  dizzy wheres the celebration if you came in to listen in the middle of  any of the 13 cuts you wouldnt identify any as a sinatra  tune if youre a fan of freeformimprov jazz you might like it i came  away duped and very disappointed i guess for real sinatra  there isnt or will there ever bethe real thing other than the  chairman just dont look in here to capture that magic|0
this album sucks it has two songs on the entire album and they are get money and players anthem they are only hot because big is on them even big admitted when he was alive that junior mafia wasnt hungry when you arent hungry you dont make good music  the lyrics are weak and they have subpar beats i hope they never make another album|0
you may want to buy this if you are interested in the development of modern folkloric music and it may be enjoyable to listen to if you dont know the languages being sung  however if you know spanish portuguese or italian i wouldnt recommend it  i find it disconcerting that the lyrics are not set to the music according to the natural rhythm of the words  it seemed an interesting but ultimately failed experiment at crosscultural pollination a mishmash rather than a harmony  for me this album certainly didnt live up to the rave reviews of previous reviewers|0
well it doesnt get much worse than this  i guess there was no way to go but up from this point there is a lot of music that is worth going back in time for  this isnt it|0
the wall has to be one of the best albums of all time the concept is just completely genius and makes you think about what each song actually means the music has a very sonic spacey atmosphere and is a pleasure to listen to especially david gilmours brilliant guitar work and best of all it is filled with classic timeless songs sure the introludes do get anoying but because of the albums concept even they mean something in the story best song is young lust great song for driving around in the city at night i recommend this album to any rock fan|1
you can tell when a band is not a band they sounds like individuals playing at different times and its obvious yes at this time there will be no more guns n roses but at least they sounded like a band|0
this album like the rest of garths collection is over rated for the most part i respect his position and his fame but when i listen to this album and others and i reminded that he is a commercial creation and not a talented artiststhere is not a single song on this album that stays  with you after listening to it i really expected better of him tim mcgraw  is more heart and soul country  garth tries but it falls flatunlike  elvis whose early tracks such as on sun records are classics early garth  is not much better than later garthim sorry but this album is a let  down|0
its amazing after so many years and so many albums these three guys can still produce great music  i highly recommend the album|1
i already have plenty of vangelis and jarre music and thought that this  compilation  tribute might make an interesting addition to the collection  i should have saved my money  the recordings all sound like somebody  typed a brief description of the relevant vangelis or jarre selection into  a sequencer and then went out for coffee while the synthesier cranked out  the bits  utterly uninspired performances of everything completely  lacking in the fire and verve that made the originalssome of the best  electronic  newage music|0

the age old question which is a better album dark side of the moon or the wall  i think you have to be the judge of that yourself but they are both excellent albums posibly the two greatest everthe wall stands out  for its story artwork movie and certain songs  one of the few  rock operas  it tells the story of pink a rock star who  eventually goes crazy from buliding up a wall  the story is  outstanding frightening and interesting  by seeing the movie you really  are able to understand the entire album for at times it is difficult  one  of the negitive parts of this album is its darkness and ability to depress  someone the move is also somewhat responsible for this too when i listen  to dark side of the moon im reminded of the wizard of  ozthe majority of the songs on the wall are very good some classics  greats include another brick in the wall pt ii  mother young lust goodbye blue skies  hey you comfortably numb and run like  hell  other good songs that arent recognized enough are both of the  in the flesh waiting on the worms  the  trial and another brick in the wall pt i  the rest of  the album is just mediocre where dark side of the moon doesnt  have the interesting concept the the wall does it makes up for  it in its nine fabulous songs which all are classics  the music on  dsotm is better than the wall and really what all  bands are doing is making music not a play or a story  that is why i  believe dark side of the moon is a better album  if you feel any different  and would like to express your opinions plesase email me  but why  bicker just get both of them and enjoy|1
my favorite is the garden  that is rush at its best in all aspects both musically and in lyrics that solo is amazingly sweet  a must have|1

without a doubt the finest version of fantasia on christmas carols is found on 1993 hyperion recording conducted by mathew best  and the wilcox version of hodie done in the 60s while sonically inferior is still the gold standard for this lovely and underrated piece  there are also numerous other versions of the fantasy out there which are good and can be had for a low price  the treatment of both pieces here is solid but i think there are better ones to be found|0
this is an incredible album that will have you laughing and laughing for as long as you own it  brian regans humor is so universallisten to the first few samples and you can get a sense of what this guy has to offer  you will be having long belly laughs over many of his bits  i shared it with a group of coworkers and they all became immediate fans also  like many have said hes even better if you can go see him livethe facial expressions the mannerismshe is just a funny funny man with a funny funny album|1

if you are looking  for an authentic presentation of civil war music this is not it  i was hoping for something that was at least close to the traditional sounds of the songs not so with this cd i will seriously  doubt any other historical presentations by the mtc|0
although the division bell 94 is a great piece of music momentary lapse misses roger waters sorely gilmour attempts to imitate waters bitterly ironic and clever lyrics  a big mistake as dogs of war will show learning to fly is a very nice song and on the turning away sounds great indeed the rest of the album however is the sound of a band with no direction probably because it was mostly played by studio musicians  rick wrights playing is missed do yourself a favor and make this the last addition to your floyd collection|0
one hour six minutes and four seconds   10604i will admit that the first time i listened to clockwork angels i didnt love it  but as with any masterpiece it does take time to understand  digest  quantify i just returned from an 11 hour van ride with 10 college age kids that are used to listening to pop  country and assorted musical fluff  i played clockwork angels in a loop the whole trip and never once did they complain and some actually began to understand after following the journey from the caravan to the garden  you will see that peart is truly a master story teller and the lifeson  lee orchastration is excellenti personally feel this is the best album of their career|1
this collection is a very good primary source record for the songs which would otherwise be inaccessible however some background is helpful but two thirds of it is background noise also the musicians and the musicianship leaves a lot to be desired these are average amateur performers i am in an early music group and were a lot better than these guys|1
much better than the radio teaches rhyming and the songs are so cute i had this on cassette for my children and bought the cd for my grandson|1

everyone knows about the wall as the 3 best selling album of all time it certainly deserves its placethis album is a somewhat introspective journey through the psyche of the worn out rocker pink the loss of his father in ww2 before he ever really knew him his overbearing mother the loss of his wife to another man the drugs and the too much too soon situation he is in all compound into figurative wall that shields the real him from outside influences and keeps the real him from being seen inside this wall he loses his sanity one step at a time until finally he retreats into a fantasy world where an imaginary judge finds him guilty of showing feelings and sentences him to be exposed by all his peersbut on the outside of this wall things are very different pink becomes something of a nazi in that hes extremely prejudiced and takes advantage of his fans he becomes exactly what his father fought against and it is after this that the trial begins in his fantasy worldthe album climaxes with the wall falling down and pink being exposed as the scared scarred and confused man he really iswhile this album isnt pink floyds best work it is their most mainstream and best selling one it is a definite must for any floyd fan and a great starting point for those just getting into it do yourself a favor buy this one today|1
the remastering is excellent i was shocked the package is gorgeous also compared this to the 2006 american and still sounds more cleaned up wow that being said its not mixed at all the vocals are completely on one side and the drums on the other again its not mixed at all rubber soul is at least slightly mixed i have to change my original review mix the album as it was never meant for stereo anyway the beatles never partaked in the mixing and it was never meant to be released as a stereo record per george martin the arrogance of these people i thought the music is for a new generation of listeners at first listen it does sound amazing but then i realized it wasnt mixed at all anyone who tells you differently is special purchase the mono box and get blown away with a proper mix you also wont get errors that werent meant to be there for example track 2 on a hard days night the harmonica has a mistake on it when john runs out of breath track 3 pauls voice cracks yes they kept these mistakes in for the stereo records isnt that great when you listen to the mono you get correct mixes as well as no left right vocals and drums problems hard days night still sounds amazing but these problems should have been mixed out|0
she is good she is talented but unless you grew up with her and can see the skits in your head its not worth iti remember seeing her when i was young but i wanted a cd that i didnt have to imagine seeing i want to listen and laugh and with thisi just didnt|0
the wall is one of rocks finest hours this is the ultimate nihilistic psychedelic breakdown album this is infinitely superior to tommy musically and lyrically the album should only be listed to in its entirety  listening to the songs out of order prevents one from following pink as he descends into absolute insanity like a modern day version of kafkas joseph k pink gradually recedes from reality until he finds himself in a freudian nightmare of neuroses  david gilmores guitar work shines on this album and roger waters voice sounds the best of his career|1
our children learned these songs when they were young in the 80s  now my 17 month old grandson is learning the songs  my daughter always sings the brush your teeth song to him when he brushes his teeth  i played the song for him and he wanted to go brush his teeth and then take a bath as is the routine  ill have to learn them again to sing to him|1
i have been a rush fan since 1974 clockwork angels is one of the best right up there with 2112 and a farewell to kings  my first time listening i was really turned off by geddy lees singing over the years he has went from standard rock belt it out to actual singing  clockwork angels he is singing like a song bird he holds notes is very melodic  so you have rush at its very best with the music just beautiful mixed timing just a fest for my ears but then geddy is singing took three times listening to the entire album for me to recognize hey he is kind of good  but the singing did distract from the instrumentation these guys are masters beyond masters lets say artistoh well what else can i say just buy it in twenty years they will still be playing this on the radio progressive rock is like thatfavorite songs the garden and headlong flight the garden is just beautiful lyrics are amazing you may need to be in your 50s to appreciate it though|1

shame on me for ignoring the 19 1 comments and being swayed by the 259 5 comments  i am totally nonplussed how 259 reviewers could give this product a 5 rating  please consider another source if you expect to listed to the nostalgic beatles songs listed in the amazon product description  this is not a true audio cd or at least it does not perform like one  grassroots books should have included appropriate caveats regarding this type cd media  other than that i agree with most of the negative reviews already posted for grassroots cds|0
as far as everyone knows this was a good cd some of the songs just rambled along but it was good the transaction and purchase was well performed|1
this is not worth your money do not waste it on this horrible version of les miserableslets start out with the one and only good thing about it jean valjean colm wilkinson will and always will be in my opinion the best jean valjeanhowever the rest of the cast were terrible they did no justice to the great music and story thenardier was very funny but did not have the same intensity as the one on the 10th anniversery editioni could not stand to hear fantine butcher i dreamed a dream that after the first two lines i skipped the trackeponine was even worse her voice is like fingernails on a blackboard she ruined my favorite song on my own and had the same mercy for her other songsjavert was bland boring and did not have the depth the character required marius was just the samevery boring and not emotional at allcosette was not very interestingbut then again shes not a very interesting characterif you want a good recording of les mis buy the 10th anniversery edition it has what this recording severely lacks|0

i have a tap as well but i never let it run for an hour|0
received the disc a few days ago and have already listened to it about 10 times this album is awesome sure there are some songs i like better than others but name me one album where that is not the case overall i would highly recommend this cd even if your just a little bit skeptical from other reviews at least give it a chance|1
the other day i realized with some disbelief that i had never heard the wall in its entirety  sure ive heard the hits but id never been exposed to the complete work  so i went out and bought it  needless to say i am  in awe of it  i think it is a stunning achievement and while i am not  pink floyds number one fan i have gained some tremendous respect for them  and a new appreciation of them by listening to the wallthis is such a  deep and multilayered album that even several listenings will not reveal  its true depth  like a profound work of literature or a great symphony  the wall is challenging provocative and compelling  i think it  represents everything rock music is capable ofi also bought the movie  on dvd  while it is not a perfect movie it is certainly a fascinating  work  bob geldof is terrific in the lead role the cinematography and  animation are dazzling and the story is really is quite movingim glad  i discovered this great album 20 years after it came out|1
just wanted to let you know that your two previous reviewers are being kind when they talk about the bad sound quality when horrendous would be the better word for this boxed set i bought this for 499 at a used cd store back in about 1990 but picked it up because it sounded like a supreme bargain to be getting 5 cds for 500 but with the terribly boomy bass and atrocious treble response of these cds i had to ditch this set quickly so i took it to one of our pawn shops in town and sweet talked the lady owner and told her how revered and great this beethoven boxed set was i was lying through my teeth because i needed to get rid of it that she agreed to buy it for about 899 i got more for it than i paid for it and could just finally be rid of this disaster of a set once and for all even when a performance and interpretation is superb sometimes its hard to tell when the sound is this bad these performances are definitely nothing to write home about and i think ill just stick to krips mozart and schubert they far surpass this set in every conceivable way and are just a delightful listen so just stay away from this set because there are so many other sets of the complete beethoven symphonies like zinman harnoncourt cluytens jochum szell klemperer and at least four different boxed sets by karajan if this ever is back in print at least i think its out of print they would definitely need to give this a super remastering to make it a little more attractive for buyersps tlin who has the review after mine on april 19th must have been listening to some other complete set because hes definitely off his rocker to give such a glowing review on this atrocious krips effort i dont know if he has a new and better recorded issue but if hes talking about the box set that is pictured on this entry hes not a very good judge of classical music or has extremely bad taste but believe me about not buying this because of the terrible sound quality sometimes terrible sound quality is a dealbreaker when youre considering a purchase and when there are infinitely better recorded sets out there why even mess with this krips set even if this was a superb interpretation and well played it wouldnt be worth purchasing until they remaster it well and clean it up kind of like they did with szells brahms symphonies 2 and 3 which in its previous incarnation sounded so terrible but when it was astonishingly remastered in the late 90s it ended up sounding better than the best ddd recordings unless something like that happens with this beethoven krips set just leave this one alone|0
great music great concept albumjust amazing work from a sadly aging bandthis is the first in a while that is a coherent and complete cd from start to finish in the vein of 2112just amazing work im so glad i spent the money on it|1
the party seen in steerage with galic storm playing the irish diddlyd music where rose and jack danced togheter was one of the musical hightlights of the movie yet was not included on the soundtrack  when i hear some of the songs that replaced it i cant help but wonder who made that decision  i had to buy gaelic storms cd to hear the song  i was pleasently suprised as the entire cd was fantastic so this soundtrack being so bad turned me onto another good one  i guess thats why it got at least 1 star|0
my prior experiences with this type of music is that it is nice and relaxing with calming songs and nature sounds  this cd however is not very relaxing  the music is more along the lines of nature sounds with fantasia music so it has a lot of ups and downs  i was hoping for something more along the lines of bach for relaxation and the sounds of rainfall and birds|0

the new chickenfoot cd rocks best songs are different devil come closer and something going wrong rock on sammy hagar and the rest of the band|1
this is what ive been waiting for everything about this album is fantastic the flow of the songs and the fact that this is a concept album by rush is incredible being a long term fan of the band its nice to see the direction their going while still staying true to themselves this is what the band has always been about doing what they love and sharing it with the world|1
the sound is awful  one cannot hear the words music is tinny  this is not worth ordering on cloud player|0
it has been brought to my attention by the people who left comments that the review i wrote lacked good judgement and taste it is one thing to say you dont like something but to be rude and belligerent is wrong nevertheless i still do not like the band and therefore i wont raise the amount of stars i gave at first but  i do detract the words appalling and vacuousfans of the band please forgive me for being rudethe original review is belowthe four and one half star rating of this album is beyond me  the music is substandard the singer appalling and the lyrics vacuous if you are looking for a femalefronted metal band buy tristania epica after forever or within temptation  this is a fly leaf from a horrible book|0
i bought this cd based on the positive reviews of others but am totally underwhelmed this is my fourth banks solo cd i also have bankstatement a curious feeling and still not to mention the entire genesis catalog  and theres nothing on strictly inc that hasnt been done better on another disc and quite frankly thats part of the problem strictly inc is just more of the same material that has been reformulated and regurgitated if youre into prog like me youre going to be disappointed in this quasipop mishmash of forgettable tunes theres nothing here even as remotely catchy as the opener to still red day on blue street|0
this cd sucks from start to finish for the reason i cant get it out of my head  i will be in important meetings and i cant get the guitar solos from dogs to stop running through my head  in fact i can play the whole albumcd from start to finish in my head to a tee  thus i cant pay attention to anything being said  two stars well i guess i meant 5  i feel that this is the pink floyd at their best each song flowing into the next the best guitar work i feel from gilmour  an album with balls floyd made this knowing that it would not be getting any radio time at all no hits  yet they released it making the music they wanted to not caring about critics etc  if you didnt want to listen to it then they didnt want you too  the perfect mesh between waters at the helm of the concept and gilmour making the music for it  the way floyd was supposed to be at their best regarless of what was going on in the band at the time i feel that musicaly this is at their prime each member knew their part  music before the pre waters solo works of the wall and final cut  and after wish you were here and darkside  what more can i say  not only my favourite floyd album but my favourite album ever bar none never gets old always in my cd changer|0
this is probably the best album ever released i love every song  ive been a huge fan since 2005 and have been wanting to buy it since then by the time i got a job i was in high school when the album was released and could buy the song the second album was the only one on the selves in stores i bought that one and highly recommend that as well i was against buying digital songs for a long time but ive gotten over it this past year and im glad i did worth every penny|1
the sound and playing are fine but the tempos are so fast that it sounds as if the conductors on speed  the fast tempos completely miss the beauty of the pieces  extremely disappointing unless youre a speed freak avoidid have rated this a 1 starhate it except for the sound the playing and the performance of the 6th my least favorite brandenburg but better than some ive heard|0
what a travesty  mehtas insipid reading of the 1st coupled with the szell is bad enough  to not include all of the szell makes this an alsoran  hopefully sony will eventually realize their mistake and reissue the szell perhaps as part of the heritage masterworks series in cleanedup sound|0
this was to be the beatles last album together realeased in 1970 this was a horrible ending for a great career let it be is the 2nd worst beatles album in my opinionplease please me being the worst it seemed to me like the beatles were just writing and not caring if it sounded good or not the only decent track on this album is the long and winding road othere than that i think this was just a waste of time and money|0
i love christine lavin one of my favorite folk singers of all timethis is one of my favorite albums one that i keep on my favorites mp3 list its honest touching a bit wistful and very sweet in spots it doesnt have a lot of the humor of some of her albums its a lovely showcase of what this very talented singersongwriter can dofavorite tracksthe first track is very funny its about a lot of things she doesnt like but she pretends to like because she does like the man she does them with there is also a parody of this song if you can find it by tom smith which she adds vocal to called i wish i couldnt read her mindbumblebees is a very sweet song about finding love unexpectedly in a friendmysterious woman is about wishing she were more exotic more mysteriousi like the whole album and recommend it without hesitation to people who like folk music or are just getting started listening to folk|1
imagine if you will for a second that let it be had been released by a band other than the beatles  lets call the band ordnance  the surveys  now let it be is ordnance  the surveys debut recording and it is released in 1970 when heavy rock and progressive music rules the chart  ordnance  the surveys album is a ramshackle collection of inconsequential jams interspered with the occasional  yes thats occasional  moment of songwriting mastery  the title track is wonderful as is across the universe  the long and winding road is marred by overproduction but is nevertheless listenable and get back is a palatable single  ordnance  the surveys album is badly produced and woefully out of touch with the trends of the time  except let it be was actually released by the beatles a band almost universally regarded as the greatest in the world and critics and fans mourning their demise heaped praise on a record which taken as a whole album can only really be described as average  four good songs do not a great album make  when oh when will people learn that its ok to dislike some of the beatles output  i happen to be unmoved by a quite significant part of the fab fours work  prior to their alleged tendency to ingest certain psychedelic drugs they were a disposable pop group  if revolver sgt peppers    magical mystery tour the beatles and abbey road constituted the brilliant druginduced high then let it be represents the comedown  messy unpalatable and embarrassing|0
this cd was surprisingly better than  i thought it would be it was really good|1
this album contains so many classics it would take a 10000 word essay to do it justice the songwriting and musicianship are excellent gilmores lead playing is brilliant and waters vocal delivery on songs like the thin ice is classic my favs are another brick in the wall mother goodbye blue sky young lust hey you is there anybody out there vera comfortably numb and run like hell i used to listen to this album before going to bed when i was a college student the only problem was that its 1 12 hours long so i would end up going to bed late and sleeping through my classes|1
if you want one of those rare cds that you can listen to all the way through without having to skip to the good tracks then this cd is for you every song on this cd is a potential single on the radio great heavy guitar riffs excellent deep lyrics and a female voice to blow your socks off you cant go wrong with this cd buy it now|1
i line foreign exchange but some of the language is strong i love the instumental cd it is a work of art|0
from the very first bars i couldnt get over the feeling of absolute wrongness about the wole thing the sound seems to come out of a cavernous and heavily reverberant blackness and lacks the warm intimate spirituality  that kna was famous for act 1 is a writeoff neatly summarized in the  grandiose and selfindulgent transformation scene the recording fares  better as the work progresses though norman is the reason to get this  set as domingo one of the better voices in the title role amounts to  nothing more than a curiousity dramatically moll is good but was in  better surroundings with karajan get either of knappertbuschs or go to  karajan or solti|0
i believe alan is the best banjo player around festival favorites revisited is a fascinating look at some of the traditional bluegrass parking lot favorites there are a number of twists and turns both in style and tunings making it a a very intersting ride through the classics whether youre a picker or not you owe it to yourself to add this munde recording to your collection|1
this and dark side of the moon are my two favorite albums of all time  incredible lyrics by roger waters stunning guitar solos by david gilmour and some of the best vocals ever  also great job richard wright we will miss you and nick mason  check on remember that night dvd  an absolute must have in your pink floyd  david gilmour collection  this was richard wrights last tour|1
the cd i received for this was defective in that it was only partially recorded i wrote 2 emails to the provider bluesky and i never received a reply back i am therefore left with a useless cd and am out my money i am not sure that i feel comfortable about ordering from amazon in the future and will certainly never order anything from bluesky again|0
it may be by various artists but which various artists  theres absolutely no information on the artists or the recording years on the cd  theres just the one sided card the picture you see above as the insert   most of the tracks seem done by one group thats totally instrumental the last couple tracks by one that uses a vocal chorus  most of the tracks sound fine technically but the last track sounds horribly muffled as if transferred from a 42nd generation tape copy  if youre not going to care what artists you put on a disk why use such a horribly mangled track madacy  and finally all the tracks are rather lacking in inspiration  if you want a tijuana brass knockoff on cd with at least some redeeming values search out one of the 4 mexicali brass cds instead|0

this has to be one of the worst live recordings i have heard in a long time i have others from the 78th frasers and all the others are top notch this recording or mixing is just flat almost like someone used a hand held recorderthis group deserves top shelf recordings but this is not it|0
i ordered this recording by mistake the gardiner zauberflote which i wanted and eventually got was pictured so that was what i thought i was getting  i returned this one unopened  having heard sound clips on the net especially the dreadful soprano edita gruberova i had no intention of even giving it a try|0

this comedy cd is a true treasure  i have bought several to give to my friends  relatives  his good clean comedy passes the grandma test easily but is so funny everyone laughs together  i shared it with 2 fellow health care professionals they loved it and have decided to recommend it to patients to help them lift their moods  you cant not laugh at so many of his routines here  i hope brian will come out with a dvd of this and other routines  brian regan is a heavenly gift to all of us who love to laugh but hate the blue language too many comics resort to in their routines|1

forget about wishing them well another jumbled mess geddy quit singing so high youre voice doesnt sound good high anymore yet a few good songs on the albumthe garden and the wreckers are keepers the rest throw aways tis a shame cuz there are some good parts in practically every song but now now taken as a wholethats another story thats where the word lame comes to mind take the beginning of carnies for instance i swear if that doesnt sound like a sixty nine dollar zoom pedal from musicians friend i dont know what does yet the chorus on that song isnt half bad very begining of seven cities of goldnot badthe rest of itbarf city and that hyped up title track clockwork angels dissapointed me the most cant stand it when bands include old crap caravan bu2b on new albums geddy you really should listen to a few billy joel albums before you go about writing the next album you know just to keep you from straying too far from what a melodic song should sound like or even better pull out some of your own albums anything before presto would do fine im gonna say it again fire that producer he isnt helping at all i recently listened to slashs new album and thought it was produced very well even though i didnt care for the music all that much you should see about getting that person to produce your next album if terry brown is not available in summary a couple of new rush songs to add to my collection but once again i get that feeling of dread that rush has come and gone with another crappy album|0
for those of you who do not read spanish let me give you the essence of the glendale review and add a few comments of my own  yes monna bell was a great singer  her diction was impeccable listen to doris day in english  or to monna bell in spanish and you will understand every single word of  every single song  she also had days knack for exquisite phrasing and  she was lucky enough to work with people like gregorio garcia segura at the  beginning of her career a collaboration which produced the classics aun te  sigo amando and silencio corazon  if you can find her hispavox now emi  recordings of the 19591965 period do not hesitate to pay top dollar for  them  they are worth every pennyas far as this monstrosity is  concerned i can only but agree with glendale and confirm that orfeon  records is the worst record label in the history of recorded sound second  only to sister company montilla records with whom it shares its well  earned infamous reputation among record collectors for decades they have  been preying on downontheirluck artists and unsuspecting fans they have  thus amassed an extensive catalog of latin music greats like nati mistral  lucho gatica bola de nieve perez prado alfredo kraus olga guillot  esther borja dolores perez and dozen others  an orfeon release will  definitely guarantee you the following  1 the worst sound possible 2  the worst packaging and art work possible 3 the worst production and  engineering possible  you can always count on orfeons lack of quality  its a given  they will never dissapoint you when it comes to taking your  money and runningthe very sad thing here is that the artists in  orfeons roster are the best that our culture has to offer  there will  never be another alfredo kraus  yet his orfeon releases are unlistenable  ditto for monna bell and the others  i must stress here that it is never  the performers who stink but the record label with its nofrills approach  to its producti pray for the day when orfeon records will go broke  andor will be bought by an enterprising company who will remaster its  entire catalog and give it to the consumer in acceptable sound and  packaging  until then all we can do is stay away from anything that bears  the orfeon or montilla logo and in the case of many of these artists monna  bell included turn to their output for other labels as an alternative to  their orfeon tragedymy best wishes to monna bell wherever she may be  and my deepest felt thank you to this wonderful chilean singer for  providing me with so many hours of listening pleasure  i also offer her  and her fellow orfeon alumni my sincerest condolences and my heartfelt  sympathy for ever having crossed paths with this abomination of a record  company|0

stan samole is one hell of a guitar player but thats where it ends i have spent time listening to all three releases they were gifts and i can honestly say that besides musical playing talent there is not much here past that most songs sound the same and dont feel very inspired did you ever listen to mike bloomfeild  not that samole sounds anything like him but there is a link mike bloomfeild was an amazing guitarist but no one bought his records because he could not write a song to save his life i am not saying samole is that bad but same ball park think of a brian eno minimalist record played on guitar with no inspiration and you are getting pretty closeif you are a guitarist starting out and have dreams of playing jazz this might be for you just dont cover any of the songs i met samole and all he went on about was phil collins being a no talent bum i guess he never heard trick of the tail or any brand x records phil in his hey day could play rings around samole and he can write songs to|0
guilmour cant write i admit learning to fly is good and on the turning away is a treat but the rest of this is crap dogs of war is guilmours horrible attempt at topping waters songs on the final cut floyds best album it sounds like genisus posibly the worst classic rock band ever i dont care what anyone says this was not pink floyd although the title does fit it well if you think about it|0
i purchase the wrong style of music i got the cassette instead of the cd i have to return it for the cd|0
through recommendations from several guides on classical music i got to listen to this record and of course the music itself is glorious truely delightful and all of that as long as you stay focused on the slow parts you have no trouble appreciating this record the problem starts when the more vigorous parts set in then it is revealed that the nice moderato slows are combined with much too fastly played quick tempi the same can be said about the 3 last symphonies by the same composer conducted by karajan in the double decca versioni didnt expect this to happen with rostropovich here because of the good reviews but also because of his russian roots i would have thought he was well able to convey the true russian feeling in this work sadly enough it really just is a very badbalanced piece of playing which is not to be accounted on the bpo but as haitink once said there are no bad orchestras just bad conductorsim afraid this here is the case with this recording rostropovich is likely to be better off with cello concertos playing or conducting  for a fine example check out his first recording with korean prodigy hanna changfor a better choice of tsjaikovskys masterpieces id go for previn and the lso emi or karajan and the vpo in his younger years on decca youd be much more satisfied|0
i had an opportunity to listen to this album in its entirety through napster and its one of the reasons i am grateful for such a service indeed there are some songs on it that are worth listening and owning in the ancient time is a nice choral work for instance and cailleachs whisper i could enjoy too but the majority of them really dont help the album much some have a nice beginning but end up yielding a cheap celtic sound that comes accross like an imitationthere are far more interesting albums and artists to explore if youre into this genre lorenna mckennit reigns supreme you got clannad as well specially old clannad enya who came from clannad and a number of windham hill acts nightnoise among them then of course you got sinead oconnor i guess my point is if you want irish shoot for the best dont settle for less than that|0
i have loved brian regans stand up ever since i saw his first stand up special on comedy central i appreciate the fact he can be funny without feeling like he needs to swear every other wordthis cd is really funny i love to listen to it at work the big yellow one is the suni just wish there were more audio cds besides this one for me to listen to at work|1
not many tracks considering the price people need to get into perspective that this is just an over rated band the most over rated in history i would argue certainly some amazing songs especially the ballads but no where near worthy of the best band ever title all these songs have been flogged and there is a smell of cashing in about these remastered albums|0

one of the best albums ever another brick in wall part 2 is good but its too main stream i like part 3 of another brick in the wall betteran almost all the songs r good stuff on this album i dont like the final cut because that sounds like junk but rest r worth gettingim 30 an always liked pink floyd because rite back i was a kid i remember hearing em all the time same with the beatles an frank zappa i grew up liking emanyway enuff bout past but there are other good bands too but this one will always be one of me number 1 favorite same with frank zappatoo me i dont care about other people options i think most 90s an today music r terrible like nickel back linkin park jay z ja rule slipkont etc most of todays hard rock etc an hip hop r garbagehip hop rap and rnb are ok like their arent bad for background music in my work but their never good enuff for me too buy any of their albums an listen too at my home or in my car|1
these performances are completely inaccurate and the poorest representation possible of these pieces  a cd of these performances would make a better clock and a vinyl edition would be much better heated in the oven and shaped into a plant pot|0
i love chickenfoot  since their inception ive been a fan  the first album was a great rock album but with iii they foot has hit a home run it totally rocks what i really noticed about this album was how much tighter of a band these guys have become  theyve gotten to know each other and theyve really stepped it up lyrically and musically from the last album  not saying the first wasnt amazing but iii shows a greater unityso why should you buy this album  first how can you go wrong with the awesome vocals of sammy hagar the brilliant guitar work of joe satriani the thumping bass of michael anthony and the hardhitting drumbeats of chad smith you cant pure and simplethe second reason the great musicianship and songwriting abilities of sammy joe mike and chad  these guys are masters of their craft the vocals are perfect with michael anthonys backing vocals brought out more  joe has written some great guitar parts and chad and mike have done wonders with the rhythm section  the lyrical content of this album has taken a more somber tone especially on tracks like different devil and three and a half letters the latter is an awesome song although i was skeptical at first when id first learned about it  but it works and it is terrific  youll know what im talking about when you give it a listenwhen sammy came out saying that the second album would be called iii i thought he was jumping the gun  i thought that maybe he was being a little egotistical he was  but rightly so because iii is worthy of its title this album will rock you from top to bottomsome of my stand out tracks are alright alrighta rockin song with a great chorus you will catch yourself air guitaring and air drumming different devila slower track but the lyrics are awesome and so are the instrumentals big footif youve heard this first single and werent sold instantly you need to take a listen again its a great song three and a half lettersits a different kind of song with mostly spoken word but its very powerful something gone wrongone of the best tracks on this album it has a really interesting feel at the beginningi honestly think anyone would be crazy not to give this album a listen  i love that these classic artists are still around  as a 19 year old i missed all of these guys heydays but im glad i have the opportunity to hear new music from these old artists with their first album in 2009 to this one i hope these guys stay around as chickenfoot for a long timewhile youre in a cd buying mood you should also check out sebastian bachs kicking  screaming the red hot chili peppers of which chickenfoot drummer chad smith is drummerim with you and night rangers somewhere in california  keep the faith my friends and happy listening|1
i agree with rodney  the sound of christmas is a wonderful album  my objection is with this cd itself  most of the tracks are acceptably captured on this cd however ave maria track 09 and the subsequent medley track 10 are garbled my guess is one of the 1960sera master tapes from which this cd was generated has some degredation  these were originally tracks 01 and 02 on side b of the vinyl which wouldve presented at the start of a new master tape so someone probably carelessly storedormishandled the outeredge of the master in the years since  oh well|0
im a big fan of satriani and hagar i was so excited when the first chickenfoot was about to come out but it turned out to be a huge disappointment and this album is no different its like all the talents dont merge very well all the songs sound like demos id recommend to listen to it via youtube or other source before buying it|0

the adventures of robin hood complete film score by erich wolfgang korngold and performed by the moscow symphony orchestra is the most magnificent rendition of this remarkable hauntingly beautiful music complete is the key word here as the moscow symphony performance has not edited the score for time considerations  john morgan of marco polo classic film music series has restored bars of music previously taken out and returned to the original full orchestration the score deserves dont buy this old almost tinny recording when an infinitely better rendition awaits youit is available through amazon play the previews and hear the differencethe adventures of robin hood film scorecomposed by erich wolfgang korngoldperformed by moscow symphony orchestraconducted by william t stromberg|0

to me the wall is the second best album of all time with mellon collie and the infinite sadness ahead by a tiny bit the isnt really just an album its one large song you cant listen to this to this  album without listening to the whole album its that great when i first  got this album i knew of pink floyd but wasnt really a big fan of them  my sister had pink floyds relics and i thought that it was  pretty good and so i bought this album i started listening to it and i  couldnt stop listening like how you cant put down a book on the first  day i got it i listened to this album three times in a row ive listened  to it at least one time through every day since then its that great the  lyrics are some of the best ive ever heard the music go on in the  background is wonderful im not a huge fan of guitar solos although  occasionally i can enjoy them but all the solos in this album really speak  to you and actually improve the song if you dont have this album i  advise you to go out and buy it today you really wont regreat it|1
words cant really say how much i love this album but i will try anywayi was 9 years old when this album came out in 1979  i was only familiar with the single another brick in the wall part 2 at first and i played the 45 until it cracked literally  i remember the radio playing the entire album late one night beginning at midnight and i stayed up until 130 in the morning just to listen to the whole thing  then my older brother bought the 8 track tape  as some of you who are familiar with 8 track tapes might remember if you play the thing too many times the sound begins to warp  well i warped my brothers 8 track of the wall pretty quickly  at that point i had to resort to going to my friends house to listen to the album he had the vinyl copy  i didnt get my own copy of the wall on vinyl until my birthday in september of 1980  hey i was just a 9 year old kid i had no money to buy my own copyi dont really know what it was about the wall that made me love it so much  maybe it was all the cool artwork when you opened the record up something you wont get if you buy the mp3 version  maybe it was the theatrical nature of the album the trial was one of the weirdest things i had ever heard  my young ears were blown away  to this day i can still listen to the wall and never get tired of itthere are numerous classics on this album  another brick in the wall part 2 mother goodbye blue sky young lust hey you comfortably numb and run like hell are obvious ones  for me it was side 3 of the record that i loved the most  starting with hey you a beautiful haunting ballad sung by david gilmour that builds to an emotional climax with roger shouting dont tell me theres no hope at all  together we stand divided we fall  next up is is there anybody out there which has one of the most moving somber acoustic guitar solo i have ever heard  nobody home vera and bring the boys back home all flow together beautifully and you can feel real deep emotion in rogers vocals  comfortably numb ended side 3 on the vinyl version and this song is truly floyds masterpeice  the guitar solo at the end ranks as one of the best ever by any bandill be seeing roger performing this album later this year  i was too young in 1980 to catch pink floyds performances of the wall but i knew people who did go and i felt so jealous  now 30 years later i will finally get my chance|1
im only giving this a five star review because thats as high as the scale goesit deserves more it really doesid write a longer review but others have already covered the detail better than i could  whats harder to review is how this album made me feel in terms exhilirated delighted moved inspired amused saddened  and rockedlaughter tears sweatits all there an incredible achievementi paid 600 for three seats three rows back centre stage in birmingham i want them to play the whole thing as the first half of the show it might even be worth it|1
im only 16 and i know this album is amazing every song is great  not only is the music the best but meaning is great  it goes beyond music into poetry and symbolic meaning  you dont get that from too many albums  it sold 23million and its a double album  heres my pink floyd  order1dark side of the moon tied 1the wall 2 wish you were here 3  animals 4 division bellthe wall is one of the best albums of all time  if not the best and any real rock fan should own this album|1
i bought this cd from another website  i had no idea who matthew kelly was  this cd is very inspiring  it helps give you a direction in life to focus in on the important parts of yourself ie intellectual spiritual physical and emotional  i have listened to the cd so often that it is worn out  i highly recommend this inspirational talk|1
the wall is a remarkable album it was also the last floyd album to feature all four members roger waters david gilmour nick mason and richard wright because waters pretty much forced wright to leave during the making of this albumon any note the tone of this album is what makes it stand out from the rest at any moment a beautiful ballad can make a 180 degree turn into a dark and lonley world inside the wallthe best songs on this album are in the flesh mother and of course the radio friendly yet not totally commercial another brick in the wall pt2 and comfortably numbwaters pretty much takes helm on this album but coproducer bob ezrin tried his best to keep it from being a roger waters solo album which is how comfortably numb made it onto the albumi would suggest this album to anyone who is interested in floyd and is old enough to follow the concept storyline that this album tells|1
this is the most overrated album in all of rock and roll this is pink floyds worst album bay far nothing compared to wish you were here meddle or dark side now it does have some good materialhappiest days of our liveanother brick part ii in the flesh is there anybody out there and even a three really great songscomfortably numb hey you mother but this album is way too long i can barely stay awake when i put it on roger waters may actually do a good job of telling the story he sets out to tell the problem is by the end of this grueling over 100 minute recording nobody cares it is so hypocritical to hear millionaire rock stars singing about rebelling against education this album is was way too ambitious and way too dull to be even listenable|0
most lrc disks are inaccuratelymisleadingly labeled and this cd is no exceptionthe first three tracks are from thelonious monk and are attributed to a 1957 group featuring thad jones in actuality blue monk dates from a 1967 paris ortf concert featuring a nonet with clark terry soloing and is elsewhere available on cds from charly and fcd light blue and evidence are from a 1966 appearance at newport the quartet with charlie rouse larry gales and ben riley and are available on laserlight denon etcthe last two tracks are usually attributed to a 1960 paris concert by max roachs quintet with the turrentine brothers and julian priester and like the monk tracks are widely available elsewhere  i can attest that the fuel 2000 cd kardouba has better sound quality the track called to lady here is called kardouba on that cd  to lady is a different composition featured on roachs quiet as its kept album on mercurythese are all good performances so the cd is worth hearing  but if youre hoping for a concert recording of monk and roach performing together beware and if youre a collector you may very well have this material on other cds|0
i became aware of flyleaf a little over a year before they released their debut album i saw them open up for trust company and they really impressed me i picked up their little 4song ep and was hooked by itall the songs that appeared on that ep have been rerecorded for this album if youre unfamiliar with the group flyleaf is a femalefronted hard rock band they list their influences as nirvana foo fighters incubus silverchair ectbut i think their sound is a tad more aggressive than those bands the opening song im so sick could pass for full on metal lacey the singer screams like a banshee one minute and then shouts a very catchy chorus the next the next song fully alive is one of my favorites the chorus just makes you say wow as soon as you hear it other songs like cassie and red sam are just as excellent overall this is a hardrock album but some songs like there for you and the final song sound like a slow song that avril lavigne might sing note i hate to compare flyleaf to avril since she sucks but these songs kinda sound like her except theyre good any way if youre into evanescence staind audioslave or any femalefronted rock groups i srongly urge you to try this cd out|1
i bought this cd for two reasons 1 i collect all superhero music 2 i liked the twoface theme however goldenthal is all wrong for batman his music is always on the technical side and doesnt actually try to understand the characters but is just weird for weirdness sake elfman always writes his music with the emotions of the characters in mind something goldenthal doesnt even seem to care about his batman theme is too campywith the exception of the first track which is pretty good but not great the riddler music is just plain annoying his circus music is woefully inadequate and his action music is all noise and no substance even elfmans noisy cues contain substance the twoface music is the most interesting theme on this cd even though it is a little silly for a disfigured and brooding character if you want good superhero music check out batman batman returns or either spiderman scores coincidentally all elfman|0
i received 3 books form this author as a self professed book cover snob i set the books aside the cover just didnt grab me after reviewing several books that i didnt care for i was looking for a change of pace and picked up resonancethis book certainly delivered the change of pace i was looking for it starts out with several seemingly unrelated characters and their strange medical and scientific discoveries the story switches abruptly from one group of characters to the next making the reader a bit confused but keeping your interest as the plot eventually converges the characters meet and share their mysterious discoveriesabout three quarters through the book i was sure the mystery had been solved and the strange phenomenon that was predicted to be effecting the characters would occur and that would be the end of the story trying not to spoil the plot here it took me by complete surprise that it was not the end this book has a wonderful twist and it results in a whole new set of problems for the charactersthis is a fast and easy book to read it kept my attention and i read it in a few days i liked the characters and while the book is based on a scientific theory it wasnt so involved or technical that i didnt understand it give it a read|1
i do not agree with other peoples thoughts about this cd  its boring definatly not the best idea to spend you money on|0
off the top i want to comment on the production as that seems to be more polarizing than ever bottom line it is straightup 21st century if you dont like modern production values if you believe there was some golden age of audio 30 years ago and as such cant hear songs for the sonics this ones not for you that said the production is in uncompressed formats clear meaty and driving also delicate when needed to my ear there is plenty of dynamic range and the band sounds more live then they have in years the drums sound like real drums the guitars actually more focused and less layered than on the last couple albums and the bass is pitch perfect fat and rumbling but also clear with plenty of midpunch when alex drops out for a solo you dont even notice the rhythm guitar missing which is quite a feat yes this is mastered louder per current standards but it doesnt digitally clip like vapor trailsproduction technicalities aside what we have here is that rarest of albums one that can easily stand alongside the bands classic releases havent seen a band pull that off since iron maidens a matter of life and death back in 2006 rush even surpasses their own legacy in some ways as there is an element of maturity here that would have been impossible 30 years ago the songs are for the most part uniformly strong with even the slightly weaker ones halo effect and wish you well being buoyed up by the conceptual tapestry surrounding them at the same time peart has given us a batch of songs that for the most part can stand on their own absent knowledge of the conceptspeaking of that concept whether intentional or not clockwork angels is something of a sequel to 2112 thematically if nothing else different protagonist different backdrop different plot development but the same notion of the individual pitted against an overarching system that thinks it knows whats best he struggles learns finds loses and then finds hope again but whereas 2112 was the bands furious reply to the idea that they needed to compromise to survive clockwork angels is an examination of where you are when the dust has settled when youve been through the best and worst life has to offer 2112 asked this question as well but the answer was one of conjecture one of howling suicidal escape rather than capitulation clockwork on the other hand is a story of just how much a person can survive and ultimately in headlong flight sees its protagonist proclaim i wish that i could live it all again all not just the good parts which is hugely relevant both to the fictional storyline and what lyricistdrummer neil peart has lived through in his real life the album ends with wish them well a surprisingly turntheothercheek response to those who would wear you down via relentless negativity and the garden a gorgeous closing meditation on the need to tend to ones own sense of meaning and satisfaction happiness is where you find it becomes happiness is where you grow it a far cry reference intended from slitting your wrists just as the elder race shows up to save youbut before we get to closure we get the fury of beginnings and there is plenty of that anger albeit not as scathing as 2112s onslaught caravan kicks off the proceedings establishing both the main characters motivation and the band as a stilltowering paragon of musicianship and chemistry the main riff and chorus are great but its the instrumental bridge section that really lets us know rush is back in a way we havent seen in awhile much like show dont tell some 20 years ago the song gets its melodic hooks in you and then lets the band loose for a good two minutes in the middle tight punchy borderlinefunk riffs capped off with a daringly atonal guitar solo from alex lifesonnext is the albums heaviest track lyrically and musically bu2b brought up to believe an attack on the fictional plots watchmaker an attack on predetermination on the enemies of free willan attack even on god if you choose to read it as such bu2b imagines an overlord who loves us all to death and the band backs it up with verse slabs of downtuned guitar juxtaposed against an unexpected grace under pressureesque bridgefrom there we hit the title track the albums promised epic and while it doesnt quite live up to the hype that it would be a multiparter in the vein of natural science clockwork angels still stands as the bands longest most varied song since 1981s the camera eye characterized throughout by a rolling 68 or swing depending on how you look at it feel the song moves through a series of moods with great efficacy with another great lifeson solo and even a lyric lifted from an in n out burger shake cup this song also brings me to another point of contention regarding this album geddys vocal melodies they make this song ive seen a lot of reviews claim his voice is shot and that there are no real melodies on the album i couldnt disagree more while its true that his range isnt what it once was and hasnt been since 1980 really the melodies on this album are incredible very complex and varied much moreso than the early years but absolutely there i half wonder if the confusion stems from people wanting simpler melodies there is some legitimacy to this in that the simpler melodies of yesteryear were a significant part of what helped make rushs otherwise complex and sometimes downright bizarre music more accessible but for the purposes of this album i think the busier lines work perfectly revealing themselves almost exponentially on repeat listensmoving on we hit the anarchist and carnies the former executing a clever basslinethatbecomesvocalline trick and featuring another riff that hearkens back to the chorusedout 80s and the latter doing a pinchharmonic take on what could be a rhythmic reference to working man nowhere near as blatant as the bastille day tag in headlong flight but still arguably there lyrically both songs serve to back our protagonist into a corner as he is manipulated by one of the storys villains though the anarchist also sees a perhaps embittered version of 2112s hero lamenting a world where there was never time enough to sing that song its the guitar being smashed at syrinx all over but with a different character outcome i never wanted to belongi was so strong he proclaims the eternal mantra of the outsider who decides to hate the world before it can hate himhalo effect is the albums first soft spot and would be something of a throwaway if it didnt serve as a bridge to the rest of the story while not a bad song it doesnt have much variation and comes across more as an interlude than a standalone piece the song it leads into is another of the records epics seven cities of gold reportedly equally influenced by cormac mccarthy and the spanish myth of lost north american cities of gold the song opens with a straightahead riff that wouldnt have been out of place on fly by night this is a solid satisfying song though it plods a bit in comparison to the preceding heavies and also sends the story off on a something of a lyrical tangentthis brings us to the wreckers a story of murderers who causes deliberate shipwrecks for the purpose of plunder this song to me is more significant for the light it sheds on pearts current philosophy than it is for its place in the narrative for the most part a ballad it features a beautiful chorus where the the protagonist laments all i know is sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be truebecause sometimes the target is you and ultimately that sometimes memory can be too much to carry  striking down like a bolt from the blue one of the albums most powerful moments without a doubtand then we get to where i started headlong flight a rollicking 7minute barnburner with the alreadymentioned bastille day reference frontandcenter this song is as close to pre2112 rush as we are ever going to hear ever featuring a spiraling toolish opening bass riff absolutely ferocious drumming including a fullblown solo and a wahdrenched lifeson shredfest that really could have been airlifted in from 1974 this is the band giving it all theyve still got on the straightup attack front and of course tied together with geddys belting of that great line i wish that i could live it all againin closing i think rush have made an album for the ages one that id be as comfortable giving a new listener to the band as a starting point as i would say permanent waves perhaps the most successful group to ever have its fanbase defined predominantly by those who want to see their favorite band evolve with each release rush have made good on that promise consistently for almost four decades and clockwork angels not only is no exception but should this be the last goaround will serve brilliantly as a summation it is also for all its conceptual grandiosity possibly the most lyrically personal album in the bands catalog neil peart doesnt give many interviews and when he does his personal tragedies are explicitly not touched upon and while i respect that particularly in that he hasnt given in to the current memoir culture of misery voyeurism its been hard not to wonder how such events affect a mind so given to exploration of ultimate meaning as pearts this isnt to say the world isnt full of people who have suffered as much or more but rarely are they in a position of similar intelligence eloquence and public exposure i contend the mans twocents on these matters bears more resemblance to gold doubloons than actual pennieslastly geddy and alex neither has lost an ounce in instrumental ability if anything geddy is more fluid than ever and lifesons solos are still exercises in a glorious sort of transcendental freneticism geddys voice has lost some range and he has trouble keeping up vocally live night after night for three hours at a pop but he sounds great on this album if this is to be rushs final album let it be said they went out bringing the same intelligent fire that put them on the map in the first place way back when their first ar man said i dont hear a single and three guys from willowdale responded we have assumed controllastly lastly a note on format this album sounds far and away the best on vinyl if thats too cumbersome definitely track it down lossless flac wav alac or on good ol cd it does get a little brittle in compressed formats like mp3 still plenty listenable at 320k especially in a car or in the background but for the full experience youre gonna want all them wavelengths intact matter of fact i half wonder if a good chunk of the people who dont like the albums sound have only heard it compressed thats becoming more and more common im sad to say|1

this album actually received 1 and 35 stars but thats not an option on the rating scale  it was too undescribably whacky to give a full two stars yet made me giggle so hard that i almost hypervenelated thus  deserving well more than one  it sounds like a mix between video game  music with hilarious simple bass beats and vocals like a cartoon theme  song  i laughed and laughed and laughed anyone who is seriously  considering a lpds collection should do one of the following  a buy  chemical playschool volumes 8  9 if they can be found  b buy  crushed velvet apocalypse if a is not at all possible or c buy this  album and listen to it either when on laughing gas or when annoying hippies  are over and you want them to leave in a hurry  on second thought if you  want an album that really kicks some serious fuzz and yet is so annoying  that itll make your head spin get lysol by melvins  otherwise if youre  looking for something magickal thats filled with both beauty and a touch  of weirdness get something the lpds made in the late nineties  definitely  more refined  regardless of this brighter now will forever remain a part  of my otherwise eloquent collection simply because i am very easily  amused|0
i became acquainted with raffi through my sisters children many years ago and now her grandchildren love him just as much as their parents did i bought the collection to share with a little 212 year old greatnephew and now he too loves to sing along|1
i didnt like the quality of c d sound like made from a c d that was worn or used to record to many times i know this is not the quality of first cd i hear|0
saw it live first studio recording is not disappointing the guys still know how to do it after all these years|1
i need to warn you all those who didnt notice or dont know the difference according to the product page this is a cdr not a cd cds are pressed just like vinyl albums cdrs are burned with lasers cdrs dont last as long and dont play in all cd players the risk isnt huge but its there and you need to know about it|0
why did i say this was ridiculous because these spoiled brats and all those other teenpop artists have enhanced cds and much better talented stunts like phil collins stevie wonder and especially andrea bocelli  cant get one ill leave christina aguilera out of this at least she can  singdear backstreeters you ought to get it going on with andrea  bocelli which i very much doubt you will|0
everyone is comparing this one to the first why bother if you like these guys chances are you will like everything they put out i know i do after all you have four longtime hard driving rockers that have been doing it for years sammy sounds as good as ever and joe is one of the all time greats the highlight of the disc for me is something gone wrong what a great song joe pours his soul out with his guitar playing in this song mikes backup vocals are tremendous here a good mix of rockers and ballads on this disc when you mix this album with the other it will make one great concert it should be a great tour i am just glad these guys are still making new music after all these years great cd|1
i am a huge bush fan but i have to say that this album is not up to the greatness that one would expect form this band  i loved mouth which is the best cut off the album and the only one worth listening to  this one was mixed by gavin himself which proves that only bush can get themselves right|0
i would avoid this set despite its price and the fact that it includes all the songs without words  alpenheim is simply not a professional quality pianist and was likely only recorded because of her husband the great conductor antal dorati  alpenheim doesnt have the technical proficiency or range of textures one would expect from a firstrate pianist but what is most annoying is her inability to shape the musics melodic line into an expressive whole  look elsewhere|0
while i truly enjoyed the wall it is obvious that this was not a colaberative album  this is mostly a work of roger waters which i believe slightly taints the albumthis is a very popular album and a good album for new floyd fans but after listening to this album one should hear floyd at their best in wish you were here and dark side of the moon|1
the only good pieces in this score are the beginning and end titles and chekov in the hospital  everything else is unoriginal filler  three songs do not justify the retail price of this album  the only good thing about this score is if you buy it you wont have to buy any other soundtracks that this rosenman fellow has written since they all sound pretty much the same  the other good point is that the score at least works okay in the movie but is unlistenable in of itself unless this is your first time listening to rosenmans works in general  courages goldsmiths horners eidelmanns and even mccarthys symphonic renditions of the star trek films all kick this scores sorry  towards the event horizon into what they used to call a black holesttmp  if you really must buy this score try your best to obtain one in the used bin  beware of ebay though  it almost seems like anyone will pay much more than what a particular item is really worth in many occasions there   reinhart|0
some of the best music that they floyd have ever made the story it tells the depth and flow of the sound is very moving ive probably listened to it at least a thousand times and i get a different feel from it every timei had wrote a different review on it using some left handed sarcastic humor from the view of a pot smoking acid popping freak which in my opinion is the way that the music was made to be experienced some people didnt get it so i decided to re write my review on itbut either way strait or freak you will either love it or hate it it depends on your taste in musicin my younger wilder days this was one of the top 5 albums to listen to while partying in my older days im 50 now and had to give up a lot of the fun things that i used to do i still like to put this on the stereo kick back listen to it with the headphones on and remember better times|1
im a lifetime rush fan and have stuck with them since the beginning  at first listen of this album i did the face in palm as i have done with other rush albums however after listening to this more and more i now realize the songs are very good however the mixing is terrible and its extremely distorted  sad since its great music too irritating to listen to|0
bought this record for my son who loves pink floyd  there isnt anything negative you can say about this band or record  except that my son likes to play it more than i like to hear it |1
i have a problem giving a pink floyd product just one star i am a huge fan and theres nothing i love more in this world than pink floyd but i was dissappointed with this box set this is not a review of the music the music is out of this world fantastic this is a review of the box set the extra stuff is completely useless the marbles are clear dont understand whats the point i can buy clear marbles at a toy store or dollar store the coasters concert ticket back stage pass look cheap cheap papercardboard even the print is bad quality the scarf feels cheap alsoi wish i had bought the experience version i just want the music and video i do like to have pink floyd memorabilia but not this cheaply made stuffthe music of course is outstanding cool to listen to the early versions of the animals songs and i absolutely love the wish you were here version with stephane grapelli i happen to like him also so i was so surprised to hear this beautiful versionits always wonderful to hear new live versions of any pink floyd song they are just fantasticagain the 1 star is for the extras in this box set|0
good god i laughed so hard at this i could not even get over it excellent comedy cd brian regan has a way of delivering his jokes that will just have you doubled over hes also a great guy he sent me an autographed picture personalized for my friends that are big fans just for my asking great guy hilarious cd buy one for yourself and one for a gift|1
if youre turned off by most comedians because their humor is offcolor youll love brian regan  he is so funny but hes not gross  my husband brought this home and i didnt want to bother listening to it but im hooked  i was laughing so hard   i wish amazon would carry his dvd because its even funnier when you can see the facial expressionsgreat dvd and this makes a great gift|1
this album is top notch if you get the chance myles and slash put on a great live show as well songs sound even better in person|1
this recording by dexter gordon actually contains four jazz standards and two of his originals fried bananas and junior the advertised cd is full of blues tunes and must be done by a blues artist not dexter gordon|0
i was looking for highlights of fred allen not full shows with commercials and not jack benny the stereotype of cheap jewishness  i wanted to play allen on my college radio show and dont have the know how to cut them up|0
soft barely discernible notes twinkling in an almost sinister childish melody suddenly loud anthemic guitar chords are played this is how pink floyds the wall opens a rock opera that is along with dark side of the moon widely considered to be pink floyds best album is it really pink floyds best album as many people here make it out to be no its not in fact its not even one of their better albumswhy is it that this doesnt rank among their better albums i used to think it was because their usual spacey psychedelic sound isnt as prominent on this album thats not it though i mean genesis went for a different approach on the lamb lies down on broadway and yet it is probably genesiss best overall album the problem is that pink floyd had decided that the lyrics were more important than the music really it was rogers and davids fault by this time both of their egos had swollen and they both had decided to kick rick wright out of the band it is the fact that rick wright was absent for over half of the album is what really brings it down as his work with the keyboards is absolutely amazing so is the music bad well because this is pink floyd it is definitely not bad its got a lot of weak spots but there are also some absolutely mind blowing moments comfortably numb is a beautiful and mysterious song hey you is dark and quite eerie the trial is really weird but is also really good is there anybody out there is haunting with its finger picked acoustic melody and light orchestration goodbye blue sky is perhaps even more chilling also featuring an acoustic finger picked melody and some stunning synthwork a lot of the album features an orchestra and i have to say as with atom heart mother the orchestra goes really well with the musicso whats so great about these lyrics that roger waters felt were more important than the actual music the lyrics tell a story and the story is a mixture of the story of roger waters and the tragic descent into madness of their original guitaristsingersongwriterfrontman syd barrett of course there are a lot of fictional elements added inneither of the aforementioned men ever got up on stage and called everyone in the audience out racially neither man was or is a nazi etc the lyrics and concept on this album are better any other thought up by waters and you always discover something new in the story with each listenso is the wall worth buying of course it is all pink floyd albumsdiscounting amlor are worth buying at some point who knows you may even end up considering it to be pink floyds best album|1
the music on this album is quite good  my favorite song is the wreckers with the theme that things may not be as good as they seem  this is a  concept album different than any i have seen in that the story is told in part along with the words to the songs in the booklet  that helps keep the listener from getting lost|1
another great rush album   ready to see them in concert come september 22nd in st louis   the dudes abide |1
please offer this cd  kim robertson is one of the best there is and i would like to purchase nice christmas music without the bombastic offerings we are so overloaded with by other artists|1
this smooth jazz release from barbara jones and henrik bridger has a little bit of everything popinspired melodies funky grooves and jazzy performances all around  i love how these two play piano and bass  a nice touch to this album was the variety of lead players  in addition to the piano lead there are songs on the album that prominently feature saxophone and guitar  eric marienthal plays some sweet sax and his solos are as always wellcrafted  stefan rosqvists guitar solo on the title track this side up is worthy of our greatest guitar heroes  i had a lot fun listening to all the tracks  the goods|1
fantastic collection of songs  our twoyear old demands song multiple times a day and loves singing and dancing along  perfect|1
i bought this cd cause i am starting sound design for multimedia production the first thing you see when you look at the box is  these sound effects are intended for home and private use onlydo they think people need sound effects for their holidays movies |0
im absolutely confounded by reviewers citing the amazing musicianship on this pretentious cd  these guys slam their way through an hour of agonizing overly loud and over produced noise  each time they approach a subtle moment the guitar players make sure to crush it to death with overbearing metal riffs that were already long worn out in the 70s  if i could give this disc no stars i would  it is the most unfeeling and emotionless christmas music i have ever heard  save your money|0
i love all the kelly howell cds and this one is no exception i just wish sometimes that her music wasnt so loud in the background it is distracting to me as i strain to hear what shes saying other than that i probably own most all of her stuff and enjoy it her voice is lovely and soothing you wont be disappointed|1
im happy to see that this cd is now available here as of last month it hadnt been if youre unfamiliar with brian regan remedy the situation by buying this cd i agree with other reviewers that he is the funniest standup comedian working today i agree also that his humor bears repeated listening his is some of the funniest material extant his renderings of his youthful experiences are especially noteworthy he depicts the young brian as a sort of addled hopelessly inept comic boob who somehow survives his brothers lessthanhelpful suggestions and his teachers castigations but then again the adult brian is not much savvier as his trip to a health spa indicatesits also been mentioned that regans act is family friendly try to find a download of his appearances on the infamous opie and anthony radio show for his funny take on this notion those appearances also highlight the fact that regan is spontaneously funny as well as being a great standup he delivers some great offthecuff responses to callers requestsodd to say i find listening to regan more enjoyable than watching him on his comedy central special the images that my imagination conjures up at his instigation are funnier than when i see them acted out onscreen i have no doubt that he would be marvelous to see live but i am content for now to listen and laughthis cd is a surefire bad mood destroyer if you are searching for entertainment and lighthearted goodnatured comedy look no further you cannot have a sense of humor and remain impassive to this creative comics material|1
it seems all thos forgotten albuns of nwobhm are now regarded as predecessors of speed metal originators of trash things like thatthis album is perfunctory in a lot of ways bad production anemic vocals so and so guitar work bad melodies|0
i loved hearing him when he was with guns n roses and this cd is one of his best  ive listened to it a lot and ove it as much as the first time|1
i just found out my rule a thumb  if i listen to a cd and immediately afterwards i listen again that means that its a very good cd if after that i listen again then its a gem well i listened to this cd three 3 times in a row  this is pure bluegrass banjo playing in the best of traditions i recommmend this album to any bluegrasslover and banjoplayer|1
of all the music on this cd the only thing that stands out is hymn to the seathe rest is the usual cinematic fluff that any composer can throw together by the albumloadand that celine dion songi thought she was getting her throat slitplease dont waste your money on this nothing of an albumthere are countless great recordings out thereand this isnt one of them|0
took forever to find this cd and i was hoping for a decent album because i found one song i heard from it meriasie street profoundly interesting sadly the rest of the cd was mostly uninspired fillerwell at least i learned something i wouldnt take a risk like this again|0
this is the story of a rock star who is burned out on fame and begins hating his audiences  to show his disdain he begins giving them absolute trash and they dont know the differenceirony thy name is waters|0
this is a wonderful album it mixes traditional songs with new ones it is fun and lively enjoyed by the entire family the songs focus on the sense of togetherness and joy of the holiday|1
this cd is totally boring even when penny lane comes along to pick things up cause by the time penny lane comes along im already so down and out bc of how boring the previous tracks are penny lane just isnt much i like music from all decades and the 60s is no exception  but what the heck is so great about this cd  nothing|0
the newest release from that trio up north is probably their best since snakes and arrows and yes i know snakes and arrows was their last studio release my point is everything they make is great rush has such a unique sound that also appeals to a broad range of fans i have been a fan since their release of 2112 and i have every album they have made except for a couple of their live releases if you dont have this one yet rush out and get it|1
dear mr simon please take some lessons on ravels piano music before tackling it this is not chopin take your foot of the pedal once in a while this is outrageously bad|0
after falling in love with chickenfoots first album i looked forward to their second release  was not disappointed  these guys rock it up|1

i waited an insanely long time for my order to come in  it came in after the the estimated delivery date and when it did finally come in the case was cracked  i wrote a couple of times to inquire about the whereabouts of my purchase and no one ever got back to me  this in my opinion is horrible service and i would never order from this individual ever again|0
the wall is a towering achievement that causes nearly all other rock albums to pale in comparison the third bestselling album of all time after the eagles greatest hits and thriller the wall tells the tale of an angry young man who was verbally abused as a child and consequently builds up the wall to protect himself each attack on his young psyche results in another brick in the wallas the angry young man grows up the wall interferes with his relationships and some pretty weird stuff happens at one point the wall is so complete that the man becomes comfortably numb  a chilling thought that still sends shivers up my spine i always envision that serial killers become comfortably numb before they are able to kill people with dispassion again and again ultimately the wall is a story about a child who just wanted to be loved and isnt and on this level anyone can relate to itaside from perhaps tommy how many other twovolume sets in rock tell a complete vision of a single story none that im familiar withaside from the depth and resonance of the material the music is also mesmerizing powerful and deeply disturbing spare instrumentals the use of sonic sounds like breaking glass and busy signals as music are all far more original than any of the rockschlock that has been released in the past 20 years i could list all of the great songs on the record but that would be pointless to me the amazing thing is that there are no bad songs on this recordso go out and buy this and maybe ten years from now the wall can overtake thriller and the eagles as having the no 1 bestselling album of all time it would certainly be worthy of that title|1
look im not going to tell you how great this movie is but this is truly the last of the really cool hellraiser films for all star trekds9 fans it stars a young terry farrell who you might also recently recognize from reruns of ted dansons cbs show beckeranyway the true reason why im writing this is to ask each of you to start some fire to get this properly released on dvd ysee this version been floating around since the dawn of dvd but its definitely the weakest dvd presentation of all the films while being one of the best of the seriesthis disc is only in fullframe blacksparkly weak picture only 20 audio lame menu and with no extras whatsoever however it does feature the uncut version of the film and if youve only seen it in the theatre or on cable this versions alot more gorier but seriously anchor bay should properly release this here in america this is a canadian release in the same ntsc format as usa they did a great job on parts one  two why not this one probably due to its all heavy metal soundtrack and getting those past musical rights for rerelease on dvd can sometimes be extremely hard and anchor bay or other release companies probably said its the third one why bother but this film deserves it its one of my top favorites of the series and definitely earns the right so start one of those online campaigns ive seen for other lost movie classics and give hell on earth its respectps ive rated this disc overall only 2 stars but the movie deserves 5 all on its ownpss and to all the other reviews who didnt like this one all i can say is two things one you mean you didnt like all the new cenobites at allreally and two have you seen parts 4  5 yet if not see those two  then tell me this is lame|0
i also own the cd the romantic pianist by emi which has nocturnes 13 20 and 21 the romantic pianist sounds so much better than this one by arrau|0
outside of the former ussr borodins symphonies have generally been neglected in the past this is a shame because they have good melodies a good sense of structure and plenty of life and colour they arent the greatest of symphonic works by any stretch neither is borodin a great composer but his work doesnt deserve such neglect fortunately this is changing and the general trend is one of rediscovery and there are now plenty of recordings available unfortunately many of them are subpar this is one of the worstperformance 25the csr certainly doesnt appear to be a good orchestra at least that is the case here they have made some other much superior recordings for naxos and marco polo here their string tone wants for much sweetness and expression the winds are quite coarse and sour the brass is underwhelming those expecting a russianoriented soundworld will be disappointed the csr never tries to emulate the russian orchestral tradition overall the orchestral response is rather uninspiredunusually gunzenhauser seems content with second best he doesnt seem to demand much from the orchestra he is a completely different animal her from the gunzenhauser who has led some creditable dvorak symphonies he rarely finds inspiration in these scores gunzenhauser is quite content to meander through this music and the results are somewhat detachedsound 35this gets quite close to some of the worst naxos sound recorded it is generally quite grey and nondescript the colour of the orchestra does not feel like it is being conveyed honestly there is some body and weight and at times reasonably good amounts of bloom this is by no means a sonic thrillinterpretation 25gunzenhauser walks through these scores with little sense of mystery excitement or anticipation he becomes quite workmanlike occasionally even mechanical there is little or no insight provided here added to this is the fact that the section leaders are no where near virtuosos and dont play their solos to the full potential this is a bit of a musical flopfortunately there are good alternatives most of them arent particularly expensive for the full russian flavour svetlanov with the ussr symphony orchestra offers genuine musicality great expression and a very russian flavour along with svetlanov jarvi offers some of the best borodin his performances are recorded on dg but arent presently in the catalogue ashkenazy on decca is another superior alternative as is tjecknavorian on rca even if the national philharmonic doesnt play as well as it could|0
this guy is hilarioussitting at work with tears running down my face  i couldnt even pick a favorite because it is all so good|1
this review from a diehard rush fan since 75 clockwork angels is possibly the best album theyve ever made musically the band moves forward by looking back a concept album with a very strong set of songs and incredible instrumentation especially alex lifesons guitar work if this album doesnt sell a zillion copies earn them a grammy for the garden and put them in the rnrhof there is something very wrong with the system groups around almost 40 years rarely come up with new songs this great|1
i ordered magical mystery tour at a secondhand price  after a minimal amount of playing it became useless unplayable  i will never do this again|0
unfotunately this cd is very disappointing it comes across as an effort to put out product and make some money by some very talented musicians who have nothing to say it is well recorded and produced but the tunes are boring and the lyrics are meanignless and shallow it really comes across as a recording by some rich lazy fat musicians who have lots of guitars free time and money|0
my 1 star review is just a way to make things rightof course zeze e luciano deserves zero stars but thats not possibleanyway when i see this 5 star zeze album i almost criedtheres only 2 reviews for this total lack of musical good taste on decadesso please let me be the one to save music and give this 1 star to this mediocricity that is zeze e luciano|0
there are a lot of rock albums that claim to be the best of all time  the wall in my humble opinion holds that spot  it combines poetic lyrics atmospheric music and audio effects that continually blow my mindthis concept was turned into a stage production and a video  i feel this will change the way you listen to music  it will challenge your thoughts of what a great rock album should be  if you dont own this peice or art you truly have a black hole in your music collectionroger waters and david gilmour have created one of the most ambitious projects in modern rock  only sgt peppers and tommy come close to the same level of expertise as the wall|1
slash has somehow managed to keep it going for over 25 years now  most people burn out by this point  with his latest band he yet again steps up to the plate and cranks it out of the park  apocalyptic love youre a lie standing in the sun and we will roam are heavy standouts tracks from this album  the other songs are great as well those are just my personal favorites  with the great myles kennedy on vocals slash has once again managed to snag one of the best voices in the business  a credit to myles his lyrics explode from the first track and he doesnt stop until the last track not a lot of ballads on this one song comes close this is all about explosive energy incredible guitar attack and unforgettable solos  keep it up oh tophatted guitar god|1
this set is terribly let down by the two leads ludwig sounds like an octavian stretching to become a marschalinits a great stunt but the voice isnt right gwyneth jones is a curse with hher sqawlly unfocused singing so without the two leads it doesnt matter to me how buoyant bernstein is on the podiumand in truth he is often too hectic this must have been a great event live one of lennys viennese triumphs but the recording falls apart|0
the greatest moment of all was k380 and the excellent ritenuti he did right before he starts that is exactly what the style of scarlatti is good job and great musical understanding oh do i love those people actually it was bad very bad|0
while i dont agree with all the philosophies of rush they are one of my favorite bands for their talents this cd tells a story following a boy trying to find his place in a world where the watchmaker controls everything some songs are harder than past rush cds some are softer and very touching all in all a very good cd the digital booklet do not download for me though|1
my brother in law is an avid rush fan and has all their stuff  was so happy to get this for christmas|1
i saw the review posted here about the albums being edited  a comment gave a new link for an unedited version but that one was edited as well  guess im out some moneydont download buy the real cd  amazon is lying to you|0
i do not normally commence a review by commenting negatively on another review of the same recording but in this case i have to immediately state that the review with 4 stars is so misguided and illinformed that i have to issue an immediate warning to any prospective purchaser please read onotmar suitner in fact an austrian conductor not only had a long and distinguished career in the eastern block serving terms as music director of both the dresden and berlin staatskappelles but conducted regularly in bayreuth munichand in the usa famously at the met and especially in san francisco where he conducted a ring cycle in the 60s featuring nilsson berit lindholm as sieglinde thomas stewart as wotan james king as siegmund and jess thomas as siegfried among othersgolden days illicit recordings exist in execrable sound but the artistry is evident in the uk his extensive discography has been largely available only through specialist importers though dg issued his dresden mahler one in the late 60s to great acclaim and he has the distinction of having the first beethoven 9 to be released on a single cd by denon what a pity he was not entrusted with the 1980s  dresden ring rather than janowskithis 1963 recording from the lukaskirche in dresden is stunning in both conducting and playing the dresden staatskapelle gave the premier of this work and in this recording i can say that even the vpo for solti karajan and dohnanyi comes off second best such is the brilliance of execution and richness of tonesuitner conducts a swift  thrusting and very high octane performance sweeping the listener along relentlessly the drama crackles in his handsthe recording is amazingit is one of the finest most detailed and full recordings ever remastered brilliantly by berlin classics and devoid of background hiss it is better recorded than just about every rival i kid you noti really know this work and i have heard detail as never before from this astonishing technical achievementnow we come to the singing gutstein is a fine and noble jochanaan melchert familiar to us from kempes rheingold highligts recording is an over the top bad tempered herod who shouts a lot but is very well sung the herodias of ericsdotter is fine if not great and the assorted jews and nazarenes including several renowned artists such as theo adam are excellentthe work opens with a drawling ill focused heinz hoppe who gives us as narraboth that sounds more like mime or herod with a page who is truly awfulthis leaves christel goltz as salome she was a renowned essayer of this role which she had sung for many years by the time of this recording she was 51 which in itself does not mean that the role should have been beyond her it is not often i write this but she is truly appalling not only is the voice tired and aged sounding she is incapable of sustaining all but the briefest of notes without wobblingwobbling did i writeshe falls off has no breath control and cannot sustain even the word jochanaan in a single breath sings consistently off key and caterwauls and shrieks her way through the whole workwhen friend and fellow reviewer ralph moore and i disagree about sung performances it is invariably because i am more tolerant of minor wobbles and vocal infelicities than he whose standards are the most exactingno amount of tolerance could sustain exposure to the excruciating destruction of this great role perpetrated on this recordingi will admit that after herods entry as salomes phrases become more staccato ms goltz becomes more tolerable and occasionally hits a note on pitch so that we can survive to the endor maybe im just battered into submissionit is like some exquisitely sadistic torturethe thrilling playing superb conducting and glorious sound on one handand the cringe inducing singing on the otherchristel goltz can be heard to better advantage on the 1948 keilberth mono recording and if it is your prime concern to have her performing this role then that is the recording to buyfor lovers of this work it is worth trying to hear this recording for the superb artistry of conductor and orchestra astonishing recording much better for example than chandos 1999 danish recording of the decca dohnanyi both digital of course and fine performances of herod and jochanaanbut be prepared to be horribly disappointed otherwise im trying to develop a zen technique whereby i can listen to this recording while blotting out goltz and hearing behrens caballe or inge neilsen extraordinarily fine in my head after this ill never complain about marton or gwyneth jones again dont pay a lot for this settrust me on this 2 and a half stars for conducting playing and recording stewart crowe|0
the wall is my favourite album from the great pink floyd after the dark side of the moon and wish you were herethis double album contains comfortably numb which certainly has to figure in the top ten rock songs of all timeso take my advice and get all their albums till meddlevery highly recommended|1

when we ordered judgemenr at nuremberg we requested the movie and never even thought there might be a misunderstanding and not receive what we originaly requested instead we were extremely dicouraged to receive sound track instead of what was ordered the movie|0
thats echo bridge for you for once they have the whole disk available to a movie and they bork it up with a bad transfer hellraiser iii is in 43 fullscreen with a very washedout and headache inducing blurriness its completely unwatchable and i simply threw it in the trash which is where it belongs along with echo bridgethe movie itself is fine and starts where hellraiser 2 left off its too bad miramax gave the rights to echo instead of lionsgate mill creek or image entertainment which has 1  2 stay away from this disk folks|0
alright i admit it i just dont understand the attraction the general public has to paul oakenfold everything ive heard by him shows no particular skill in mixing and perhaps the biggest reason for his publicity is that he plays the trippy type of tunes that appeal to teenagers many of whom go to raves more for the social or chemical scene than for the musichis live in oslo release in the global underground series is a perfect example of this his set works more like a mix tape tracks thrown in randomly than like a true djs set which should consist of a warmup and than a series of shifts designed to give the listener a voyagetype feel and the mixing is awful as one reviewer  pointed out the songs are only mixed through a couple of bars thats a problem on dave seamans cape town global underground retrospective a few notes of the baguio track are mixed into planispheres so many ways for several minutes so that the coming track is like a coming stormfront oakenfolds live in oslo however has more the feel of a dj saying ok this track bores me let me just throw the crossfader all the way over nowif you want to hear a real dj doing a real set which involves organizing a tracklisting carefully and mixing impeccably try sashas ibiza retrospective or john digweeds hong kong leave oakenfold to the kids|0
every band has tapes of informal sessions  those first meetings when you havent played together for several months maybe even years and you want to see whether youve still got it as a coherent unit  or maybe you just want to see what the band makes of some new material youve recently writtenthe question is what to do with those tapes  at one extreme you have the steely dan attitude of releasing no outtakes whatsoever leaving their fans with a relatively small catalogue of unblemished perfection  towards the other end of the scale you have been able to buy box sets of for example the pet sounds sessions so you can listen to the minutiae of how the final product was assembledon balance i would rather this van der graaf cd had not been released  the band or at least their label clearly decided the material was not good enough for release when it was originally recorded  in the uk this cd is sold in the budget category  a number of casual browsers unfamiliar with vdgg are going to pick this up listen to it and write off the bandthe first three tracks though reasonably well recorded feature a hammillless and consequently rather directionless van der graaf trying out instrumentals in various early 80s styles eg soft reggae  hammill appears for the subsequent tracks but the recording quality deteriorates dramaticallyfor me there is just one interesting track roncevaux but the sound quality is so abysmal  microphoneattheoppositeendofthevillagehall quality  that it betrays the memory of van der graafon paper this album sounds wonderful  most of the tracks were recorded after pawn hearts and before godbluff  but i really think the band should have stuck by its original decision not to release them  sorry folks|0
why this mediocrity is the only soundtrack choice available is beyond me the original soundtrack to the original 1951 classic the thingis far more thrilling and imaginative it evokes all that is  alien in a single soundtrack and is the 1st to set the standard this  morricone limp bisquit of an effort is an insult of  inconsequential banalityif you know this scifi classic by heart then a  listen to the complete thing suite will evoke the entire story  before your minds eye like no other press this masterpiece into a cd of  scifi soundtrack classics and forget the mediocre morricone shrinkwrapped  afterthought of an excuse for a soundtrack|0
i was only 11 years old and growing up in a small town in england when this album came out but even then the video to another brick in the wall made a deep impression on me it was number 1 in the charts at the time i remember it being actually quite frightening and at the time the weirdest thing id ever seen on british tvive since listened to the album an awful lot and seen the movie and i have a much better understanding now of why its so weird roger waters is clearly an angry man and doesnt hold his bitterness back and why should he i always think the best songs are those that are the most honest and these ones are clearly written from the heart  admittedly a fairly dark one the childhood anguish and resentment of having lost your father in what you perceive to be a pointless war is a dominant theme and when this is set against a backdrop of unhappy and lonely schooldays at the hands of vicious dictatorial teachers dont expect to be dancing to this album in your local disco having said that there is some deliciously black humour in some of the songs especially waiting for the worms and the trialthis is generally considered to be one of the first if not the first concept albums and pink floyd deserve credit for having the bravery to do it they went out on quite a limb and it could very easily have been ridiculed as a bloated extravagance the musical score is incredibly ambitious but i think it represents a real strength of the album the songs are incredibly varied i genuinely cant think of any other album that contains slow pianobased songs eg nobody home soaring guitar solos eg comfortably numb thumping stadium rock eg another brick part 3 run like hell theatricals the trial waiting for the worms and practically whispered poems one of my turns introthe lyrics themselves are also remarkably wideranging representing anger eg mother another brick seedy seduction young lust plaintive sadness nobody home vera creepy anybody out there childhood reflection comfortably numb and just plain weirdness in the flesh some of the songs are just so wellwritten they are profoundly moving  try listening to nobody home while sitting in a comfortable chair with the lights off and you will see what i meanthe lyrics and music are so finely matched that i really consider this album to be a work of genius i just love the richness and depth of the vocals in songs like mother and nobody home and the album is liberally scattered with neat vocal tricks and effects that fit in so well eg the voice through the loudhailer in waiting for the worms the sniggering laughs that appear in several songs the backing vocalsswitching between singers is also very professionalbe warned that you may not like this album the first time you listen to it but it definitely grows on you even to the point that you appreciate it in its entirety rather than just dipping into a song here and therein sum i heartily recommend this outstanding album to anyone who has an appreciation of real music ie more than 3 chords the use of some great words limited use of the words love and baby and no delimitation of songs into verse chorus verse chorus ad nauseumi am desperately sorry for roger waters that he had such an awful childhood but without wanting to sound superficial or insensitive i sincerely hope that writing this superb album helped him in some way thank you roger and pink floyd|1
bien jibaro is definitely a must have  a great sample of a lot of different styles of the typical puertorrican music like seis aguinaldo danza etc  edwin colon is the best cuatro player in the world and i highly recommend all of his cds|1
very nice music exquisit performance the cd was sold in mint condition tho sound of the record is perfect as well i like this music very much|1
okay you guys should already know the drill by now but ill fill in the other 5 or 6 of you that might not yet fathers day is here and im reviewing 3 of my dads favorite stupid musty old records for his preasant i did this for his birthday previously with sgt pepper blonde or blonde and a stupid beach boys record this time around im going over the stooges fun house this record and velvet underground with nico im really not into all of this old crap as you guys could see with the birthday trilogy but whatever he said that these 3 would be more up my alley but so far im just confused anyways here we go againokay great another beatles record oh no i mean two beatles records in one didnt you get the hint last time dad i will give you the benefit of the doubt only because on the pepper record you could tell just by looking at them that it was a drugparty record they were in a huge colorful dreamworld with silly little colorful costumes the music pretty much sounded like how the cover looked this one on the otherhand is just a white cover that says the beatles and has a number on ita bunch of zeroes and then 1022 is that the name of the record who cares alright its 2 records long and once again there will not be any kind of stereo sound to it because this old relic is inyou guessed it mono you do know what stereo is right dad anyways to shorten this review im going to listen to a side and then write about it afterwards maybe i will do the last side as it happens so my review can end right when the stupid record does and while i do this im going to color in the white cover with a sharpie to fool my dad lol okay markercaps off put the swingy thing on the record andbeginokay just listened to the first side heres what i gathered from it there was a cool airplane noise at the beginning some fastrock some slowrock a weird islandbopper with really loud piano too then there was short burst of what sounded like screeching muppets then a cowboydrugsong a motorcycle rocker and a creepy gunrock bebopper now i have to turn it over and i just got really discouraged because of how much im going to have to be doing thisalright side two where to begin in no specific order there were songs a lot of animalrock songs about pigs and birds and raccoons played like drugs were involved a sleepy song about drugs and a bizzare honkytonky fiddle jam then songs about girls as a sidenote i have almost completely colored the whole outershell of the record black now with my marker since im only half done with the music i will begin coloring the inside out of sheer boredomalright side three was pretty bizzare it had a happybirthday motorcycle rocker a depressing bluesthing a few slow songs thrown in and a completely out of control song about a pet monkey where it sounded like the guy was beating the crap out of a cowbell like his life depended on it it was actually pretty neat makes me want to hit something with a stick like that and there was this drugfreakout that was out of control with screaming and outoftune guitars they cant keep the music under control they irresponsibly bash away and someone yells about hurting his fingers thats what happens when you recklessly play music like that buddy anyways every single inch of cardboard is now colored black but with a bit of a purple sheen to it because thats just how magicmarkers are this record is wasting sooooooo much of my time but the end is nearside 4 in progress nowa revolutionrockerkind of boringokay a really embarrassing oldtimey thingwhy me a funky food songits kind of got some chunky horns on itanother boooooring slow rocker called crybabyand now a guy is saying number nine over and over and over andwha whatmake it stop oh my godthere is the most bizarre noises ive ever heard being made herethis is scaring the crap out of my dog morris and me toowhat the heck is going on how on earth to describe this its kind of likeimagine iflike a symphony was on drugs and went to an insane asylumand got attacked by lunaticsand kind of kept on playin their instruments while being ripped apartand then somehow wound up crashing through the wall of a classy english dinner partywho didnt notice what was going on and just went about their businessoh my godit just doesnt stopthis music has induced a complete 5 skull rating cloudnightmare in my head its making me feel really ill i know what its like to be on drugs now either that or hades its getting so chaoticworseeverysecondwhew its over i feel completely drained morris peed on the basement floor i guess he needed to get outside and i was stuck in a trance for nearly 10 minutes that stuff could make you go crazy for real this probably sounds normal to people on drugs dad if grandpa knew what you were listening to back then he would have beat the crap out of you that made me feel worse than any marilyen manson song ever did dont ask me how but that music was drugs and to close it out they cool it off with a soothing disneyrocker as if that could help you forget the cloudnightmare i dont feel good by the way the record looks really great in allblack laterhowardtuttlemancom|0
all the best music in bttf 2 was rehashed from the score to the original film  this is good actually since for many years a lot of the good music from bttf was never released such as the opening bars of hoverboard chase  which is identical to the skateboard chase from part 1 its just not as good because skateboard chase had biffs motif which was way more exciting than the stuff silvestri wrote for the second half of hoverboard chase the  score is performed with great energy especially in the main and end  titles and there are a few interesting moments scattered throughout the  score  these include tracks 3 7 the beginning of 10 and 12  11 is good  but it is merely notefornote a repeat of the clocktower sequence the  rest of the score consists of a lot of boring atmospheric strings a lot of  repetitive sequences and a marginal motif for alternate 1985  bttf 2 is not nearly as great innovative or original as the first score the recording also suffers from severe poor sound quality and lacks the expansive sound of the first bttf its obvious from listening to this that alan didnt have much time to compose this andor robert zemeckis didnt provide much direction as to what he wanted apparently zemeckis just told alan here im busy doing bttf 3 right now  so just write whatever for the second one  audiences wont tell the difference anyway  it is a good cd to have if you  love the trilogy and want all the music but to suggest this score is anything more than a halfbaked hack job is a joke|0
while some of his jokes are amusing listening to fat jokes for an hour is boring all of his material is about being fat and eating very shallow talent pool|0
i tripped across this band while hunting through hundreds of amazon samples for something new and interesting man i went through a lot of rubbish before hitting flyleaf i instantly ordered the ep and full release in my opinion the full release is superior to the ep in production quality and depth but the ep especially fully alive is more gutsy the style of fully alive and sorrow is superior to im so sick kittie on a good day and perfect cranescurve on a bad day|1

hooray for the singable songs collection with 3 cds this collection is a must for any parent whose child loves music  my daughter 2 years will go to the cd player and demand more music mommy when the cd ends  she loves to dance and sing to the simple fun tunes|1
most tribute albums are pretty bad its a fact of life and you know what those bad tribute albums sound like sgt pepper compared to this one bands youve never heard of and will never hear again most of whom cant play a lick do their own versions of rem songs that are often unrecognizable about the only listenable cut is an italian version of pretty persuasion  ive owned over 1000 albums over my lifetime this is one of the 10 worst|0
this cd requires several listening sessions before formulating an entire opinion initially i was a little mixed about it but after listening multiple times i have come to view it as one of rushs best studio works in quite a while certainly new fans will appreciate the musical talent of rush as a 3member act with this work but true longtime impartial rush fans will also recognize that leelifesonpeart are still at the top of their gamei had read a few reviews mentioning how geddy lee can no longer sing in the same range as he used to and also how the mixed result of this cd sounded as if it was pieced together while it is probably true that geddys voice is not the same as 30 years ago the same can be said for bono jon anderson robert plant and anyone else who had an exceptional range stillinall geddys voice is strong in this work and the musical synergy of the trio more than makes up for any perceived loss of range one is too busy listening and enjoying than worrying about what keys that rush is playing in to accommodate geddys vocal rangei listened on both homecar stereos and could not tell where the music was heard as being pieced together frankly i was too busy focusing on the music which is a 12song effort also perhaps i am just not that adept at being able to tell the difference at whether or not geddy and alex were in the studio at the same time that neil was recording his tracks in essence who cares the music is definitely seamlessmy initial reaction about the musicianship was that it was stellar  among the best that rush has ever done neil peart introduces some new drum rhythms geddys bass playing is phenomenal and alex lifeson incorporates new ideas new textures and new sounds that he hasnt really used before one gets a sense of the cohesion and chemistry that rush has enjoyed over the last 40 years of making music together it is a rarity and one that has put them on a welldeserved high pedestal in the world of progressive rock surprisingly many songs on this cd have a harder drive and in general are more hardrocking compared to some of rushs past work not bad for the three who each have to be close to 60 years oldi wont go into what each song means just know that its professor peart hard at work waxing poetic about the purported theme of the albumin a young mans quest to follow his dreams he is caught between the grandiose forces of order and chaos he travels across a lavish and colorful world of steampunk and alchemy with lost cities pirates anarchists exotic carnivals and a rigid watchmaker who imposes precision on every aspect of daily lifeeach song on this cd is catchy in its own respect but some favorites here are the anarchist carnies seven cities of gold the wreckers headlong flight and the garden the garden has a softer balladlike approach and demonstrates the vastness of creativity in rush in fact the garden is a significant achievement for them in their own right  it juxtaposes the rest of the hardrocking album with a final softer more humanistic song replete with string ensemble about the fragility of life and how easily personal achievements are lost from one moment of being to the next when i hear this song and compare it to the entire history of rush it marks a particular high maturity and importancethe more i listen to this cd the more hooked i am although i saw merit in vapor trails and snakes and arrows as i do in all of rushs music clockwork angels has so much more going on musically there are so many new ideas incorporated that i find myself constantly vascillating between the heavy rapid pounding beat of headlong flight and the balladlike wellorchestrated the garden in my daily activities headlong flight has the tempo of bastille day fly by night and analog kid signals and to me is borderline metal the same applies to much of alexs playing on ca and it is really refreshing to see how rush has evolved as a band by the same token they have put a lot of musical effort into this work and should be given proper due they could have packed it in and retired many times in the past 1015 years but they have taken the risks and surpassed them by farthose who are still living in rushs past days eg tom sawyer subdivisions as some reviewers seem to be will not appreciate this work as much as those who can objectively listen the musical architecture of clockwork angels reflects three legendary musicians with extraordinary musical vision who march to the beat of their own musicon a final note the use of keyboards is also reintroduced on this work in a tasteful but not overbearing manner overall rush has put together a very formidable respectable effort on clockwork angels|1
i bought this to hear the children sing but i was disapointed because the musicans overwhelmed the voices|0
few would disagree about the fact that the wall would figure in the 10 best albumsthis terrific double album has sold more than 23 million copies to date on strengths of masterpieces like comfortably numb and another brick in the wallrecommended|1
i can understand that if youre all about waters you have good reason to love the album it has very high production value and hes lead vocals in all but one song not now john  which is my favorite by fari can see the appeal but i dont know if ill ever be able to get into it for the following reasonsthe first 75 of the album sounds like the more somberpreachy tracks from the wall but not as easy to relate to i think they had their place in the wall but so many of them back to back was painful for me waters emotion felt forced and his tone became monotonous that little whisper he does at the end of several lines was driving me slightly nuts by the 4th track or soit didnt feel like a pink floyd album it felt like a waters album it may be unfair of me to think this way but i couldnt help but feel his ego through my headphonesthe album is incredibly direct in its criticism of war  much more so than even the wall im not saying thats good or bad for a first listen but its not something id be able to listen to more than once every couple of monthsoverall i think my review is biased based on my slightly bent opinion of waters but i stand by the fact that this album is too heavyemomonotonous except for the last two tracks which were good for my tastes|0
the majority of this album sucksyou can digitally remaster it all you want but it doesnt make bad music any betterhowever i do like  ussr birthday and guitar gently weepsbut not worth buying a double album to get these songsskip this and go with the 1 hits|0
like alot of the other reviews have said this is one of mwss best and yet it is so overlooked i absolutely love it unfortunately my parents lost the cassette years ago and it is a while since ive heard it im going to buy to hear it again because it is just great maybe the fact that you hardly ever heard of it was part of its allure it wasnt played to the death i dont know many people who like it or even know of it the songs are wonderful and i as a teenager found a special place in my heart i am sure words i need to say the end of the book bring back great memories and are thoughtful inspiring if you havent heard this album  get it|1
this album absolutely blows away snakes and arrows not only do you have a jamming rush but the melodic as well the song headlong fight is definitly the best song on the album probably one of the best songs that they put out in a while the melodic side is back the songs halo effect the wreckers and the garden have an atmospheric sound that will send chills through you as you listen there is not a bad song on the album compared to finding a good song that will stick to you on snakes and arrows they have come along way with their music and hopefully they will make more this cd gives me faith in the bands new music form again i hope it continues you can only wish them well see you at the show in philly|1
ok this is an rock opera and this one togher with the whos 2 epic master pieaces tommy the firs rock opera everand quadrophenia are the 3 best rock operas ever created and this one have no problems to breath the same air as the whos 2 magnum opusit is a very beautiful album with very strong songs not any weak moments everything fits togheter perfectly yust like it shuld doit have some hits on it to like another brick in the wall part 2 and comfortably numb i dont realy know what more to say its great belive me i have owned it for some years now and i have had many great lisenings with it very priceles and timeles music that never grows old higly recomended|1
from the moment i heard the horrible song mother i didnt want to hear any more of this bandbutunfortunatly my friend was listening to this cd and as i thoughtthis cd was really badi dont really know why people like pink floydall of the songs are slowboringand i couldnt find the message that people say it hasafter my listening experience of a half hour of pinkfloyd i dont want to hear it again|0
when i first bought this album in 1984 my daughter was only two there are few childrens artists that i can stand for more than one or two songs  raffi was one and cathy fink was another  the songs on this album are a sheer delight whether youre a kid or just a kid at heart fink plays a variety of instruments banjo guitar and accordian and possesses a wonderful voiceoften accompanied by the children from taylor school in arlington va personal favorites are the traditional new river train along with grandma slid down the mountain the yodel polka and id like to be a cowgirl you gotta love a song with the refrain  id like to be a cowgirlbut ooh im scared of cowsmoo moo moo how they scare me on long family trips in the car this ones a winner note in 1978 she cut a wonderful little record with likeminded musician duck donald a collection of old timey tunes including songs written by the delmore brothers the louvin brothers among others unfortunately its out of print but worth tracking down very highly recommended|1
this is a great cd  probably the best one they have done in a long long time  i am glad to see that they still have it|1
this cd looks good in a garbage cangod awful what were they thinking oh yeah they were wasted when they recorded this crapthey werent thinking|0
have you seen this odd disc and wondered what it was well wonder no more its just a quick hack job doubtless meant to cash in on aphex twins reputation that somehow manages to exploit both the artist and his fans specifically it contains three singles  on ventolin and donkey rhubarb thats it there arent any bonus tracks live tracks new tracks or anything special whatsoever oh wait  i forgot that the last track respect list is one that doesnt appear anywhere on any other aphex twin release too bad that it consists only of thirtyeight seconds of computerized voices reciting a bunch of names thats it thats the whole track now tell me was there any point to including it other than to lure fans into buying the discits also not a point in the discs favour that one of the three singles contained within it is ventolin one of aphex twins weakest moments in general and probably his worst single the original song is lets face it awful and none of the remixes are good either but even aside from that this cd doesnt even feature the three singles in their entirety it lacks two bsides from the on single to say nothing of the remix of the title track and one from donkey rhubarb  although i might add there was enough space for all of these songs left on this cd completists thus are left unsatisfied and have to hunt down the original singles anyway the rest of us have to pay an exorbitant amount of money to wade through piles of frequently unlistenable nonmusic like 73yips one of aphex twins worst creations and thus of course the only one of the on bsides that wea bothered to include on this cd to get to the few good partswhat really irritates me though is the fact that all of the above points notwithstanding fans will still have to buy this disc why because ever since the donkey rhubarb single went out of print its the only easily available cd that contains donkey rhubarb and pancake lizard two of aphex twins finest moments as well as a good alternate version of icct hedral thats quite possibly better than the one on i care because you do the disc also contains on another of afxs best songs  in fact its the first track on here no doubt meant to serve as bait  but its widely available for a far more reasonable price on its own stillinprint single to summarize wea have done everything they could do to make fans buy this disc and nothing to actually ensure their satisfaction they should be ashamed of themselves for doing this and so should warp for letting them do it|0
this recording includes a disclaimer  although the manufacturer claims to have expended considerable technical effort in resurrecting this performance the results are horrid there are loud pops whizzes cracks and snaps at times the pitch wavers monumentally horowitz is not even at his best in the tschaikowskyif you want to hear that you need the bruno walter recording purchase this recording at your own riskand then only if you are a diehard horowitz fanatic willing to suffer greatly for your devotion|0
i gave this a listen  it is little more than another of gilmours boring solo albums  its pretty sad when one of the better guitarists has to fool  the public by using a prestige name in order to get his solo album heard  furthermore this album is atrociously boringhe shouldnt use the name  pink floyd and neither should any other former member of the band for that  matter  two stars out of kindness to gilmour but what a gyp|0
i cannot review warm  tender because the seller never sent the cd to me after i purchased it from amazon over one month agog johnson|0
great cd i am nineteen years old and dont generally listen to piano music but i got this as a gift and i love it the music is beautiful but also fun to listen to because the songs are familiar to me the selection is great because the songs are from a variety of movies you are bound to recognize most of them definitely a fun cd for kids and adults|1
the main problem with true believer is that its dominated by producer alan shacklock whose sympathies are clearly not in line with the kind of artist keaggy is capable of beingit is shacklock not keaggy who has the largest share of performing credits on the disc  shacklock writes 3 songs of which 2 the title track  only you are bland and commercial in the most dumbeddown way  the 3rd have mercy lord at least manages to be a decent rocker  he also gives keaggys original salvation army band from a fan club cassette and never released on cd an updating a word that should be kept far far away from music like keaggys its not bad in and of itself but its not the great song keaggy wrote in the first place  shacklock also seems to have a strange idea of how to record backing vocals as this track demonstrates clearlythe version of be thou my vision here is interesting and would work pretty well for keaggy except that the producer has let a botched vocal take slip through save that thy art  and on that day one of the best songs is a lovely christmasrelated tune  but son of man is ultimately the only track here that really feels like true keaggythe remake of the survivor the original version of which would only see cd release after this album came out is unnecessary layering way too much production on a song that really doesnt need it  the song does benefit somewhat though from the newly aggressive vocal on the last verse and the cathartic extended jam tacked onto the endoverall worth exploring for dedicated keaggy fans but definitely not the place to see what keaggy is about|0
as many have already said the song quality is not balanced some sound great but others sound better in monohowever my reason for giving this a low rating is because of their paininthe butt copyguard protection if you plan on listening to this cd on your computerforget it it worked fine in a dvd player or stereo but when i went into my office and put it into my computer all i could access was a video documentary the cd would not play the songs on the album and the company did not provide a way to do it considering that i and millions of others use their computer as their main stereo i consider this to be a big problem as it turned out my less than 30 audioediting software could easily read the tracks and i copied them to my  computer so i can listen to it whenever i wanti bought four of the remastered albums and i was planning on buying more but after the above i wont purely on principle in this day and age to have to jump through hoops to listen to a cd on a computer after buying it is ridiculous|0

i dont know what i was thinking  one day i had the urge to buy this album i thought that i was somehow not fulfilling some sort of duty by not owning it  ive never been a big fan of the film or play but its such a part of the culture of a certain era that i simply had to own it  as it turns out i was wrong its not a very interesting cd even as a cultural relic|0
i bought the cd because i watched david gilmour on aols sessions archive and they played comfortably numb i love that song  this cd is a disappointment  even comfortably numb sounds better sung by david and his band then it did back in 1979save your money  this is just more of roger waters ranting and raving  he for some reason wanted to be a looney and that certainly comes acrossi hope david and his present band make and album with old pink floyd favorites  they are so much better now both vocally and accoustcally|0

listen this was not an album of our times or the 80s  this is an album of the human condition  lets see if you can follow me on thisas we age life teaches us many times harshly that to wear your heart on your sleeve is not condusive to continued mental or emotional health  so as we grow we build many walls around ourselves in order to protect our psyches from damage  we all do it  we surround ourselves with consumer  having bought into the madison ave bull that it will us happy  but with all the walls up we cant get to that which we most need  real human connection  how many of you are living beyond your means  for what  look at all the posturing out there all the posing  its all about attitude no substance which is why people look at this album and say what a downer man  its sooooo depressing like why bring us all down  lighten upits ok stay in your own little world and live for yourself  if you have a mind you might see that the truth within this album applies to everyone  while your at it look up the word allegory  it may help you to understand|1
on the outlook slashs second solo effort and the first one under the exhaustive band name slash feat myles kennedy  the conspirators apocalyptic love is in a way much more of a slash album than the 2010 solo release was which was more of an experimental album in which slash was playing with different singers and the result was nothing short of fantastic and ambitious slash was one of my favorite releases of 2010 and i enjoyed it and played it a lot that year and since  myles kennedy sang two songs on slashs solo debut and his vocals fitted the songs very well i wasnt aware of him or alter bridge before and learned about him through that album slash announced a tour which would have myles kennedy as the singer i liked his voice but i found myself wondering if he could sing all of slashs previous bandsprojects guns nroses and of course the new album with different singers the answer is yes myles could handle all vocal duties and proved to be a very capable singer the 2011 made in stoke live album certainly asserts that and more the selftitled album was interesting because it featured a variety of different singers and more experimentation apocalyptic love sees slash going back towards what is he is known for and thrives on this one is more raw backtobasics and straightforward type of deal with one singer throughout and a more classic rock fueled straight ahead rock nroll vibethe title track kickstarts the album and is more or less what you would expect from slash  classic rock styled sound with a nice breakdown not that theres anything wrong with that it works quite well and the song itself is great  one last thrill sees kennedy going for a johnny rotten type of rant fast paced and with the speedy riff its one of the faster songs on apocalyptic love something about the punkishriff and attitude mixed with myles vocal delivery  standing in the sun has a great summer feel to it its slightly on the softer side but it works and ends up as different track with a great just chillin attitude and was one of the highlights for me youre a lie was a good choice of single its fast heavy catchy and the riff is terrific the track is explosive and is in your face only praises for this one no more hero has a fantastic guitar riff that makes me happy just by hearing it actually it sound a little like sweet child meets 8 but video games music as weird as that may seem and a delightful chorus halo is one of my favorites and has teeth and attitude its been praised by many and the praises have been earned  myles sounds really great on this one we will roam has a nice chorus going for it and while it doesnt stand out is a very good song as well with a neat soloanastasia deserves all the praises its been receiving so far without a doubt one of the highlight of al and it starts out with classical with a touch of flamenco flavored guitar building towards another terrific riff and ends up being the great epic of the album at 8 minutes this life is more of a solitude song and it works very well at that i liked the devil and me kind of lyrics here a tip to the hat of some great blues guitarist the rest of the album is not bad either please believethe deluxe edition digipack has extra songs in my opinion crazy life should have been included on the album to begin with its at least as good the rest and one my favorite songs overall theres also a dvd thats a making of which offers a pretty cool behind the scenes look its a great view of the creating process for fans its not essential shall i say but hardcore fans will find this interesting and its fantastic to see them tune up and work those songs and see them fool around and play theres also a code for a free slash apocalyptic love tshirt the shirt is 2499 they ask you to pay for shippingapocalyptic love is not an outstanding effort and i cant say that it blew me away but its a very good effort from slash myles  co and there are some tracks here that i will keep playing for some time i am sure of that there are 13 tracks on the regular version and while none of them are bad i have the feeling that had the album been somewhere around three tracks shorter it would have been stronger as it runs a tad overlong sometimes less is more ironic considering i bought the deluxe edition slashs backing band is tight and it seems that he found a stable hard working unit in these musicians and its apparent that these guys have fun playing together  slash has a great partner in myles kennedy and id like to see them do work some more together with apocalyptic love slash plays the kind of music he loves to play and it clearly works  45 stars|1
this album shows a wide range of styles and directions but rarely seems to put it all together for me  to start barcarole has a good bass line but doesnt seem to form a coherent melody to this fan of more traditional jazz  are you is pleasant enough and au lait conjures up images of a rainy day in my minds eyeeighteen is the best of the lot for my tastes coherent and up tempo  it would be nice to hear this done as what the late chuck niles called straightahead jazz  im afraid that the title track offramp is not for me  i would call it schizophrenic but even schizophrenics have a sense of direction sometimes  james comes back to earth with a decent melody and more prominent piano work by lyle mays  finally the bat pt 2 sounds like it could be a good movie theme albeit with the same rainyday overtones of au laiti will no doubt be excoriated by the pmg fanboiz and i really wanted to like this but it just doesnt move me  your mileage may vary|0
brian is one funny guy i could not stop laughing i first heard him during a long flight back from japan and i must have looked like a moron sitting in my chair laughing as hard as i was there were tears running down my face  that was 2 years ago  ive been looking for this cd ever since  i finally got my copy  listened to the whole thing driving from san antonio to austin and just cracked up the whole way  it was almost dangerous for me to be on the roadhe reminds me of what my life was like growing up  back then a lot of it seemed pathetic but now it seems pretty darn funnygreat cd  youll like it  no foul language too  thats a real plus these days|1
preface lifelong rush fan canadian have all their albums last one i truly loved was presto since then some ok songs some not so much vapor trails  dont know because i cant hear the songs through the awful mix sa some highlights some lowlights ok all caught up ill proceed with my review of clockwork angels which i will attempt to get through without referencing any other rush albums because they all stand on their own meritas the title suggests i almost missed out caravan didnt do anything for me when i heard it 2 years ago bu2b was good saw them on the time machine tour and as usual they sounded great then heard headlong flight and wasnt impressed because of these factors i approached the release of clockwork angels very cautiously i apologetically admit the fascinating name of the album and the artwork 2112 genius really drew me in even though the initial 3 songs didnt even more apologetically i admit after first listen i was disappointed as i sadly somewhat expected to be except for the garden more on that later the hooks werent there the melodies werent there the musicianship as always was brilliant but each member seemed to be disjointed from the other 2 i heard no great alex lifeson guitar riffs no soaring melody in geddy lees voice ok neil peart is always neil peart but even he seemed reserved after a second listen i was prepared to write the album off put it on the shelf with all the other rush albums and only listen to the garden then a funny thing happened i woke up one morning with the riff from the anarchist stuck in my head i even identified what song it was i listened to it again on the way to the rink im a college hockey coach canadian remember and to my own surprise melodies and memorable riffs were everywhere i listened to it all day on repeat in my office and it got better and better each time thats when it hit me theres so much going on musically on this album it just takes a few listens for everything to be fully absorbed clockwork angels is truly truly brilliant this is a work of musical art on so many different levels as unimpressed as i was by the 3 initial singles they seemed energized by being part of the story im gonna assume you all know the conceptstory the album tells by now from all the other reviews cliffnotes version steampunk kid travels the world experiences life love and loss lives and learns cant wait for the book that may be the most impressive thing about this masterpiece in todays singledriven music scene rush have revived the album 12 songs that work so well together it makes the whole greater than its parts yet each song is so different you cant believe how well they all fit together this is also an argument for physical cds i cannot imagine not having the elegiac sweeping cover art and the lyric booklet to look at while i listen to the music while caravan will never be one of my favourite rush songs it still has layers i didnt hear 2 years ago bu2b is far better than i initially thought and it provides the perfect launch point for the title track an epic in itself the anarchist features some of alex lifesons best work in years although for me he is the star of this album he provides whatever each song needs sometimes understated simple riffs sometimes aggressive blistering crushing licks but each time its exactly what the song needs while i initially thought pearts drumming was reserved i realized that he as well was playing what was best for the song there are a ton of great only neil peart fills that become more evident with every listen hes still the greatest drummer on earth carnies is a tremendous song very unlike whatever notion its title may evoke and halo effect is one of the better simple accoustic slower songs the band has ever done its touching and it conveys that point of the story very effectively seven cities of gold is heavy lifeson rips this song up from start to finish yet lees bass gets a chance to really groove during the bridge again lee is forever the most underrated bassist alive the wreckers is one of my favourite rush songs ever its a great listen very accessible and its got more melody in its 5 minutes than an entire day of top 40 radio these days lee turns in that vocal performance that i missed initially in a perfect world the wreckers is a hit song we all know this world isnt perfect so ill just settle for it being a close to perfect rock song headlong flight is propelled by a great lee bassline and great powerful drumming by peart wish them well is a great song lyrically but along with caravan it musically is a bit below the rest of the album i really dont know what i can say about the garden it immediately moved me upon first listen and has only gotten stronger since i know it says a lot but the garden is possibly the best song rush has ever done musically beautiful with perfect orchestration and an emotional powerful solo by lifeson one of his best ever lyrically if this song doesnt stir you emotionally you dont have a soul i tear up everytime i hear it its a perfect example of what music can do for us as an artform the notes by peart about the song in the booklet are stirring even moreso when you consider what he went through i myself am battling a lifethreatening illness and the lyrics of this song resonate so strongly for me it makes an already timeless song even more powerful rush fan or not nobody should miss the garden it is the best song this band has ever done and should quiet anyone who suggested rush wasnt the band they once were im listening to this album as i write this and im still hearing some small flourishes within songs that i hadnt heard yet clockwork angels is a masterpiece its an album that many rush fans knew the band still had in them yes i didnt get it at first and i almost missed out on its brilliance i read all the negative reviews and most are opinions i shared after my initial listens its been said this could be their last studio album if so they end on a higher note than most bands could ever aspire to let alone a band in its fifth decade with members in their 60s and no other band could ever end a career with a more powerful song than the garden everything about this album is amazing the songwriting the lyrics pearts best ever imo the musicianship the artwork clockwork angels is a masterpiece period please dont make the mistake i almost did get this let it reveal itself over time and you will in no way be disappointed|1
i agree with mr hazelwood  this recording is lack luster and i usually like michael murrays recording too much brass and no organ  i agree that columbia sony should rerelease the e power biggs music or organ brass and percussion that is the best recording and the correct mixture of instrments i have heard in a long time i recently sent them columbia an email making that request  maybe if they get enough emails they would know that we demand the best of the best|0
i love hellraiser i love the lead cenobitepinhead i love clive barker and the work he influences i love the mythology of the hellraiser seriesi hate this movie  mind you the intentions behind it were clearly good  pete atkins wrote it so you know the guy was in it for fun and love of horrorbut the ultimate carryout is terriblethe acting is by far the worst of the entire seriesi mean yikes did they even try to get a good cast the cenobites have crap conceptualization behind them the terry cenobite burns people with her cigarettes pointless the camerahead cenobite has a cameraheadand sucks because of it  the effects are shoddy and the whole picture looks like it was staged and carried out in a matter of days amateur work at best its a shame to say it but this is not a good picturehellraiser gave us solid story and characters and a creepy concept of a hell taken over by this new breed of demons  the cenobites the aforementioned demons are geniunely creepy and aweinspiring overall a geniune masterpiece of horror  hellbound hellraiser 2 gave us an expanded mythology of hell and the elements within it a history of the cenobites a study of an infatuation with the occult and strange visuals that despite their eighties feel still work wonderfully in context to the picture  part threestunk and ruined the concept  i suspect its mostly due to inappropriate budget bad actors and the fact that the franchise had moved on to another studio  add to that overuse of the cenobites a plot for those afflicted with add and just laughable production values and you get this tripe  mind you i have been known to love cheesy movies alsobut not when they are supposed to continue a serious and weird vein of films  bad movie with a good heart buy it if you a fan of hellraiser steer clear is you are not|0
a boring album especially when you put it up against dark side of the moon animals meddle piper at the gates and even final cut the lyrics throughout the album are as fantastic as anything they have done  but the melody to welcome to the machine and the title track are dull and too self conscious it seems that they had put their all into the magnificient dark side of the moon and were totally spent to go in and make another album shine on you crazy diamond and to a lesser degree have a cigar with a guest vocal from roy harper who has some pretty classic albums from this period as wellare the only songs that have any redemible qualities from this album and they were so desperate for material the had a shine on crazy diamond part 69 which really was mindless jamming and a reiteration of the original melody but hey its pink floyd a much more admirable album animals had material that was from around dark side album but it has a freshness to it that wish you were here just doesnt have|0
this gets one star only because there is no provision for alower grade the sound quality of this cd is terrible  it sounds like it was taped from a copy of the movie  there are more dialogue clips than music the production standards are not particularly high|0
this is an excellent album if you subscribe to the school of thought where virtuosity in the violin essentially equates to dragging notes and comprehencively ignoring what is written on the page in the name of expressionism i have heard better playing at amateur recitals from violinists half her age i find it rather sad that her label knows this and peddles it anyway plastering her pretty face everywhere in a blatant publicity attempt|0
a must have even if you have the original cd because its probably overplayed anyways  got this for my husband and he loves it so do my kids  awesome|1
waters and gilmour need each other if you could mix final cut and this record at the same time youd have a masterpiece but gilmour an excellent musician was not inspirated as a composer here and hes an  excellent melodist too except on the turning away  fantastic the remaining songs are very acessable and pop dogs of  war is in my opinion the worst floyds song but fortunately  the division bell is a redemption|0
i havent like a rush album in 27 years power windows  this changes that  a really nice album with a strong basis in rushs historic style but with influence from more recent trends from the last 2 decades  it is nice to see them take a departure but retain their unique character|1
i beieve in all fairness the editorial reviewer summarized it and explained it best  if you want to understand the pink floyd you have to have a broad knowledge of history geography listened to all their albums in short have some basic iq a little above a chimps   just saying this album sucks will just make your air head suck   if you listen to final cut album for example you will understand why the roger waters is against the war and how his father was killed during the second world war by a german tiger tank for no good reason to keep a bridge for a few minutes for alies that was going to fall anyway  some idiots would think it is a bengali tiger since the song doesnt mention it is a tank  dont laugh guys if you watch jay leno shows you see people on hollywood blvd who think abraham lincoln is the current mayor of nyc if you are below triple digit  thats ok too buy metallica and turn the volume high if you some moneies left get a few steel rings put on your rings and decorate yourselfthe album is great songs are subtle abstract but great  this is a strong buy  the ltd edition is great too i would also own the final cut i think two of them make better sense |1
again very helpful there was content in this cd that is not totally clear in the book but in listening to the recorfding becomes clear|1
this was a gift for my husband he was very happy to get this cd i was very happy to pay the low price|1
i had expected to hear new songs sung in the sultry voice and excellent english she has used this year  instead the music was obviously recorded long ago in the somewhat screeching voice she used before  please ask her to record some new songs in the beautiful voice she uses this year|0
i really like this album the band is very tight lots of change ups  tempo changes  some of the heaviest playing i have ever heard rush do yes its a concept album but you can pick any song and just play it musially i think it is the best album they have ever made lyrically 2nd best under 2112 i would say this is there 2nd best album ever they are just playing there guts out on this albumits like there playing while the room is on fire around them because of the concept aspect of the album only lyrically it reminds me of 2112 musically it reminds me of the albums counter parts or snakes  arrows on steroids geddys voice sounds killer on this record  this album shows some of the best music alex  neil have ever done together if you have ever liked just one song rush has done you will like this album|1
i grant it was my fault i should have checked to see if there were any non remastered copies of the beatles magical mystery tour available  i have learned my lesson i had bought an entire set of beatles cds while living in germany ten years ago including a numbered limited edition of the white album 1 million copies these were beautiful records actually cds and even though they were not vinyl for cds they were fantastic however they were lost in transit when i came home i have been slowly rebuilding my collection but the quality of the american versions are horrible and sirhaha george martin has done a disservice to us all in his remastering he has cleaned up things like when pauls voice doesnt quite make that note on lovely rita and his voice breaks a beloved moment for me now gone  however the worst yet is my recently purchased magical mystery tour its bass is so over done and the highs are pumped up it sounds like some group trying to be the beatles and almost but not quite pulling it off  it is all shiny and new and polished but nothing like the original  it also seems to be a tradition to rip off americans on beatles recordings i really wish i had my european beatles cds back the were unremastered and sounded like the records i grew up with why george martin felt he had to clean up these recordings i dont know it is the biggest sin since the evil munchkin felt the beatles needed a wall of sound for their let it be album but for me the magical mystery is the worse by far do yourselves a favor and try to find used cds for all your beatles recordings from now on and especially avoid this one it is the worst of the lot so far why sir martin why you would never had gotten away with it if john was still here  whats next removing revolution 9 from the white album because its odd and most people dont like it but to be on point it just doesnt sound as good as my old cd and in no way sounds anything like the album i used to havehope this helpsps does anyone know the difference between enhanced and remastered thanksi hope someone wakes up and reisues these recordings as is|0
this collection of songs doesnt even scratch the surface of all the original music in the rankin bass library i found an alternative this year to waiting for warner or whoever owns them now find a program that allows you to extract audio from the dvds and then create your own soundtracks you can even find album art and tag the songs for each movie have a holly jolly christmas|0
great record little hints of axel in myles voice on a number of songs well worth listening to over and over again even if you were not a gr fan this record should be heard by all|1
i have a copy of the original white album but thought it might be nice to hear a new vinyl pressingimpressive packaging and sleeves but the record skipped upon further examination i realized the records both were warped really i have 40 year old albums in better shape do yourself a favor and but some vintage vinyl it sounds great and will probably be in better shape when you put it on the turntablenewer is definitely not better in this case|0
you could say its a sign of a life welllived but the purchase of this album 16 years ago my very first cd was the biggest disappointment of my lifeif you read the packaging youd think you were getting a compilation of some of the best science fiction soundtracks ever  instead youre getting one loser playing electrorock remixes of famous melodies on a crappy synthesizerit was the first week of 6th grade and the store said no refunds on opened merchandise  mom wouldnt buy it back from me so i could spend my money on some magic cards insteadi went to my room and cried|0

of course gens is her usual brilliant self and everyone apart from felix seems to be in good form i was so disheartened by what i heard from felix i searched out the gramophone magazine review and their reviewer was aghast too saying the man is quite simply out of tunehearing is believing|0
this album is pretty damn silly  first off  if your going to link yourself to eno whether its a joke or not i really cant tell then you better deliver the goods  the pieces are generally short like enos music for films but they usually dont go anywhere and certainly dont leave you wanting more  there are a couple of decent moments worth wading through some garbage to get to but this cd will soon be at my local used cd store  maybe itll be worthwhile for someone if they cough up 5  oh  there are a couple of tablets on the back jacket maybe sumerian that are interesting  much like the album though they dont seem to serve any purpose|0

i am halfprepared to believe in any recording that has such a wondrous cover  the planet neptune  but my admiration goes no deeper when someone mentions this recording i reach for my luger its junkif you like your bruckner 6 to be a stiched together from various live performances b where the acousic noticeably changes within a movement c the orchestra is lacklustre and d even a semimaligned recording from a predecessor has more magic to it herbie 1980 then this recording is for you cherish itthere are much better recordings on offer sawallish klemperer nagano herbie somewhat and hell even the truncated furtwangler from 1943danny has made some wonderful recordings but this is not one of them and the luger says no as well|0
bought it for my grandson and he loves it  actually so do i  good tunes and good concepts too|1
this cd is great it contains over 400 lakota words organized according to the lessons in the textbook it really helps to look at how the words are spelled when you first listen to the cd i listen to every lesson several times while looking at the words then i take the cd in my car and listen again imagining the words and the pictures each word is printed on a picture of the thing it represents so it is a great way of learning both pronunciation and meaning i also have the level 2 and it goes much further in teaching pronunciation the writing system is great and it is based on the standard lakota spelling used in thenew lakota dictionary wowapi kin lena e na nagoyapi kin lena lila wasteste|1
previous reviewers have attested to the excellent sound on this cd i concur it is outstanding so is the orchestral playingin other respects i disagree with those reviewers ravesthe cds annotator notes that mackerrass recordings of the two symphonies are among the fastest on recordings that is true the allegro of the militarys 1st movement is taken at a presto clip that leaves one breathless  or better gives one not a second to savor a moment before another moment comes cascading ini have about a dozen recordings of each of these works ive listened to mackerrass four times i doubt ill listen to them ever again|0
i purchased this cd particularly for the duet from the pearl fishers which was lovely however the rest of the cd with a few exceptions comprises a majority of unfamiliar ariasduets that are frankly quite boring why do they always seem to do this with these operatic selections there are so many beautiful arias to choose from very disappointing|0

note that amazon is selling two albums as the soundtrack of exodus  one is titled exodus the other is titled exodus ost 1960  amazon is using the same set of reviews for both albums in spite of the fact that the albums have wildly different track times and the second one has two extra tracks  most important however is that exodus has lush sound quality while exodus ost  1960 sounds like it was digitized on the cheap  this album gets one star exodus would get five stars|0

sibeliuss violin concerto is the single piece that started my interest in classical music  i admit i may not have a seasoned ear but i know for certain that i should have paid more attention to the lesser rated reviews  i found many of the notes to be glazed over and muted and didnt have the emotion i would expect  i have not taken the time to listen to the full disc as i was pretty disappointed with what i had initially heard  i cannot believe that people are comparing it to heifetzthe recording quality is excellent though|0
i am a huge sabbath fan  i like all their work except this  forbidden which stands as the absolute worst  this is a close second the title track is by far the best song on it  nightwing is good also but  the rest is just not up to par  try tyr or cross purposes for the better  tony martin era material  the songs are just weak on this release|0
i dont care what anyone says this album blows dark side of the moon out of the water dark side is good but this album is well perfect i love the story and the music is totally awesome i spent so much time trying to pick apart every little aspect of the lyrics to piece the story together and i finally feel like i have it although there is more detail the basic idea is about a symbolic wall that was built up around the character pink the first cd talks about different things that added to this wall hence the titles another brick in the wall parts 1  3 an over protective mother death of his father abusive teachers etc etc whereas i think the second cd is about what is happening inside the wall and the eventual tearing down of the wall the album seems to play almost like a cycle where the music that starts the album ends the album as well hmmm i wonder if that has some meaning ahh well this album is great its full of great music and great literature definately among my top albums of all time|1
there should be much to like in a cd that seeks to educate about gender and gender equality but as other reviewers have noted it just doesnt come together well at any level adult or child coming from the background of wee sing and music together this seems like a somewhat silly vanity project that is past its prime as a musical experience the uneven pacing of music and talking is difficult to navigate not really a problem if you break it out once a decade for a nostalgic spin  but listening to it 23 times a day is unpleasant  like nails on the chalkboard unpleasant fortunately my daughter quickly got bored with it so i was able to rip the 2 or 3 tolerable songs onto a compilation cdin terms of how educational this cd will actually be for your child i recommend the time article free to be boys and girls 40 years after the failed gender revolution before you make a purchasing decision|0
i do think these performances are quite enjoyable  in point of fact this band was originally booked as john gilmores band  ra appeared and performed on electric keyboard adding effects but the piano playing that is central on these pieces is played by another young man whose name escapes me who does sound pretty much exactly like sun ra on the instrument  to me the pieces here form a nice little triad of quality recordings from the late 80searly 90s with blue delight and purple night the music flows and the music speaks its piece|1
i was just out of college when this album came out in the early eighties  everyone i knew tried to like it right out of college everyones broke so no one wants to give in to buyers remorse  i still put it on from time to time to see if my opinion has changed and have bought it multiple times including the 2004 remaster  its really a 25 star album  musically and melodywise its subpar and lyrically its even worse  but its still of interest because of rogers backing group which includes some of the members of pink floyd who cant stand the albumcompared to the other pink floyd releases even the soundtrack lps more and obscured by clouds are much more interesting  however this ones really a roger waters solo album and as such its the best of thosethe problem is that waters solo albums are ahem not exactly greatthere are some people however who enjoy famous rock stars throwing left wing temper tantrums if you like that sort of thing as rolling stone magazine does then this would be your cup of tea|0

sally rogers at quiet oclock is simply wonderful her voice is gentle soothing with a beautiful range the selection of songs is a perfect blend of lullabies and slow paced songs the background is often simple with few  instruments which provides the perfect environment for attending to sally  rogers voice and the song my family has listened to this tape since my  child was an infant i sang these lovely songs for many nights and now my  child sings them to me the range of music is enjoyable for infants and  beyond a classic and a wonderful gift for any parent|1
as this cd is placed under the soloreleases of brian may of queen you think this is also a release made by him my collegue is right  it is not brian of queen this brian may is indeed an australian composer of  filmmusic and died a few years ago i believe of cancer should i have know  this before i would not have bought both the cd and the 2video|0
ive been a fan of tso for a while owning their beethovens last night cd and having heard their christmas music off and on for several years i had read the reviews here however and listened to the cd with no expectations what i heard was good instrumentals but horrible vocals the vocalists are trying very hard to sound operatic and failing the average punk band sounds better than the vocals on a few of the songs which is a real shame consider the spectacular show that they put on liveto anyone who asks i recommend going onto one of many sites where you can purchase individual songs downloading all of tsos instrumental songs from the three christmas cds and burning a cd with those save yourself the grief of the poor vocal performance and buy whats really worth listening torocking christmas music|0
a few years ago when i was in a tv theme phase i got all the televisions greatest hits cds and most of the collection is good but i was disappointed with vol 4 probably because i have never heard the majority of these themes and i was bored with the cd the only themes i have ever heard are lassie make room for daddy father knows best ozzie and harriet davy crocket gunsmoke the fugitive the untouchables and candid camera the rest are tv shows that i have never seen syndicated reruns of so i dont know their themes i guess a person should just stick with the televisions greatest hits cds that have themes of tv shows that they actually grew up watching or saw on nick at nite or tvland|0
wow i have to honestly say this album rocks and that is a really nice thing in a world inundated with rap and rb not that i have anything against those 2 musical stylesits just that the world america especially is filled with trendy people who are like rats following the pied piper whatever is in at the time is what they like if a certain artist or sound is hotthey like it i have never subscribed to this mentality and thank god slash hasnt either the same cannot be said for his former gnr partner axl rose we gave him the benefit of the doubt and waited for his new gnr lineup to prove their worth and we waited and waitedfinally after over a decade we got chinese democracywtf samples loops and super over production with ballad after ballad and nary a rocker in sight yesthe opening track rocked a bit but has more in common with punk than the sleazy rr we were used to with gnr the only track that stood out for me was better axlyou have failed us if it took you that long to write and release the album it should have been track after track of masterpieces now here comes slash while he has been with us all along and released some pretty damn decent stuffthis is the definitive album by the man it is by far the most cohesive album in his solo arsenal it rocks it rolls it has all of the elements that made gnr what it was what slash needed was a steady singernot a bunch of guestsand he chose well im sure it had much to do with myles kennedy showing his stuff on slashs last release in shortapocalyptic love can be considered the gnr album we have waited almost 15 years for i wont go into a track by track description because wed be here all day all i will say is this is hard rocking music at its finest with a fantastic vocal performance from mr kennedy axl has nothing on this guy so if your like me and you long for the gnr of yore and you also were majorly let down by that lame guns  posers albumdont walkrun to the nearest music store and grab this cd or just click that mouse right here and now on amazonyou wont be dissapointed thank you slash|1
it is one of the best story albums ever  sadly  my copy arrived badly warped  returns on amazon are no problem so i got my money back i look forward to ordering again in the dead of winter|1
yes you can meditate is amazing i truly love it  i never thought i could learn to meditate on my own  but i learned with these cds  tildet has the most beautiful soothing voice and is such a great teacher  meditation has made a big difference in my life  having faced some major medical conditions i knew i had to make changes in my life  i am eating better exercising and meditating  i feel great never better and i owe a lot of that to tildet and these amazing cds  i highly recommend them to anyone who wants to learn meditation including people who already meditate i promise you it will make a huge positive difference in your life|1
i think the fact that this soundtrack cd is selling here on amazon for as little as 30 cents speaks volumes about its musical content and value  this has to be the worst film score ever written by anyone  i have not seen the film holly vs hollywood but i cannot imagine this so called music being anything but a deterrent to any movie unfortunate enough to be backed by this dribble intrada should be ashamed of themselves releasing such trash it is not even worth 30 cents|0
but wow not a bad album the production is top notch i like tracks 6 7 8 and 13 the album has some really wild solos i didnt know slash was still in his prime replace that singer with somebody good and this album would really rock|1
unlike the reviewer below i believe that frederic chiu was wisely shown the exit after the second round of the van cliburn competition  certainly his technical powers as a pianist are undeniable but a thinking musician who allows the music to speak naturally without disruptive and individualistic statements he is not as is sadly the case with many young performers these days we are first made aware of chius abilities and only afterward are we allowed to hear the beauty of mendelssohns music  and beautiful music it is anyone who has heard these works in the hands of a great musician like perahia will hear at once the chasm that stands between such selfless interpretation and the land of chiu menham pressler said at the competition i want to meet another lover of music i dont want to meet another player perhaps this disc is the best explanation for chius failure in fort worth  buy it if you want to hear him and not mendelssohn|0
beautiful playing gorgeous sound  that will only take us so far  abbados rhythms have no spring to them the orchestral colors are homoganized the whole thing sounds slack  this isnt just a matter of tempi although abbados are on the slow side  its a matter of vision  abbado here gives us an overlyromatic nonideomatic interpretation  theres little here of the brahms who took long walks smoked cigars and had to make his own coffee because noone else made it strong enough for him  theres even less of the brahms who sought the fusion of romantic sentiment into classical form ive played this symphony and listened to many interpretations and this is one doesnt suit my taste or what i read in the notes i played  for a bracing alternative check out klemperers account on emi or walters or horensteins  even bernstein gives us more authentic brahms than this  two stars for the orchestra and engineers|0
this is an excellent double album by pink floyd i would say if you are new to floyd maybe buy wish you were here or dark side of the moon first but the wall is a must buy quickly thereafter 55 stars this must be part of anyones collection if you are considering buying it do it yeahhmusic just isnt like this anymore i think people are too worried about alienating their audience to make music as good as pink floyd|1
flyleaf shows why they have consistency on the billboard album chart every song shows a passion that lacey and the others have for the music my favorites are all around me and cassie i really love the acoustic version of cassie flyleaf displays their musical prowess by supplying acoustic versions of fully alive red sam cassie im so sick and all around me if you havent picked up this cd pick it up it is worth the money|1
first of all theres no dispute that this is a great album i would give it 4 starsbut this review is not about album content but the remastering of it i had a cassette version and wanted to buy the remastered version from the year 2000 i received the cd that was remastered in 1994 i know there is a difference because when i set my car cd player dial at 11 oclock i get the maximum sound but when its not remastered i do not get sufficient sound at that level i ask the question are there two different remastered copies 1994  2000 or is the wall just a victim of bad remastering|0
loved it|0
i first saw brian regan on the letterman show he killed me but it wasnt enough  the cd is an hour that will have you in hysterics  regans act is so clean my 10 year old has tried to duplicate some of his bits but the humor is so crossgenerational you can share it with all of your friendsive started giving them as gifts and my friends love them  since then weve taken several 4 hour road trips to catch his act in dallaswhat person hasnt lived his nightmare of the day the science project was due  and after listening to the cd your trips to the donut store wont ever be the samemy only complaint is that he hasnt come out with a second cd yet|1
awesome album very well put togetherplain and simple i love her voice not one to write reviewsbut cool sound buy it|1
like a previous reviewer i was expecting this to be like the awesome wanda jackson comp queen of rockabilly but there is absolutely no comparison janis martin has a fine voice and since this was recorded in nashvilleat the bradley barn i think the musicianship is competent what it is lacking is energy and enthusiasm i dont get the sense that she even liked the materialit feels like she was just trying to make a few bucks off the new trend as so many did or being  pushed in that direction by her label to move more units her biggest hit was my boy elvis therein lies the problem she didnt seem to approach rockabilly as anything more than a novelty she didnt have the fire and raw sexual energy that wanda jackson hadbut then again does anybody  i do suspect that she was a fine country singer in a patsy cline mode so if she did record anything like that im sure its great stuff this not so much|0
we really enjoy this album it isnt christmas without this wonderful worship cd so glad we were able to get it|1
this is a review just on the 2010 hallmark rereleaseill be short  not so sweet on this one dont buy this rerelease  buy the original columbia version  on this one the sound is absolutely terrible i dont even think its in stereo i love all the ray conniff christmas albums including christmas with conniff its what i grew up with as soon as i hear any of these it instantly takes me back to my childhood its been many years since columbia originally released this on cd so i thought this might be an upgrade as far as sound goes well the joke was on me  the original sounds fine  totally blows this distorted nasty version away |0
kaka  i agree with the previous review  the singing is whiny and there is no melody  the lead singer has a terrible voice  like nails on a blackboard  i dont know what image this band is trying to convey but they are so clued out  like a bunch of nerds yelling and swearing and trying to be coolthis doesnt sound like alex harvey at all but like a bunch of 10 year olds  the one who wrote that rosebud or something must be deaf  or maybe it was the band themselves that wrote that review hoping to promote the album  in any case its complete garbage and dont waste your money  i wouldnt even take it if i got it for free thats how bad it is|0
probably the least interesting work of leonard rosenman the main theme is nothing more than a variation of his lord of the ringstheme and the other tracks dont really impress  with the possible exception of time travel at 26 minutes not counting in the poptracks its also very short  even for rosenman standardsstill its far from a bad soundtrack but you would probably only buy it to complete your star trekcollection  or in my case your rosenmancollection|0
i am totally hooked on this cd i listen to it several times a week i like some of the tracks that i have not heard on the radio such as bad rain and hard and fast|1
brian regan is an amazingly funny man not only is his act clean enough for everyone but his observations on life are truly on the money and exquisitely made from ridiculous spillandspell names like aymie to psychotic doughnut consumption habits there is no area of american life safe from regani am especially fond of hooked on phonics kids party games donut lady and spider webs and bees although there is not a clunker on the entire cd for truly funny comedy that the entire family can share this cd is impossible to beatnow if youll excuse me i need to go find a doughnut with icing all over it but sprinkles only on one side|1
its a great album from start to finish i would recommend this to anyone who likes a story told from beginning to end through music  a great hard rocking album for 2012 rush still shows that they have a lot of gas in the tank i hope they keep it going the best rock band ever  must have for any new or old fans|1
singers on this cd are ok its just that there is just too much crammed  on it 50 songs on 10 tracks on 1 cd nuff said|0
i first heard im so sick on rock band and thought it was absolutely amazing i decided to listen to the songs on amazon and then finally decided to buy the cd needless to say i was not disappointed it is nice to hear a heavy album at work without having to worry about bleaping out the swear words if you like im so sick you will not be disappointed in the rest of the album|1
when slash released his debut solo album in 2010 it featured a wide and diverse selection of artists from the like of ozzy to fergie lemmy to adam levine as well as spots for nicole scherzinger it was an album that worked well and featured a standout track in by the sword sung by andrew stockdale of wolfmother the album also featured two songs by alter bridge frontman myles kennedy who would also go on to front slashs group for his world tour during which he would sing songs from slashs former bands as well as tracks from the album so every night kennedy would be filling the shoes of axl rose scott weiland andrew stockdale ian astbury and chris cornell it was a job that he performed admiringly as his voice handled all the different ranges so for slashs second album kennedy performs all the tracks it seems like a natural progression and a working relationship has been built up by the two menthe album itself apocalyptic love is a rock fuelled funk filled adrenaline rush of old school rock and roll and its clear from the outset that the album has one intention and thats to rock its an album full of great riffs such as the opening song the title track apocalyptic love with its funk driven riff that has myles kennedy using his full vocal range to drive the song on and features a great sing along chorus one last thrill starts out with a scream in the background before kennedy delivers the lyrics at 100 miles rate its a great piece of punk rock it shows kennedy has many different styles of vocals its also topped off by a trademark slash solo theres some great drumming and bass playing from brent fitz and todd kerns on the song standing in the sun both fitz and kerns are part of slashs live bandthe song anastasia starts out with a gentle flamenco style acoustic guitar think end of double talkin jive before kicking into a sweet child o mine riff and changes again and features a great solo from slash as well as kennedy going from low to high with his vocal bad rain has a pure rock swagger about it with its pounding drums and a grooving riff the first single youre a lie is a good indication of the album with its killer chorus and sleek guitar playing it shows how much the slash and myles kennedy partnership has grownslash seems to have found his perfect frontman foil in myles kennedy and apocalyptic love is an unashamedly full blown rock album one that owes much to slashs 70s rock influences it will be interesting to see where they go from here as the they continue to gel even more slash has stated in recent interviews that making the album was the most fun hes had in a long time and listening to the album its clear to hear the chemistry that they have|1
i have purchased and enjoyed so many super budget laserlight cds i find it somewhat difficult to pan one of their items  but this dvorak 5 is a dud  bad playing by a provincial orchestra heavy handed interpretation and bad recorded sound for this great symphony look elsewhere|0
very wholesome loved her when i was little and was very happy to be able to share it my little one now|1
my husband is a great fan of this music and i ordered it for him pink floyd as a group is one of the best|1
ive know the band from the beginning  im from belton texas and we are very proud of them  this cd is one that should be heard  the sounds of the band and vocals are definetely different from the norm  giving their own style to the sounds  very dedicated in the lord and their music you can really feel it  this is a must listen to a band like this only comes along so often and thats rarely|1
i saw this on tv years ago it was hilarious i thought it was a dvd turns out its just a cd|0
the beatles one heck of a great band millions of people are fans including me but i am not such a big fan about this album the beatles please please me realesed in 1963 is a short snippy and poppy rock album all about relationshipsyawn anyways please please me was recorded in about 585 minutes and took only one day to record its bassicly just a cd representing the songs they played live and many of the songs on here were played live in the studio all the songs just sound the same theres nothing different please please me is bassicly just your average short 245 songs with a little guitar solo bassicly just a normal pop album for that time too some this album is a classic but too me its an album you can afford not to buy the two only really good songs on here are i saw her standing there and twist and shout please please me in my opinion is very overated and on rolling stone magzines list of the 500 greatest albums of all time this album came at 39 before pink floyds masterpiece dark side of the moon what all in all this album is for those who like to listen to early beatles songs or just like all that early 60s late 50s bubblegum pop stuff if you want to buy some actullay great beatles albums that are rock classics go for rubber soul revolver sgt peppers lonely hearts club band the white album and abbey road buy those albums not this one|0
i originally wanted to broaden my musical horizons and look into some older classical rock bands growing up in the 90s and in todays world i dont really get a dose of history the only thing ive ever heard about pink floyd was another brick in the wall and ive never heard about until i watched a movie with the music anyway i bought this cd and i was unimpressed in the beginning and kinda weirded out but it got better and better until i realized this is exactly what im looking for this album is not another cd whre aritsts put a bunch of songs together this is a work of art this whole double disk cd is like one song and this one song has everything from blues to rock to opera to psychedalic its pop sometimes and hard rock other times its like watching a play but actually enjoying the experience very very nice i will be listening for a while|1
its just a copy of the old and very weird sony sacd surround mix the drums are spread out in stereo everything else is coming out of the center channel i didnt notice anything from the rear and there are absolutely no low frequencies in the mix at all they must have misunderstood bassmanagement when they produced this early 51 master the same bass problem exists on the old sony sacd of kind of blue i have to repeat  there are no low frequencies anywhere in the mix the acoustic bass in the center channel sounds like a ukelele with thick stringsto add to the agony the piano is in mono in the center channel along with the tinny bassfor clarity let me say that i have about 300 sacds and with a few exceptions they all sound gorgeous in surround i also know how to set up both my sacd player and my receiver to decode these discs correctlyto their credit the company does mention the origin of the multichannel layer on their website way down at the bottom of the lengthy description unfortunately i neglected to read it they say they included the old sony surround mix for historical purposes they should have let it die a lonely death instead of extending its agony with life support via rereleasethe stereo mix sounds fine and if thats what youre buying this for as many of you are youll be pleased hence the generous 2 stars but if youre buying it for the multichannel experience which is why i buy sacds youll be really really ticked off and your wallet will be thinnermy god i wish i could have gotten my money back|0
actually i bought this cd for my brother who is learning the lakota language  and from what ive heard from him he has said the cd lakhotiya woglaka po  speak lakota level 1 audio cd is an easy way to learn the lakota language|1
im michael w smiths newest and biggest fan i just found out about his music when i attended a christmas tree decorating party in early december 2013 i couldnt wait to get home so i could order every one of his christmas cds i love them all the music is inspiring and breathtakingly beautiful this is what christmas is all about when i was a kid my mother played the harry simeone chorale and the robert shaw chorale that was the music that defined christmas when i was growing up and i still love it to this day now michael w smiths music will define christmas for my kids and grandkids were now into january and im still listening|1
i bought several beatle cds to complete my collection unfortunately i was traveling when they arrived and so did not open the order until after the return by date all the other cds were fine but the help album is defective and will not work on several of my cd drives if you order this cd open and check it immediately or youre out of luck|0
had the album years ago missed it replaced it with the cdas any fan knows its a staple in most libraries|1
remastered crapwe dont want remastered stuff all yall do is compress the music to the point that its almost fubar to make it louder most of the time and the few times where you dont its a toss up if the job was done halfway decent|0
well maybe not a good as moving pictures but pretty damned closewont go in to detail as most other have done a better job that i could the best bits well that would be the wreckers wish them well headlong flight bastille day with a bit of bytor  listen at the 500 mark and of course the garden the last song is nothing like theyve ever done but sounds so rushlikeno band should be able to write a album this good as this stage of their career truly remarkable|1
i was very disappointed with the cd  the cd did not live up to my expectations of what i wanted  the cd did not even have the song that i wanted  very poor quality|0
to my ears this is the most exciting rush album to come along in quite a while its better than their last one snakes  arrows usually it takes me several listens to fully appreciate a new rush album and for the songs to stand out on their own but the impact of clockwork angels was immediate this is an incredible album and im looking forward to listening to it over and over|1
the original soundtrack to the beatles first animated movie yellow sumbarine is filled with six actual beatles songs the rest of the album is george martins original score for the movie yellow sumbarine is probaly one of the beatles worst albums due to the fact two of the six beatles songs on here are taken from other albumsyellow sumbarine revolver all you need is love magical mystery tour the other four songs besides all together now though are great only a northern song was recorded during the sessions for sgt peppers was never realesed on that album and was instead realesed on this album hey bulldog was originally recorded by the band never realesed till this album its all too much was recorded right before sgt pepper was realesed and is a psychedelic jam rare for a band like the beatles tracks 713 are the original score for the movie done by george martin are ok tracks but not at all the beatles whatsoever all in all buy this album if you loved the movie yellow sumbarine want to hear the orignal score or just are in dire need of everything recorded by the beatles yellow sumbarine will and always will be one of the least liked beatles album on the market yet|0
just returned from a concert at the night eagle cafe where the burns sisters appeared accompanied by jim henry  wonderful concert at which we purchased three cds this among them  cant say enough about the  originality of the arrangements and the sincerity of the presentation  the fact that they are sisters is integral to the unity of their  performance  musicianship is superb|1
im a huge pink floyd fan i still cannot put into words how great this album is i have been listening to it for over 20 years i think my first copy was in 82 when i was 8 or 9 years old to go through and break the songs down one by one would take away from the purpose of the album if you listen to this it must be all the way the through sure i can now skip around but that is because i have the thing memorized i dont even think i can name favorites because at one time or another every song except the story pieces was a favorite the vocals as with anything pink floyd releases are less important then the actual words the music nothing compares to this it has more of the roger waters feel to it then any other release except the final cut you can talk all day about concept albums the whos tommy queen night at the opera and genesis lamb lies down on broadway come to mind but none compare to the wall you get the story of a young man who is named pink the songs weave a story of his overprotective mother infidelity and loads of paranoia this is roger waters masterpiece sure i am a bigger fan of david gilmour but roger shows that he had a touch of syd barrettesque genius please do not buy this and only listen to another brick in the wall or comfortably numb listen to it all the way through i find it works perfect at work the lady in the cubicle next to mine has even started to like it i heard her singing some of it the other day i still do not consider this their best album or their most essential i would go in this order 1 wish you were here 2 dark side of the moon 3 a saucerful of secrets 4 the wall and after that is up to you but be warned once pulled into the world of pink floyd its hard to get out my collection now consists of over 100 cds bootlegs live and studio and i am still looking for more no question in my mind they are the greatest band ever radiohead u2 listen to floyd and hear the influence whether they admit it or not sure the wall has some teenagerangst but still it is perfect in telling the story of the life of pink dont forget the dvd its great too definite buy|1
if the amazing moody music doesnt drag you in the powerful lyrics will  this album is definately the most powerful and moving ever using strange phsycidellic techniques but never losing its musical integrity|1
this album is just blah reworking a whole commercial reggae thang in no particular intriguing or original waydefinitely nothing underground thats been dug up as any gem this one|0
the beginning of the cd has a very bad sound as if there was an error in the recording i will never buy another cd from amazon without an explanation i have the time out album and a cd of time out and they are perfect renditionsi did love the dvd of dave brubeck explaining how he came up with the tunes|0
i wanted to complete my collection of beatles albums and i was told no collection was complete without the white album  i was dissappointed sounded like the beatles were doing heavy drugs at the time of the release of this album with the exception of a few known hits the rest of the album is a waste  i wish i could return it for the best of the moody blues  rb|0
henry mancini gave us so much of our consciousness of the 1960s and 1970s and yet was out almost as soon as he was inhis work became synonymous with muchdespised elevator music in the later 1960s this stereotype or monotype for his earliest works can misleadfor example lujon not in this collection was used in a movie just last year to exemplify mystery and an exotic atmospheremancini died way too young while some would argue that hed become a selfparody his innate gifts compromised by relentless commercialization you cannot take away his lasting gift to our culture he was an original and he captured an essence of our collective experiencehes here in this collection waiting round the bend could be my huckleberry friend  however what youll get are elevator arrangements of standard country tunes  the heart and soul are just not there im afraid  save your money|0
great cd  great comedian  give brian until about the third track and youll belaughing nonstop from there on  the great thing about brian is that his jokes areclean and his language is extremely mild however he does use hell several timesthis is a must hear|1
the albums ok but it wouldve been better as a 4song ep that said the songs are great my favorites are the harrison tunes only a northern song and its all too much all together now and hey bulldog are ok for the completist|0
pink floyd has always been a favorite artist of mine the wall is one of their greatest albums ever hello to all you pink floyd fans and to all you people who might get into pinks floyds music do it  youll be glad you did|1
not what i was expecting very disappointed with the music on this cd  i love chanukah music but not this one|0
this is a quality product which accurately renders the magnificence of the singular pink floyd excellent buy and particularly instructive for the modern musically challenged listener|1
i got this just for i like it like that because i couldnt find the blackout allstars single anywhere  a lot of this release tito sounds like hes trying to be the latin barry white|0
this is a terrific performance of the requiem it is not too modern not too original and very human tempos are reasonable why is this so hard the soloists are lovely and the orchestra plays with just a touch of vibrato just enough expression to give life to the music the fugues are clean and sprightly great musicianshipunfortunately the mp3 download compression is horrid there is a lot of digital distortion  and of course it comes in those spots at the most gorgeous height of a phrase too bad i am sure the cd would be a good purchase but i have no need for the physical materialtruly if there was a way to return a digital download i would i am not able to listen to it without fixating on the compression problems|0
this is not rush as ive expected very frustrating at the end where they seem to add anything to fulfill the album|0
this is a recording of a scratchy lp i should be allowed to return it especially since the samples are not scratchy and therefore misleading|0
this included dvd is in pal or european format and will not play on north american machines contacted chanlee provider and reply was mostly balderdash and presumptious music is good but if you want to see the perdormance this is not the set for north american viewers|0
my children have been fans of rush ever since they were very young having followed them pretty much around the us and puerto ricoi bought clockwork angels as a gift for vadim who is a psychiatrist now  he was thrilledthey will be fans forever|1
this is one of the best hard rock cds ive heard in a very long timefar better than the first discthere is a version with a cddvd package but i bought the cd only and found a serious rocker bonus track not listed on the liner and from what i hear not included if you buy the cddvd packagethe band is very diverse on this with rockers cranking hard rockers and some lighter rockers and ballads hagar is at the top of his game everyone is and standing out individually while creating an open quality band statement on each trackthree and half letters is a very powerful words and music rockin pieceno change the unlisted bonus track just absolutely rocks full tiltive only heard the whole disc twice but in will be my driving disc for a long time i hope the radio catches on to this|1
amazing cd by 3 guys they still sound great after all these yearsi could not be more impressed buy it|1
i love jay perez his song todo lo que yo tengo was the song that started my whole fascination with jay perez i fell in love with his voice and have remained a loyal fan since this albulm came out i love the way this man can pour his soul out while singing a song i can feel what he means and he will forever be my 1 male singer i think the ttmas finally gave him the credit that he was due by winning male vocalist of the year jay perez is not only the voz but he is the king in my heart i love you jay perez|0

this cd is a huge disappointment after hearing kevin and his quartet perform in concert this february i mistakenly assumed that spiritalk 2 1995 would be similar in style i should have known better 11 years is too much of a gap the drummer marvin smitty smith sounds like an immature teenager who wants to assuage his ego by dominating the band kevins music is very sensitive and beautiful underneath smittys maniacal and repetitious rock pounding i now see why the cd cost only 377 usedso i really shouldnt complain i got what i paid forhowever the concert in 2006 was awe inspiringi sat transfixed smitty played magnificently he integrated his drumming beautifully with the other sidemen bill piercesax carlito delpuertobass and drove the band fiercely without overwhelming the musicnot at all like this cdtoday the offensive rock pounding of 1995 is gone and smittys touch has gained maturity too bad i cannot say that for this cd dont buy it unless you perfer overwhelming loud and tasteless rock drumming|0
there are so many better kids artists raffi is so cheesy and boring i dont know who is worse raffi or barney|0
george carlin is one of the most clever comedians of out time but he really starts to lose it in the 90s and back in town is a good example of how hes replaced clever insightfulness with bad language  with the exception of the track abortion the album lacks wit displayed in his other classic routines like class clown|0
pink floyds masterpiece  the wall is one of the greatest albums i keep coming back to i was introduced to the wall when i was 15 years old the album has left a strong impression on me the wall carried me through my teenage times it has an awesome power which overshadowed creations of other artists for me the wall has a special connotation for me  a person coming from the exsoviet country the music background noise and lyrics may seem somewhat scattered around but this is where its power the wall is reflective image of the emotions and feelings of a person who faces cruel realities of life  the wall will ever stay in the top notch of the pink floyds creations for its dedicated fans|1
i would review it if i got it come on guys i placed the order on 1606|0
slash delivers a consistently hardrocking solo album thats far better than his first  anastasia may be slashs best song since his gnr days with an incredible opening riff driving groove and excellent solos  and slash shows that he can deliver driving riffs on standouts shots fired apocalyptic love and lead single youre a lie  sharp driving and deadly  go ahead and try not to bang your head to the machinegun rhythm  chorus of  shots fired out of range they wanna see me in a bloodsoaked grave but still i live to die another dayalthough sometimes myles kennedy sometimes struggles to keep up eg one last thrill halo he delivers a soulful performance on the excellent ballad not for me where his strong vocal presence propels slash to one of the better solos on the album  and is topped off by a callandresponse vocalguitar ending  similarly no more heroes is fueled by an amazing slash guitar tone and strong chorus that suggest that this could be the beginning of bigger things for slash  myles  overall great stuff|1
for some reason my review got deleted from the site so heres a new onei have always loved this cd despite the fact that it doesnt flow extremely well and that waters dominated the group way too much  it is one of the most recognizable pink floyd achievements and rightly so  there seem to be a lot of kids bashing this album so i will say it right now  hey guys stop using the childrens review section and just create your own account  or better yet leave the sitethere are good intermixings of hits on both cds with songs like comfortably numb and the like  it is a very strange album though not nearly as strange by itself as it is in conjunction of the movie with the same name  i know that some floyd fans tire of this cd after awhile but after dark side of the moon the first cd you should get for this band the wall is their second best albumif you dont like pink floyd this cd wont change your mind  i suggest you listen to animals first and if you like that cd get this one the wall is expensive and its a waste of money if you dont enjoy it|1
the wall is plain and simple one of pink floyds best albums and is easily along with atom heart mother and dark side of the moon my favorite floyd album the only other floyd one i have is their totally insane album ummagumma that though it does have an awesome live disc and has some decent moments on their experimental studio disc for the most part just isnt all its cracked up to be but the wall thankfully is nothing like that one every song is just unique with some notable highlights being the another brick trio young lust one of my turns comfortable numb and in the flesh but really this is the only album that ive ever listened to that definitely deserves to be listened to all the way through with no breaks in between and each and every song relies on each other to make this the most cohesive album ive ever heard i cant even imagine listening to certain songs by themselves out of the context of the album in my opinion one should only hear pink floyds the wall in its entirety or not at all this is just a really awesome album that i believe everyone should own the wall all the way|1
dame joan simply doesnt get it there is no drama in her interpretation of this complex role she conveys nothing her husbands conducting is bad as well i am so disappointed by this recordingher pronounciation is bad phrasing as well qual cor tradisti is unbearablewhoever wants to hear real norma get callas studio recording or live from la scala those are ultimate normas|0
ive been a rush fan since 2112  these guys are the greatest band ever  theyve had their slumps but clockwork angels is an amazing album  i use the word album in a totally digital world of pick and choose the collection of songs sets a mood and tells a story start to finish  it is understated greatness  the rock  roll hall of fame can suck it for snubbing this band for so long|1
brian regan has to be the funniest comic i have ever seen the laughsperminute ratio is so intensely high you should make sure not to be drinking anything while listening to this album|1
our whole family loves raffi  my husband and i love listening to him as much as our one year old son does  our son sways dances and bounces to his music often pointing to his cd each morning so that we can put him on  his music is positive warm hearted and comforting  he puts all of us in such good spirits  and nothing soothes our son like raffiwe highly recommend this collection|1
erase all hope of remaining sane strange and oddly compelling soundtrack|0
pink floyds epic album is definitely one of the greatest music masterpieces of all time while diehard floyd fans may say that dark side of the moon was infinitely better the wall disturbingly beautiful is still an undisputed classic the story it tells while easier to understand upon viewing the movie is still here in all its dark glory following a rock star through his battered mind and eventual breakdown from start to finish its a nightmare dressed like a fantasy easy listening that requires multiple close inspections and thats just how it sounds on the surfacethe opening track in the flesh sets the stage for the rest of the album the wistful guitar riff builds a sense of longing in the listener and lyrics like if you wanna find out whats behind these cold eyes youll just have to claw your way through this disguise practically force you to keep going once youre inside though youll wish you hadnt come songs like the thin ice and another brick in the wall  part 1 see to that quickly replacing the yearning cries of in the flesh with darker more foreboding lyrics and sudden changes into keys normally reserved for funeral processions even in its happier sounding moments the words and music still keep pulling you down when tied in with the rest of it for example soft acoustic melodies like mother sound nice and peaceful giving a respite from the anguish that came before until you start paying attention to lyrics like mommas gonna put all her fears into you even singer roger waters voice sounds as though he is on the verge of tears throughout the song making it painful yet irresistible and its not just the music that hurts in between some songs are bits of dialogue from the movie to help put everything in perspective for example goodbye blue sky begins with a small child exclaiming look mommy theres an airplane in the sky when coupled with the songs title and the opening line did you see the frightened ones did you hear the falling bombs the childs innocence and implied loss thereof wrenches as much pity as possible out of the listener its not all sorrow though knowing that making the album 100 depressing all the way through would probably lead to more cases like the one being sung about the band managed to fit in a couple tracks like young lust and run like hell to give listeners a bit of a break of course even these relatively upbeat songs are not completely free of the darkness overrunning this album run like hell with its bright guitardriven melody still contains lyrics like if we catch you in the backseat trying to pick her lock well send you back to mother in a cardboard box guaranteed to produce more than a slight shudder and the climax of the whole album the trial is easily enough to drive anyone mad if for whatever insane reason you havent heard it yet i wont ruin the details for you but i suggest you hurry up and take a listenthe album is also relatively unique in that it contains a number of lyrical symbols and motifs the most obvious of these is of course the wall which the star of the album builds up around his psyche to protect himself from the outside world the wall plays a vast role in his life and is mentioned in at least half the songs on this album it is present from the beginning to the end and is the focal point of all the nightmares the star suffers another frequently appearing symbol is the worm which represents everything about the world from which the star is trying to hide it is a symbol of terror always around the corner ready to make life miserable this is most evident in the line and the worms ate into his brain from the song hey you as well as in the trial in which the worm takes on the role of the sadistic judge this is much easier to see in the movie when the worm itself can be seen more easilyoverall the wall is an album seldom paralleled in its sheer ability to possess its listeners even while twisting the world about them until they can share the nightmare of the albums star pink floyd mix their stunning lyrical ability and beautiful instrumental arrangements to create a dark fantasy from which none can truly escape not that they would ever want to|1
i just cant imagine why the company released this in hifi monophonic the first early beatle cds are all in that format what a waste at least they could have released the cd in real monophonic mono songs like and i love her without the overdub would sound much better in the original mono like the united artist version of this album also if i fell without pauls voice break in the last verse would sound much better all in all a stereo version of this cd would be satisfying not this junk|0
added note bruckner lovers  navigate to hear the chamber ensemble version done by the linos ensemble  praise to the algorithm for suggesting itthere is an error  a bruckner 7 with francophonie canadian is merged with this version the thomas christian ensemble  somebody named christian leads that  i am being approximate because one cannot look at the actual page and write the review at the same time so who can rememberi thought maybe there was an error and that the wrong bruckner 7 was hitched to these links  this is no chamber ensemble to my ears although very pretty  but the same sounds are at itunes as here and the slow movement is by far the slowest or longest on record  and i have almost every record  the timing is 24 minutes  many are 18  maybe this is the only performance that takes every repeat  but the pace sounds very slow|0
we saw brian regan live and the room was filled with ages 10110 he is so funny without being crude which is a big feat these days i wish it had been an hour longer or more kudos brian his brother is funny as well|1
as a longtime rush fan its difficult for me to review this album without heaping adulation on geddy alex and neil all the same ill do my best to avoid gushing i have been listening to clockwork angels just about every day since i got it and i am really really impressed the guys have proven themselves truly progressive in the sense that they continue to push their sound forward adding new elements to their songwriting repertory without abandoning the chops and complexity that make them great the end result is that rush have managed to put together a steampunkbased concept album that not only rocks hard but also feels incredibly vibrant unpretentious and downtoearth well done lads|1
upon reading a lot of negativity i was skeptical because we have to be negative first this is what gets the pot stirring  aside from having 456 of the beatles various pressings i a beatles lifer couldnt resist the temptation to losedrop  on four lps so far abbey road magical mystery tour peppers and  the white album mmt is super on my shure v15iii loud clear vibrant etc abbey road played as back round was ok later played under louder conditions the background noise almost drowned out the music  no fuzz on the needle two cleanings later and this record sounds as if it has been played 4000 timesare they serious no this is not just my copy you can see for yourself im afraid to open the other two|0
some may consider dark side of the moon the best pink floyd album ever  i feel however that the wall is superior  it provides an elaborate social commentary on the failings of modern society and how this affects us all  while the content of the album is vast there is a consistent flow to it  a story is being told and the album must be studied at length to trully  appreciate all of the hidden symbolism  there is a connection between all  of the songs and listening to them in sequence is highly recommended  there are however several songs which are also selfcontained  masterpieces  for example another brick in the wallpart 2 mother hey  you comfortably numb and run like hell are all hits in their own right  another great aspect of the album is that it is one of pink floyds most  sonically dense works  a high definition sound system is  highly recommended when listening to this album  the lyrics themselves  are very good and elaborate  this is roger waters at his poetic best  overall i feel that this is floyds best album|1
wonderful songs for learning and discovering life multicultural enrichment and good for free movement and creativity  great for group activities and learning about music and its elements|1
this is an incredible record  slash is at the top of his game  obviously he has found the right chemistry to produce what i believe is the best rock record in a long time  myles kennedy is fantastic  i love alter bridge but i think myles has found a greater and more creative collaboration here every track is fantastic but if i have to pick a favorite it would be 8 anastasia this track is pure gnr nostalgia  myles is a much better singer than axl rose could ever hope to be this seriously feels like it could be a gnr record buy this record it rocks|1
one of the most brilliant albums of all time the wall reenforces the far more guitar driven floyd of animals  as with most double albums the first disc is much heavier and contains brilliant songs like in the flesh the another brick in the wall trilogy young lust and dont leave me now  it does not outshine the second disc however which contains brilliant ballads such as hey you is there anybody out there comfortably numb and run like hell  this was the last pink floyd album in which roger waters and david gilmour were partners in crime and its an amazing listen  the wall is a little over eighty minutes of the lateseventiesearlyeighties progressive rock pink floyd is known for  this is no dark side of the moon or wish you were here  this is the hard rock album that would most likely influence not only the progressive alterntive rock movements of the nineties smashing pumpkins radiohead but the gothic industrial movement as well nine inch nails marilyn manson|1
we liked the one of the digital generation better a lady at church played the one y the digital generation and we liked it better|0
did not enjoy this cd  i was looking for a particular song but it was not on the cd and i did not enjoy any of the others|0
pink floyd the wall is excellent album it is one of my favorite albums of all time the wall is my favorite cause it is good musically and lyrically it isnt like other concept albums that the music is good but the lyrics are bad i got into pink floyd when echoes came out i bought that and then i got the wall the problem i had with the wall is how does it end  from watching the movie and listening to the album i think he goes insane i also liked the movie i bought out what the album is which is unique im just glad the movie wasnt done like the sgt pepper movie|1
i realize it may seem hypocritial of me to criticize the guy who gave  revolver one star on top of all the five star ratings and then bash this  but what i say here is my genuine opinion this is far and away the  beatles worst album  there just isnt much good i can say about itnone  of the songs are memorable  i listened to this three or four times when i  first bought it some five years ago and i havent since  only a  necessary purchase for beatles completists|0
sadly enough the beatles were never as good as the rolling stones they just never reached their heights in excellencethe majority of the songs recorded by the beatles were silly and childesh the beatles are one of the  most overrated bands in history their finished albums are not even very  good so how could their bloopers be any better this is a dull album from  one of the worst bands in all history|0
let it be is an amalgamation of choppy incoherent pieces that just dont add up the material on this album sounds like it came from the editing room floor at abbey road studios and thats where it shouldve stayedon the brighter side the singles versions of the long and winding road let it be and get back are far better than those on the album as an aside to this day ill never understand why they let the album version of get back end with ringo saying on behalf of the group i hope we all passed the audition sorry im missing something here anyway beatles fans would do well to skip this album and get their 19671970 complilation album that included these and other great songs of that eragiven the overall weakness of let it be i think the beatles shouldve called it let it alone fans take note|0
guitar world named rush and van halen the top 2 albums of 2012 and its well deserved as much as i hate lists this one i agreethis is pure rush it reminds me of classic rush its like nothing has changed its a reminder of why we love rush in the first placerush has continued to make great music after so many years with the same lineup thats not easy for any bandi wont go into why this album is great as so many other reviewers have mentioned alreadyjust listen for yourself|1
thanks love this imported version from argentina thank you excellent album by the worlds bestest band rush at their finest|1
there very first song was a hit and loved it very much but have went downhill since thenthe buckaru|0
i must have overlooked that it was a cassette tape no one listens to cassette tapes anymore a waste of my money|0
its amazing that pink floyd has come out with two amazing groundbreaking albums dark side of the moon and the walldark side of the moon spent over 10 years on the billboard charts the wall is their next greatest effort with outstanding songs such as the happiest days of our livesanother brick in the wall part 2 empty spacesyoung lust hey you and comfortably numb each one of these songs defines the many sounds of pink floyd there is hard rock progressive rock and some music that defies genres most of the last group is really weird music which some people swear has a deeper meaning but really floyd was just high when they wrote the songs even if you own the original record or tape you must get the cd because all of the great songs are so much more amazing as digitally remastered which includes better sound quality and the instruments and singing sound better and clearer buy this album just to here the song comfortably numb because it is that good|1
is this an april fools joke played a few months after the factan album with nothing but single piano chords|0
cocaine annie is a collection of fairly standard blues riffs with not a lot of very original things done with them  a song will start out with a nice beginning but it will never go anywhere with that and by the end the listener is left feeling that a lot of potential was wasted  most of the solos felt rushed as if the guitarist was just filling in time until the vocals began again instead of trying to make interesting music  perhaps its a good thing that the album doesnt try to reach very high because when it does try to leave the cozy and safe blues clicheacutes it ends up falling flat on its face  for example the song where coleman is wailing about wanting to be your personal manager just doesnt work  the modern sentiment expressed not to mention the inherent silliness of comparing a lover to being someones personal manager is very much at odds with the rest of the album which is pretty much straight classic blueson the other hand there are some good moments that stand out  there are one or two guitar solos that made me sit up and wish that hed put as much effort into the rest of the album as he did into those  some of the vocals are quite good and convey a real sense of meaning behind them however when they are mixed with some of the lesser thoughtout lyrics like the aforementioned personal manager the result is to drag down the rest of the album in its own silliness  ultimately this album is a very mixed bag with not a lot of originality or creativity going into its making  it makes for fairly decent background music but it doesnt stand up well to careful scrutiny|0
being a big fan of anthonys i found this album to be overly self expressive and perhaps a bit self indulgent the reason anthony is so brilliant is because he has the ability to produce some truly powerful  stuff when he wants to though his acoustic prowess is virtually unmatched  its his rock heavy stuff that really gives you a sense of how great he is  this album is almost like listening to steve hacketts bay of kings which  has some beautiful guitar work but starts to sound redundant due to the  lack of variety|0
in the same vein as leprachaun in the hood this hellraiser tries to ensare viewers with a whole new batch of club cenobites  the lady with the slit throat is replaced by a rave girl with a traecheotomy the dj spits killer cds out of his head a trick that was done better in dolph lundgrens i come in peace and theres some jerk with a video camera in his headi had hoped that hell on earth would take some risks possibly show pinhead and his crew doing their thing on crowded city streets and pick up on the seeds they planted in the second edition for continuity  how pinhead got from being executed by the doctor cenobite at the end of two to that stupid piece of modern art is beyond meinstead of paving any new ground this movie strips the franchise of its noir  pinheads just another wishmaster or freddy  the contemporary cenobites are less frightening than corey feldman on an ether binge  the story is stiff and disappointing barely connecting itself with the rest of the series proving that gore does not a horror movie make  even worse the makeup and effects look rubbery  that they dropped the mysterious hoboteredactyl guy from the ensemble entirely was salt in the woundthe sequel to this film bloodlines is pretty much the same caliber dooming further and better installments like inferno and hellseeker to direct to video releases  do yourself a favor and pretend they never happened|0
i was not informed that this title has a narration in english intercalated with the music although i understeood almost everything my family did not and my translation disrupted the listening  pity|0
i listen to it at work at the gym in the truck around the house everyday since its release it is complete wholesome rock n roll from beginning to end with every song leading me to the repeat button i find it hard to make it through the whole album before getting interrupted and this can be upsetting at timesid write a lengthy review but plain and simply put  if you are thinking about it stop thinking and buy it you will not regret it|1
these cds have soothed many a fussy child and i find myself reliving my childhood through them  a must have|1
most reviewers have already put it very well clockwork angels is a classic rush album  certainly in their top 3 or 4 remarkably this release manages to capture the adrenalin of their peak efforts over the decades  the music is dynamic and complex while the production is muscular and modernlyrically the album is an expansion of the steampunk motif that mr peart has been exploring for a couple of years the clockwork universe metaphor is used to explore themes of individuality loneliness existence and love which in turn reflect a bleeding heart libertarian worldview mr pearts self description the upcoming companion novel of the same name by kevin anderson should be a great treat for fans of science fiction or rushas the bands cultural stock has risen in recent years much has been said or written about the glaring omission of rush from the rock and roll hall of fame sadly politics literally has much more to do with this omission than most people realizemr peart although he has consistently said he is no ones blind follower initially raised the ire of some reviewers by acknowledging the widely read libertarian writer ayn rand in the liner notes to rushs fourth album 2112  mr peart is also known for not following the politically correct rock starcelebrity model eg avoiding hollywood fundraisers for the dnc and generally eschewing the modern publicists rules of the gamejann wenner rolling stones founder and well known fundraiser for the democratic party is of course an ardent leftist progressive  he is also a huge player in the machinery of the modern celebrity  ayn rand although reviled by many on the right for her libertarian social views and position in opposition to organized religion is also criticized from the left for her focus on individualism and free market principles she was in fact against collectivism and redistributionism which places her in direct opposition to a large segment of the current democratic partyalthough ms rand was a jewish immigrant antifascist antitotalitarian and very libertarian regarding individual freedoms she  and by association the band  were demonized by the professional left for being insufficiently politically correctsome 2112 reviewers in both england and the us initiated attacks against rush which went so far as to refer to the band as somehow fascist  the incredible irony of the attacks willfully ignored geddy lees and alex lifesons family histories in nazi and eastern european prison camps as well as rands own terrible childhood under the maelstrom of russian totalitarianism  nonetheless there began a libelous assault against the bandthe bands understandable reaction was to avoid the press altogetherfortunately as original rush fans have gotten older and attained positions of leadership and influence there has also developed a new generation of rush fans who ignore the politically correct attacks and simply discover the band on their own terms rush today is flourishing and succeeding beyond the wildest expectation of even their most ardent original fansrolling stone unable to ignore either the massive growing popularity of the band over multiple decades or the overwhelming praise from the non political music press has very noticeably begun to give the band more favorable notices  although some in the traditional rock press continue to give the band backhanded compliments most reviewers today praise the band as virtuoso iconic or legendaryfurthermore while jann wenner and the rock and roll hall of fame have become somewhat anachronistic rush keep touring writing and playing by their own rules all the while appealing to aspiring musicians and free thinkers over multiple generations|1
it had been a while since the legendary venezuelan rock band sentimiento muerto had been dissolved when the bands former frontman pablo dagnino decided to go solo expectations were high considering the outstanding work the band did and the longstanding fan base they developed but biorritmos was not up to the challenge the resulting album was a bland pop production that didnt sound any different from the other artists that were topping the venezuelan charts at the time pedro castillo who played guitars in the album being one of the most famous ones as a result this album went mostly unnoticed and became an effort that most hardcore venezuelan rock fans became dissapointed withdagnino later went on to form the band pixel with former members of other famous venezuelan bands theyve recorded two albums to this day none of which ive had a chance to listen to i can just recommend you to skip this solo mistake|0

i love this album and play it every christmas  this music is especially nice for people who have a very religious feeling of the birth of christ in this season  as a christian person i really relayed to this music  took me back to singing the hymns in choir as a child|1
i heard the song im so sick on mtv2 well at least watched the video for it and quite frankly afterward i felt angry for i dont know what reason so i turned on the computer and hit ares and started to download their album i thought the rest of the album would have been better lyrically at least but no it all sounds like a whinney 13 year old girl though out the album complaing this albums lyrics remind me more of the grunge era but with an expection of it being more drug inducedi was looking up for info about this band and they are a christian band which is laughable if you ever heard the lyrics to im so sick or any song on this album its hardly christian and like i cant believe this band got put on mtvthe video for im so sick reminds me of an nin video thrown together with a korn video and a lingering of tool in therebut then again i shouldnt really compare bands who have been around longer to this band cause i dont really see a long lasting career for this band they are just too generic and nu metal for methis band kinda did pick the wrong time to come out if they were out in 9900 they would have been around for a few albums but i dont see much of a career in themthere are female metal singers who can outwrite and outsing lacey who isnt that great of a singer in the first place|0
i cant stop listening to this cd  i cant stop singing the songs  this is much better than my expectations the packaging is awesome if you are considering buying this get the cd instead of mp3 download because it is worth it i spent an hour messing with the booklet and 3d glasses a must for true rock fans|1
obviously rubber soul is an extremely good album  unfortunately this 2009 remastering is not  the remastering took all of the soul out of it  this is not even close to the original lp in terms of sound quality  a lot of the sound that was there on vinyl is absent as if they took an eight track recording and cut it to two tracks  a disappointment|0
seal is one of my favorite artists so i was thrilled to have an opportunity to hear anything he might have to say outside of the realm of song ltggt  this interview was conducted shortly before seals  second release seal 2i was not disappointed to hear seal express  opinions that were in line with who i imagined him to be based solely on  his music up to that point  i was disappointed by the recording  quality theres lots of background noise of other people blabbing etc  here and there throughout the recoding and the sorry lame questions  asked by the interviewer  i suspect he probably listened to seals first  cd but he didnt ask anything more than typical surface level  interview questions  certainly not some of the things a fan  would really like to know about some of the songs from the first and  second albumsseal is still the tops and i look forward to finding an  interview disc where the interviewer is both interesting and informed  if  youre a diehard fan then you may enjoy this alternative look at an  incredibly talented artist seal  im at least glad that i had an  opportunity to hear it|0
if you really really want a good laugh look no further than brian regan  not only does he poke fun of every one of us by poking fun at himself he does it in a way that makes us glad to be humans on his planet  brian uses everyday occurances as the basis for the most hilarious bits and does it without taking you to places you wouldnt want your parents to see you  he manages to bring you to your knees in hysterical laughter without once bringing sex profanity or raunchy behavior into his act  it might not sound cool to most people but brian regan is without a doubt the only comic on the circuit that the whole family can enjoy and enjoy you will  i got the chance to see brian at a comedy club in dallas back in 96 so funny the first night i bought tickets for the remaning nights of his engagement  and hes a genuinely nice guy too  and it shows through brilliantly in his perfectly hilarious act  buy this|1
this side up is a great mix of tuneful ballads and uptempo cuts all beautifully played and recorded  eric marienthals soulful sax on a number of tracks compliments the grooves and melodies laid down by jones bridger and friends  and if you are also a fan of traditional jazz standards check out this duos website  for more wonderful recordings|1
la primera vez que tuve la desgracia de escuchar este cd fue en casa de una familia colombiana en sarasota  en esa epoca yo era el manager de un conjunto musical llamado voces libres  el cuarteto fue contratado para tocar una serenata la noche del cumpleantildeos de la sentildeora de la casa y despues que los muchachos terminaron con su toque fuimos invitados a quedarnos para la rumba  eventualmente le llego el turno a esta pocilga musical cuando el duentildeo de casa estaba tocando musica pregrabada  las voces de los integrantes del trio vino blanco sugieren que el trio deberia haber sido llamado conjunto cloaca porque realmente son horripilentas  los arreglos son malisimos  da laacutestima porque todo lo demas que sale de colombia dentro del aacutembito musical es muy pero muy superior  vino blanco no le llega ni a los tobillos a otros trios colombianos como el trio martino por ejemplo  iexclhe dicho en mi humilde opinion|0
hands down rushs best release in yearsalex has some really short but tasty guitar solos i dont have much else to say cause im not a bigtime music reviewer but clockwork angels has rush back on top of their game|1
watch out theres music  i personally dont mind music in the background of nature cds but this music sounds kind of fake or synthetic almost like the instruments were all played on an elecric piano  you could probably pick out a more enjoyable cd|0
this was the first recording of les mis i ever heard and i thought it was gorgeous at first now having listened to all the official englishlanguage casts and several of the foreign language ones this ones  pretty yucky david byrants marius pales dreadfully next to that of  michael balls rendition as do randy graff and terrance manns  performances the thernardiers were simply unfunny and colm wilkinson and  frances ruffelle sound the same as they do on the london cast the only  reason i really listen to this at all anymore is to hear judy kuhns  delightful cosette get the london version or if youre willing to shell  out a few extra bucks buy the complete recording both are ten times  better than this one|0
i dont see why anyone wouldnt like this album sure it has some bad songs bring the boys back home the trial but it still deserves 5 stars|1
pink floyd has never made a bad album as long as roger waters was with them|1
flyleaf is an amzing new group with a style sort of like evanescancebut even better than them they have an amazing new style and the lead singers voice is amazing the fresh beat and rythem is invograting i love this band|1
take a minute to think about rush out of context they are a trio of old farts that have been peddling largely the same inaccessible progressive rockmetal sound for thirtyeightplus years now so does that make them a band that is fresh out of ideas absolutely not  you should have known better than to think that somehow even with band members that are well into their sixties they still manage to sound fresh and innovative and their instrumental prowess still manages to blow minds even if it isnt quite as godly as it was when they recorded say 2112 all the way back in the midseventies add to this exceptional musicianship a batch of drummer neil pearts most imaginative and inventive lyricism his lyrics usually adopt a concerted scifi feel and the end result is clockwork angels the nineteenth  studio album of the bands influential career and quite possibly their best effort since 1981s moving pictureslead single caravan elegantly pins a catchy bobbing guitar hook against a bed of deft technical warbling bass lines and soaring melodic vocals it also makes room for one especially memorable chorus too but if this song is very good then the next track bu2b is positively great it is a huge highlight on account of it being easily clockworks heaviest song and also one of the heaviest tunes of rushs whole career it has a weird proggy intro sure but it then storms back with massive thunderously pounding and actually quite crushing riffs and funky slapped bass lines the next handful of tracks however find the bands rhythm section taking over with the title cut and carnies a raucous romp adopting an almost motorheadworthy punkderived bass tone that drives the song forward with more really clever fills and riffs but only the former of these two cuts is also highlighted by some more excellent melodic vocals tasty harmonic guitar solo work and a really proggy unplugged guitarbreak where the acoustic guitars are heard noodling away endlessly and the anarchist is also highlighted by a particularly noteworthy rhythm section with a bouncy propulsive drum intro that flows into muscular bassdriven territoryfrontman geddy lees exceptional bass work also comes into the spotlight on some later tracks take for example seven cities of gold because it marries an excellent bass solo in its intro with memorable electric guitar riffs a crashing drum beat and memorable vocal patterns some strong jazzy stopstart bass lines coarse throughout it too elsewhere halo effect a proggy acoustic ballad and a fairly brief and compact one at that as it clocks in at just over the three minute mark the wreckers which features some more colorful acoustic strumming heavy bass lines and a really big and memorable singsongy chorus and bu2b2 an 87second long interludetype track that finds what sounds like a violin accompanying geddys clean soulful singing are a few other standouts but it is headlong flight that takes the cake for being the sets pinnacle it is a surprisingly uptempo and hardrocking nearly sevenandahalfminute long epic piece that is highlighted by an excellent and really deft foursecond long drum solofill from neil and a totally airguitarworthy shredding solo from alexchallenging both for the band and the listener lengthy its total playing time is 66 minutes brilliantlywritten it almost never adheres to standard versechorusverse structuring and impeccably performed clockwork angels embodies pretty much everything that progressive music is all about therefore this album just might be the best prog rockmetal release of the year 2012 and it certainly is one heckuva way for a band to begin their fifth decade of existence indeed if this isnt the sound of a band that is aging gracefully then i dont know what it is|1
when this album first came out it made me lose interest in pink floydthe individual songs are great but what reasonably sane adult can listen to it all the way through more than once or twicei was thirteen years old and tripping on liquid acid the first time i heard this album in late 1979normally in that condition i would get totally absorbed in previuos floyd releases but this one bored me during several sections even upon first listenbuy the cd at a discount price and if you are like me you will want to burn a single disc worth of songsif they had originally released this as a single album comprised of only the best songs it would have been a masterpieceinstead it is only a good album that can get tedious at times|1
this cd highlights some of the best songs and sounds from veracruz  many of these songs have been around for more than a century  these songs portray the soul and spirit of the people and the instruments from that region  listen to a version of la bamba and other classics in their most original form  if anyone has ever been interested in knowing more about the diversity of mexican folk music this is your opportunity|1
pink floyds the wall is a really great album with unique songs like comfortably numb another brick in the wall part 2 or one of my favourite floyd songs hey you but i miss somethig from the most of this album this is david gilmour to make you understand what i mean as everyone knows most of the album was written by roger waters but just take a look at some other songs like shine on you crazy diamond echoes or time  they all were written by the four members in fact by gilmour and waters in 99 these two or four as you like men could work very well together and wrote a lot of great albums waters  almost alone  could not write such a great album gilmour could just listen to to the division bell and dont forget this album led to waters secession of the bandbut to say good things too it can not be misunderstood what the album wants to tell the world it tells what violence and dictatorsip can lead to how can it destroy peoples thoughts minds lives it can be felt the most when you listen to comfortably numb  but this can be seen in your minds eye all the time you listen to this album because this  like the bands other albums  can not be and must not be divided into separate parts  including even the two sides of the vinyl or cassete|1
good way of learning lakota slowly in your own way not pressured and hearing the way it is spoken nice to have a way to learn our language|1
these songs are funny poetic entertaining exciting singable evenfor the very yong ones my children grew up with them and so do my grandkids now|1
i must say that i am very disappointed with this cd its bad enough that only select movements from symphonies concertos sonatas etc are put on compilation albums like this one but it irritates me to no end that even  the individual movements themselves are cut  supposedly edited for  leisure listening this cd in no way fulfilled my expectations of  what it would be most tracks are about 3 minutes long whereas they should  actually be anywhere from 515 minutesbut aside from this content  problem the quality of the tracks is not that good either the sound has a  dull flat quality to it and is not as rich or lively as other recordings  ive heard of the same pieces and in case this means anything to you  there is a note on the cd case that states digitally mastered from  the original analog tapes whether this is good or not the cd does  not sound as great as it seems to claimalso on a more irrelevant  note if you are expecting this cd to contain 25 of the most widelyknown  familiar pieces then dont buy it because not many of them are  popularmy advice would be to find another compilation even if that  means buying one with less tracks that contains the full versions of the  movements and that sounds much better than this one|0
i am a huge pink floyd fan pink floyd is my favorite band of all time and this ablbum is the best they had ever done  the wall is my personal favorite for the most awesome group ever to grace the stage|1
happy to have the audio along with the book to use in our homeschool class we are happy to have found the lakota language consortium|1
sammy you are one loose bird to think that this rocks and its the best band you ever played in as you said im not buying what your selling my friend it just doesnt sound together or humble and the words blow too|0
the wall offers such a classic sound to it it is impossable to matchthis album has to be one of the best albums ever between the stunning guitar solos and lyrics that you will never get tired of hearing|1
one star beacuse there are no tracks one does not have the time to listen to a whole act or is willing to when using a cd so this cd becomes one of those forgotten on the shelf what a pity|0
not much in the way of humor on this one easter eggs and orange drinkwhich was stolen from bobcat goldthwait of all peoplebeing the lone exceptions  if you like george carlins angry period where he rails against everything without being funny youll like this  if youre looking for laughs spend your money elsewhere|0
great production compared to the first recordsongwriting is much bettervery good rock albumlistened to this 5 times all the way throughsammy rocks|1
this is like somebody recorded a cassette that recorded an alblum then transferred it to cd its terrible quality dont buy it youll play it once and then itll collect dust terrible sound quality|0

brian regan is the funniest comic i have ever seen live including bill cosby jerry seinfeld ray romano and don ricklesif you have ever wondered what it would be like to walk into a crowd of people tell jokes  you know and bring each and every person to their knees you are  fantasizing about being brian regani have seen him live seven times  that is counting the last two times he has been in atlanta when i bought  two nights tickets per engagement  yes two friends and i watched him two  nights in a row and he never disappoints  listen to some samples on  amazon  then imagine this genius of a man playing the crowd with these  lines nonstop for an hour  if you do that you are beginning to imagine  what its like to see his showno one did not laugh at this man  i  will continue to see him live until i choke on my own gallbladder laughing  at him  and he is completely clean  pure geniuscapturing him on cd  is long overdue and almost by definition incomplete  you will laugh your  ss off at this cd but that is almost nothing compared to seeing him live  buy this cd and call your local comedy club to see when you can lose  bladder control|1
owning almost every album rush has ever released it was only natural that i would purchase this new release clockwork angles however i have to admit that for the first time i was not happy with their last album snakes and arrows so the decision to purchase this one was not automatic with all that said i am happy i did purchase this fast paced hard hitting rocking albumi cant believe these guys are nearing 60 years old neil peart is a drumming machine every space is filled with his presence alex gives amazing guitar riffs and solos one after another and geddy surprises us at the end with some very moving piano in the garden it was this last song that actually made me have to get this albumof course i now love all the tracks which is great since i really only liked 3 off the last album im looking forward to seeing them for the 20th time in november here in los angeles get this album you wont regret it if you like hard rock|1
i have been a rush fan forever i have loved most of the stuff they have put out but always have found a few tracks to be duds on every recent release clockwork angels has no duds it is absolutely amazing beginning to end it is the first rush album since signals that i want to hear all of live i love everything thing about this album i even like the muddy mix flashy wiz kid studio production and the cover art this is the album i have been waiting for thank you neil alex and geddy for making this fan a freaking happy one|1
most lavin collections have two or three songs you just have to hear over and over and will never forget and then two or three which just dont quite work more due to execution than to the idea this album doesnt have the highest of her highs or the lowest of her lows it is very steady very pleasant and certainly a musthave if you are already a fan and a great introduction to her work if you are a rookie christine mixes humor and seriousness better than almost anyone else out there and she is one of those rare womens point of view performers who attracts and can hold on to male fans i like all the songs on this one but her most remarkable pieces are scattered on her other studio discs|1
hernandez seeks to take mariachi music in to new fields and pastures but why do it so badly i know this mariachi has put some good stuff out before and can do better the only thing good about this album is the glenn miller popurri but if youve seen sol de mexico live in concert its old news however hernandez plays some good solo jazz trumpet the song that he should have stayed away from was el cuartro god damn they really butchered that son jalisciense silvestre vargas must have been rolling in his grave ruben fuentes must have cringed there are definitely some older albums by sol de mexico one should look at and hear|0
that is what i said to myself many times while watching this mess why was this made what a waste of time and money on this it does not fit into the original thorn birds story when the original miniseries was made if there was not enough time for the whole story there should have been a narration to explain what happened over the 20 year period of time and then continued on to an ending that would have made sense throughout the whole story hopefully i can go back and watch the original and forget the missing years was ever made made no sense they even got rid of bob the brother and then meggie makes mention of two brothers that would have included bob and more inconsistencies on and on a big mess  why would these actors participate in this project they must have used the actress who required the least pay to play meggie she was so not right for that part how embarrassing i have thrown the dvds away have i mentioned this is a total mess it does not even deserve one star|0
i am a very large fan of mr davis and would say that his recordings of some of mozarts other operas cosi die entfuhrung are among the very finest  but in my estimation at least his don giovanni is a complete failure  weak orchestra sketchy cast total lack of any real drama or tension in the direction  i really cant think of any thing about this recording that would merit someone spending any amount of money for it  stick to furtwanglers 1953 recording or better yet any of karajans 1985 is the best but the 1970 and 1987 salzburg festspiele recordings are also quite good|0
this was the first pink floyd album i bought and i had no idea that this album would change my entire outlook on music before this i had only listened to the beatles and a few other bands the wall showed me there was other incredible music out there this album got me into pink floyd 70s rock roger waters and more music in general this album is so emotionally powerful and musically incredible i think it surpasses any other album ever made i would recommend this album to absolutely anyone|1
warning i have two copies of this cd and they both contain an audible glitch during the song set the controls for the heart of the sun which makes me wonder is this a fake cd with emi labels on the cover intended to look official its hard to imagine emi releasing something with such a clear sonic deficiancyfurthermore the recording level of animals is much much lower than that of saucerful of secrets which is a great deal louder it makes you jump out of your seat when one album closes and the second one begins anyone else agree|0
i have enjoyed everything this author has written and am anxiously awaiting the new one that will be available soon im not a professional reviewer just an ordinary person that likes a good story you wont be disappointed|1
theres been plenty thats already been written about this amazing album i dont really see a need to add yet another review but i do want to add my vote that this is indeed the best rush youve heard in yearswell all debate endlessly on which was their last great album  believe it or not i love presto as much as moving pictures and hemispheres  but im just glad rush never hung it up years ago like so many other bands otherwise we wouldnt have this masterpiece i agree with another reviewer that said he didnt know rush still had it in them im blown away this is proof of that these guys are immortalif youre a rush fan you know better than to judge an album on first listen basically if you dont love this album then you simply havent listened to it enough rush is back|1
i loved the first chickenfoot cd  loved it a lot great cd  this one is better  much better  the song structure and lyrical composition are both superior  these are the best most well constructed lyrics hagar has even written  the backing vocals are simply wonderful vh has got to me missing mikey  the rhythem section is way more then solid  this is simply wonderful powerful hard driving rock and roll  if your fan of rock there is not a bad song in this collection front to back every song is great  maybe the worst song is the single bigfoot so if you liked that youll love the rest of the cd  the hidden track untitled is maybe one of the best among the songs in this collection  buy ityou will not be disappointed|1
my married daughter who lives overseas asked me if i could send a raffi cd for my 15 month old granddaughter she wants to share the songs she remembered hearing as a little girl with her own daughterthis collection contains 3 cds of raffis finest and most memorable tunes well of course before shipping it overseas my husband and i had to listen to these songs which had become a part of our memories they were remarkably freshtimeless and so very well recorded the content is outstanding and the technical quality superior the delivery was super fast as well i think we may order another to have at home to listen to ourselves occasionally and of course to have on hand when the next generation comes bythis is certainly a collection of classics which will become a part of your families best memories|1
just picked up the cd 6 days ago and havent stopped listening to it  i loved rush in the 70s and 80s  i loved many of their songs in the 90s and 00s but clockwork angels is something truly special  in my humble opinion its their best yetive read some reviews that state this album is some kind of return to glory  i dont agree  this is something altogether new  just like were observing them through a looking glass on the galapagos islands they have clearly evolvedi spent saturday pressure cleaning but it would be my first couple hours spent with clockwork angels  the first couple of times through the album i envisioned this steampunk world and the kid that longed for and got more  then as happens so many times with rush i started thinking back on my life through the lyrics and themes of the songs  so while my neighbors thought i was working i was running through the nooks and crannies of my life one song at a timecaravan just might make you go back to your own beginning before all of the choices that would bring your lifetime of adventure  bu2b made me think of the belief systems i naturally learned from my parents and how they changed through my life bu2b2  i defy you not to let halo effect send you down some time passages to some girlfriendsboyfriends that you saw through rose colored glasses  youll be surprised about your own seven cities of gold and how all of those places made you who you are  the wreckers reminded me of the times i needed to have my guard up but didnt  the experiences brought wisdom but something was lost too  wish them well hits home with a reminder that i need to keep the past just where it is and be long on mercy with people  wrapping up with the gardenim reminded that i tend it daily and im always planting watering or destroying if im not careful somethinga pedlar approached me and asked what do you lack  i responded musically nothing at all|1
in 3d isnt really worth the money  if youre into weird al get either running with scissors or bad hair day  if you want comdey get ray stevens|0
well lets see i would have given this little gem a 6 if i could have but nevermind that  this double disc album is truly breathtaking and delivers on every level  the story told is simply stunning and i couldnt love it more  i am only 16 but i have come to appreciate all music even the music i do not prefer  but this is the pinnacle of my collection  great for tripping and great to sleep to  i love this cd pink floyd is great and i own teh dvd of the wall and it is amazing work by roger waters and alan parkeri reccomend it also for viewing|1
can it get any better than this  i submit that it cannot  this guy is so hilarious  my husband and i got this cd after cracking up at his stand up on comedy central  brian regan is one of those comedians you love to see in clubs  you leave reciting some of his stuff and begin to laugh with yourself just thinking about it  everything is clean and nonoffensive as someone else said but to be honest i didnt really think about that until reading their review  but its true very much like bill cosby himself  love it  the only downside is with it being a cd you cant see his facial expressions which if you have seen him on tv you know what i mean   i wish there was more of his stuff available|1
i loved raffi when my daughter was young during the 80s  now that her child can appreciate the joy of raffi and his singalongs i get to relearn his collection  raffi is timeless  i especially enjoyed having the booklet with the lyrics that came with this set  great price and service|1
i inadvertently placed heneger alabama in tennessee  please correct that in the review  charlie louvin would not be happy that his home place had been moved to tennessee thanks|1
in the wall pink floyd ask us if we want to know whats behind these cold eyes well just have to claw through the disguise and that is exactly what they set out to do the album could be called the deconstruction of a rock star part autobiographical and part social satire it tells a story of alienation alienation from fans alienation from each other and finally alienation from oneself which is essentially insanity the first side of the album deals with the past experiences of the main character and their contribution to his insanity personal experiences such as growing up without a father due to wwii the humiliation by teachers in school and overprotective parenting are used as points of departure for their connection to larger social concerns like violence and oppression deficient and stifling educational systems and madness  the second part of the album deals mostly with the main characters own ruminations now behind the wall closed off from the world he is lost in his own tormented mind through this the wall sets out to and does so brilliantly depict some of the psychological mechanisms that might be at the root of emotions like hate and fear and could eventually culminate in destruction and violence  the music is phenomenal it represents the full realization of every direction the band was moving in since waters became the primary creative influence as well as a new level of musicianship and ambiance unmathced in earlier albums the wall has been critisized in the past for its somber mood however i find the mood is more adequately described with words like meditative or contemplative it is not however what you would call a feelgood type of album so if that is what youre looking for than try picking up the bay city rollers or something|1
ive been pouring over the reviews of rush albums on amazon there isnt a single studio album that has below a 4 star average there are six 4 12 star albums 2112 a farewell to kings hemispheres permanent waves signals and clockwork angels and one 5 star rated album moving pictures i know reviews dont mean anything but the reviews on amazon agree with my personal preference when it comes to rush the 4 12  5 star rated albums are absolutely my favorites with counterparts being the only exception to the rulei would honestly propose that clockwork angels is the best album since signals to me rush has finally found the perfect balance between what was what is and what can be with clockwork angels the musicianship is at an all time high lee has finally found a balance between his vocal comfort zone and belting it out like he did in the 70s lifeson is given a chance to shine on several tracks providing some well crafted solos peart is as good as ever despite his track being just a bit too quiet and most importantly this album feels like rush let me explain that last point a bitin my opinion test for echo vapor trails and snakes  arrows didnt really have the same flavor as previous rush albums dont get me wrong they are still good albums there were parts that sounded like rush however on a whole the albums were off when compared the previous entries clockwork angels on the other hand has a feel that is much closer to what rush sounded like in the 70s 80s and early 90s i know this point is very qualitative but there has to be at least one rush fan out there that understands what i am talking aboutso whats the only thing this album desperately needs extra care during the mixing process the mixing is good tweaking the equalizer to the exact perfect values can help a bit but could be better put on a decent pair of headphones sit back and relax close your eyes and listen to the camera eye freewill or analog kid and many more songs and you can easily spot the difference im completely inept when it comes to sound quality and even i can tell a difference between the the past and the present when it comes to production value the wreckers and the garden were instantly put into my rush top 20 songs list but they can sound obnoxious when listening at loud volumesrush needs to run with the momentum gained from this album and put more emphasis on production values in order to get an album that is dubbed best album since moving pictures rather than best album since signals|1
there are sadly and oddly not that many compositions for guitar and piano the two most popular instruments are difficult to play together i suppose since the guitar is so much softer in volume than a piano this is one of the few cds ive ever found with duetsthe musicians seem capable enough perhaps its the material or the acoustics but this recording just seems not terribly exciting the compositions  are lackluster i can hardly hear the guitar when the piano plays cant recommend it|0
i was looking forward to the music but was informed that the product was permenantly out of stock oh well|0
i saw slash on an hbo special but i especially like miles kennedy  he is the real reason i purchased this cd|1
this cd hit me like a ton of bricks this chick sings like a banshee|1
this is book is much larger than i expected  the pictures are great and i love the cd  i was hoping more of his own music would be on it however it is still great music|1
i had never had a cd version of pink floyd so when i was asked to play some pink floyd at a recent gathering of friends i was stuck my new preamp didnt have a phono input for my vinyl records so i decided to look for a copy of the wall on amazon the purchase was painless and shipping was reasonable the used version seemed perfect so i decided to play it straight away in the solitude of my bedroom it was almost as good as the vinyl copy i remembered playing years ago but there was something wrong the highs seemed to be lacking a little not quite as musical as i remembered are my ears not what they used to be or is it something else i decide that i needed a comparison so i found a phono preamp and dusted off my vinyl copy there is a subtle difference between the cd copy and the vinyl one cant quite put my finger on it perhaps its in the recording maybe its the 40 year old recording technology i will play the cd version for parties but i will listen to the vinyl version when i am alone|1
had i known that this reproduction of the original cast was not remastered i would not have considered it i had no idea that what i enjoyed in 1944 on an lp was going to be so terrible|0
if you want to hear roger waters talk for 40 mins buy this if you want to hear pink floyd buy any other pink floyd album|0
of course nino rotas score for the godfather is superlative which is what makes this cd such a disappointment given that carmine coppola is conducting the renditions are shockingly ersatz as if the music was being performed by 101 strings orchestra or something i find the rendition tasteless alternately infused with muzak and bombast in my judgment the feel of the music is way off if you listen to music through a clock radio while doing dishes fine but if you are a connoisseur of fine music intelligently and tastefully performed i dont think you are going to like this cd|0
what a pitythis recording has a really good cast but an overrated conductor who apparently suffered from a severe lack of sleep totally ruins the performance the tempi are so ridicuculously slooooow while listening to this set which i fortunately do not own i had to start laughing several times that this recording is spread like a chewing gumonly order these 4 cds if you desire to buy the worst recording available otherwise i recommend that you try one of the versions which include a true conductor solti boulez and karajan offer quite different interpretations that are really worth listening toparsifal contains a lot of wagners most beautiful music after all|0
i dont usually buy a lot of musicals but i made an exception for this one because i enjoyed the show  however i later regretted the purchase  unlike say rent and aida which i listen over and over to again this does get old after a few runs  dont get me wrong  the story and the music itself is lovely but it just doesnt give me the kind of chills that others have done in the past|0
most people might disagree with me about this review but im the person who want the music to be loud and agressive  if you want to know what im talking about listen to minority report signs dantes peak harry potter and the chamber of secrets jurassic park 1 and 2song number one is really cool due to the begining and the fight scene in the plaza the ride is the coolest song with a secondary theme from the movie playing in the backround it has great action and suspense the rest of the music was romatic in a way so i give the soundtrack 2 stars|0
the cd was not in new condition case had 5 cuts music skipped tried numerous times to contact business but never heard from them  dont buy from them|0
i so looked forward to listening to a christmas cd by the burns sisters  however they were not songs of familiarity so was disappointing|0
i thought it was great i had just seen the musical the producers while in london so decided to get the full set plus two others hilarious i do get funny looks from car drivers when while waiting for the lights to change i am laughing my head off this is my sense of humour thanks for your great service|0
this is pretty much of a ripoff  who ever heard of a soundtrack without the songs played in the movie  it only has the filler music some of which is good  but i have never seen this before where they only include the score and not the songs  i bought a used copy for a buck plus 3 dollars shipping  not even worth that  dont buy|0
this is not sibelius no1in fact i dont know what it is  the writeup talks about sanderlingavoid it unless you recognize the music|0
i bought a copy of this cd over 7 years ago at my local library for 100  i got it home and absolutely fell in love with this cd  i loaned the cd to a coworker who wanted to burn a copy for her kids  i never got the cd back and i searched high and low for another copy  i am so glad amazon had it and i was able to order another one  of course it was not a dollar but it is well worth the price  thanks|1
i agree with the reviewer who wrote that this recording sounds wrong from the startbut ekkehard wlaschiha is great as klingsor  if youre into wagners baritone villians you have to hear him do it  hes  one of the best contemporary character baritones  listen to his alberich  on sawallichs ring on emi or watch him in levines video ring or watch  him as telramund on the schneider video of lohengrin with werner herzogs  scenery  his klingsor is right up there|0
back in the nineties i was ready to write rush off  after counterparts and test for echo not to mention 2002s vapor trails and 2004s feedback ep i figured  rush was still a great live ticket but had run its creative course  then in 2007 the band released snakes  arrows  it wasnt perfect but it was a lot better than anything they had releases since their glory days of the 70s and 80s  part of me feared that record would be the bands last hurrah  i am thankful to say that clockwork angels is a wonderful  but not perfect cd  heres a quick breakdownclassic rush songs  caravan bu2b the anarchist halo effect seven cities of gold headlong flight and the garden  all of the songs mentioned are among some of the best material the band has released  usually it takes me a few listens to get into new rush material however i fell in love with both caravan and bu2b on first listen when they were released back in 2010  the anarchist has one of the best rush rifts in years that measures up to other classic rush rifts as freewill and limelight  both headlong flight and seven cities of gold start off with great bass riffs that seem to be inspired by les claypool of primus  both songs end up being incredible rockers finally halo effect and the garden are two of the strongest ballads the band has ever recordedgood songs  i liked the song clockwork angels until i got to the chorus  that chorus sounds as if they came up with the title and wrote the song around it  not a bad song but not great either  wreckers has a good melody but doesnt compare with some of the other songs either  musically carnies is a great song  however lyrically its just okay  here is a sample a face of naked evil   turns the young boys blood to ice  deadly confrontation   such a dangerous deviceforgettable songs  wish them well just doesnt work  weak chorus weak lyrics this is the albums weak spot  also bu2b2 is okay but really doesnt add to the overall composition of the albumat the rate of an album every five years this might be the last new rush to be heard until 2017 if ever  if this is the last rush album at least the band went out with a really good effortpeace|1
i own this on vinyl found it in a cutout bin back in the late 70s i paid about a buck for it its the entire film on record contains the infamous bubbles song and the real thing coke parody|0
there are very few songs that i have heard other artists cover that have surpassed the originalwell this aint itginuwine adds nothing to one of princes classicsinstead he makes it into a bad night at a karoke barno feeling or depth whatsoever here to me|0
i just didnt like the noisy chaotic sound  even though ive heard them before on tv i was truly disappointed in this one but others may enjoy it|0
ill keep this short and sweet after presto id lost the faith i wasnt impressed with it at all the first rush album i owned was exitstage left and for me that was hard to top i caught back up with the band on vapor trails ah yes thats the rush i remember clockwork angels you ask well its just the best damn rush album since moving pictures period ive been listening to it for the last four days basically nonstop all waking hours clockwork angels just summarizes what rush is all about ill probably listen to it for the next month and drive people crazy all of you naysayers it is not moving pictures ii so just move on for a band to grow they must go in new directions you may think otherwise but clockwork is the best rush album yet period|1
flyleaf is amazingi first heard of this band when meeting the lead singers sister and brotherwho attend my high schoolthen i heard their single im so sick on a friends myspaceive been adicted to flyleaf ever since thenbut i am having a bit of trouble finding the album at the stores i go to|1
i love thomas newmans work  this music may have worked in the movie but not as a soundtrack cd  the cues are short and once youve listened to three tracks on the cd youve heard them all  if you have his welcome home roxy carmichael cd and the american beauty st you dont really need this one  only for the most diehard soundtrack collectors|0
i bought this soundtrack on the strength all the 5 star recomendations here after eagerly opening the cd and listening to it i cant believe were hearing the same cd most of the tracks are bland pretty much  generic hollywood stuff just the occasional traditional bagpipe or drum to  remind you that this is the braveheart soundtrack sure i enjoyed the  movie but this cd is far too overrated|0
chavela vargas is known for her rendition of mexican and latin american folkloric music and rancheras she has produced over 80 albums since the early 60s1 chavelas beautiful voice is not present in this album her voice is nothing like it was in the 70 80 90s even her voice in the frida movie sound closer to what it used to be check paloma negra or la llorona on frida soundtrack music her voice at her late 80s found in this cd does not give justice to this wonderful legend2 the songs in this cd are not interpreted in her usual stylein short i would not recommend this cd for anyone except collectors who would like to have everything from her look for a younger chavela vargas in previous albums you can find excellent interpretation in some of her old albums that has been remastered into cds such as noche de bohemia bohemian night boleros volver volver or compilations such as le canta a mexico sentimiento de meacutexico and collecion de oro|0
this is the 8th album of blue system and the worst album of dietereurotrades whole carrier to me but it is the highest charted position of the whole blue systemeurotrades position which was no5 in the german charts the singles were terrible but eurohistoryeurotrade is tolerable but i didneurotradet like any other tracks in this album except that and euromichael has gone for a soldiereurotrade the 2nd single eurooperatoreurotrade was the worst blue system single not only in my opinion but also in the charts as it reached no87i doneurotradet have anything more to say about this album if youeurotradere a collector like me please do buy it even though youeurotradell regret it like i am as i paid 1099 pounds which is a lot for a horrible album like thisfact this is a gold selling album|0
for starters the performance was recorded in a large cathedral and it sounds as if it was miked about halfway back there is a lack of clarity throughout and no stereo spectrum to speak of  if there are any significant dynamic contours in the pieces they are not evident in this recording  many sounds get all but washed out by the huge room only the most deliberate articulations are not hopelessly lost in reverberation  these recordingquality factors probably somewhat taint my impression of the piece but for what its worth i thought it was directionless uninteresting in some moments badly executed and overall largely silly  i dont know if it is intended as a serious work the title itself could certainly suggest a tongueincheek hyperbole that would be consistent with the sort of eccentricity chambers works are known for but it certainly has the scale personnel and presentation of one and as such it falls quite short  its probably worth a second listen though to make sure i didnt miss something remarkable that got sucked up into the er mix  or maybe the joke is just lost on me|0
this cd was a real departure for michael w smith  released right after his i2eye cd it was a complete style change  from 80s poprock to a choral sound  i must admit at first i was really disappointed but the cd has grown on me until its become one of my favoritesthis cd sounds more like a choral album then an artist driven solo project  in fact michael doesnt even have all the solos  the music is full orchestra for a christmas pageant feel  there are very few traditional carols on here except in instrumental form  as a result it takes several listens before it sounds remotely christmassy  however there are some powerful lyrics in the new songs that remind me of the wonder of the first christmas  and gloria is a fun rendition of the classic angels we have heard on high that i have heard performed many times by choirs since this came outdefinitely buy this cd but give it some time before you make up your mind about it  im certainly glad i did because i look forward to hearing it every christmas|1
in theory having exrunning wild members team up with an udo clone to play nofrills german power metal works in theory in practice however this album does not work at all first off the singing is definitely an acquired taste i dont mind udos voice on classic accept albums but this soundalike just does not work well hereon the bigger disappointment is the music running wild has had plenty of talented musicians among their ranks but on savageland these guys really sound like theyre just going through the motions running wild typically has more guitar hooks in the first 30 seconds of a song than this entire album contains savageland isnt awful but it just plods along doing nothing interesting musically the storyconcept doesnt help either being yet another halfbaked fantasy story that comes across as 13 road warrior 13 dune and 13 braveheart which equals 100 hokey anyone wanting a fix of good ol fashioned german power metal would be better off tracking down releases by bands like running wild early accept atlain not fragile galloglass etc etc etc dont get caught up on the idea that these guys are gonna sound like classic running wild given the boring music on this album there may be a good reason that rolf made these guys walk the plank|0
this does not help me sleep at all in fact it annoys me its the same song over and over but just done differently|0
i believe if this album had been recorded by someone else i could have appreciated it a bit moreits just the david sanborn that i was raised on the muzak thing just didnt work for me|0
i got the record in no time and it was in perfect shape  the red vinyl looks kick ass and its nice and heavy  the effects on the album art are coolio|1
this is by far pink floyds greatest album it chronicles the life of a rock n roll artist pink floyd and his plunge into madness this semi autobiographical album has awesome songwriting with a variety of different songs the best songs include1 comfortably numb2 another brick in the wall pt 23 hey you4 run like hell5 the happiest days of our lives6 waiting for the worms7 one of my turns8 young lusta must have for any music fan no collection is complete without it this is rock n roll history|1
this cd starts with the first 2 singles caravan and bu2b who are two strong tracks then the title track clockkwork angels is even better with his catchy melody then its followed by some tracks that shows some interesting moments but the songwriting is not as strong as the first three trackswe have to wait for the song the wreckers to see some more inspiring music where the band is more focused on developing their ideas instead of following their instincts headlong flight is the third single and is another heavy song that is very enjoyable wish them well is the weakest tracks of the cd and the standout track is at the end with the garden showing the band going in a different direction with a powerful ballad with classical arrangements a nice piano break that is the entry to the beautiful alexs guitar solo the lyrics are really perfect here matching the music very well to release all the emotionsthe musicianship on this cd is flawless no surprise coming from this old band but i really think that geddy lee is stealing the show with his bass sound throughout this cd his sound was high in the mix  so we can appreciate all the nuances of his playing as for the influences of the music with previous material all this being purely accidental and subjective i would say that this is a logic evolution of snakes and arrows in terms of music style but very different on the composition level but its obvious that the band sound is closer to their hard rock style of fly by night and 2112 then the sound of their progressive era after those 2 cds the band is now making heavy prog that as more to do with hard rock then prog which is like they were returning to their roots since the counterpartss cdin conclusion clockwork angels is a little stronger then snakes and arrows but there also some inconsistency in the quality level of compositions in the middle of the cd its a solid work but this is not your classic moving pictures|1
who the fukk are the cowboy angels  damn|0
i am an early childhood educator who has always played raffi for the kids in my care  theyre truly singable songs|1
this album is a must for any music collection  complex for sure yet simple this album was written ingeniously lyrically and musically  kudos to producer nick raskulinecz for once again pushing alex geddy and neil beyond themselves musically  for the first time since 1978s hemispheres the album was written as a concept same as 2112 and caress of steel  it except for one album side telling a story in one song this is 12 stand alone songs chronically telling the story of a young mans life journey through a jules vern style nostalgic setting  i dont want to repeat other reviews and writers description telling the story  the album is nonstop and upbeat slowing only during the end song the garden which if you sit and read the lyrics and follow the story as the album plays this song will definately touch you to heart even making you crymaybe it is the most remarkable and indescrible ending to a story or an album it is just a brilliant perfect song for its meaning and the way it brings the story to a close  caravan bu2b headlong flight the anarchist clockwork angles and seven cities of gold are definately power houses at their best  halo effect wish them well and the garden are well toned songs unlike anything these guys have ever done before  brilliant and clever entertaining and even moving  its a must have and definately something the long time rush fans can relate to  for the simple minded person simply put and elementarily it is a story about a young mans hope in life and in all people though his life has only seen people to be deceitful hateful and even dangerousi think the most difficult challenge the guys have with this album is what to play during the tour without playing the entire album  perhaps six songs will be picked as was what they did with snakes and arrows  every song on this album is worthy of a live performance  personally speaking since caravan and bu2b got previewed on the time machine tour not to downplay these songs as they are highlights of the album to do this entire recording justice live skip those two in concert this time and go with all new material  id love to see headlong flight clockwork angles seven cities of gold halo effect wish them well and the garden performed live on this gojust a note alex was interviewed by billboardcom and ed as saying rush will be brining a string ensemble on tour to reproduce the sound of the alubm live  the ensemble may also play some of the classics as well  what will these guys do next|1
no fault of the sellerbut a lot of the beatles 2012 vinyl remasters are defective i just opened this to find theres unlistenable surface noise and static on side 2this is due to poor quality control at record plants capital leased out magical mystery tour was okbut abbey road is unlistenablethe static and surface noise ruins the album|0
i have been to rocky horror 175 times have played frank etc  so now that you think im a total freakthis is the the most embarrassing audience participation i have ever heard  the lines are totally outdated and just not very funny or creative  there are huge gaps where the audience doesnt even say anything at all  maybe this was fun in 1983 but 21 years later i think a new album needs to be made  actually there is audience participation on the dvd so i would say buy the dvd instead of this cd  but maybe the cd is good for the carthis albums only merit used to be finally being able to listen to the entire movie at home since the regular music soundtrack album is edited  but since the movie was released on vhs and now dvd im not sure what point this participation album has anymorepeople are going to listen to this and think the whole thing is dumb  lines like try disneyland and people actually thinking its funny just makes the listener want to cringe  theres also no energy the crowd sounds bored and possibly scripted  no one sounds like theyre having any fun at allno offense to sal or anyone but i just cant stand itthough it was probably really great in 1983  i bet a lot of the people on the recording even cringe when they hear some of the old jokes todaybuy the dvd instead|0
though i have heard other cds featuring marni nixon west side story and disneys mulan among others ive never heard her as weak as she is on this soundtrack she was an incredibly poor choice for the lead rex harrison is still good however and is the main reason i give this cd two stars overall it is definitely not worth your money get the broadway recording instead|0
few albums have the inate ability to transcend the listener to another place and time  since this album was released in the early eighties i have listened to it over 1000 times first on vinyl now on cd and it never  ceases to amaze me how different details come out each time i listen  roger waters puts forth his most impressive work and this coupled with  david gilmour taste for moving symphonic guitar work make the wall a  masterpiece now the movie is another issue|1
green days first album is awful and shows that they where very inexperenced when they first brought this out|0
the cd was sent in a timely fashion and received in good condition  this is a fun engaging cd for young children with raffis best loved songsvery satisfied with seller and would recommend to others|1
im sorry but i dont like this cd the very best is the music that mr larcange recorded with londondecca under the label phase 4 stereo the music the arragements the orchestras the accordion all were spectacularfor our delicious vocalion has reissue at last at last at last after 35 years one of the 2 better lps music of london phase 4 stereo larcange plays legrand and larcange plays aznavourvocalion launched this title 1 cd with the 2 lps last 1st november2004 i hope that amazoncom will have soon in his catalogue if you want this cd now you must write to  they have too the music of ronnie aldrich destination love and love two beautiful lps of the 70s in the best sound for two pianos absolutely recomended|0
i just got one as a gift purchased locally and it is not what i know from my cd copy im not old enough to have heard it first on vinyl  i havent listened to all of side 1 but come together is lacking vocals at least like the mix is offside 2 the first 2 tracks here comes the sun and because seem to be ok here comes the sun is my favorite song and it seems on par but after that the tracks are nonsense the verse vocals from you never give me your money is very quiet and muffled and the chorus vocals are blasting in my face i was hoping it was a bad pressing and not my new table also a gift atlp120 so im sort of glad to hear this might rather have an original than this remasterit doesnt just seem like a bad pressing it seems like a bad master like someone went nuts with buss compression though i know little about the vinyl medium so maybe thats what a bad pressing sounds like i dont have excessive static though i plan to exchange it for a replacement and plan to update this when i get my new copy it is a 2012 digital remaster as far as i can tell|0
the wall is one of the best albums ever made and ranks amongst the greatest rock operas along with tommy and quadropheniathe songs are brilliant especially run like hellanother brick in the wall and comfortably numbhighly recommended for your cd collection|1
my dad really liked this cd  he cant wait to put it on for the holidays when the family can enjoy it together|1
let me be the first to admit that i am an opera dilettante but i know what moves me and what doesnt this recording decidedly didnt move me yes there is some good though for me lackluster singing i only have one real complaint about the singers ghena dimitrova many of the other reviewers found her performance to be exemplary but for me it just didnt work and there were literally points where her voice caused me real physical pain there is a screechiness about her voice that ruined the performance for me on the other hand and perhaps more revealing about my tastes her voice is not nearly as painful to me as that of maria guleghina i have friends in the opera business who assure me that guleghina is a brilliant singer which i dont see i dont know what the general opinion of dimitrova is but i suspect that she is also considered a brilliant singer i have noticed that among aficionadoscritics there is some standard of perfection which stands above or apart from emotional depth in voice performances as a visual artist i have long felt that perfection is often boring and easy in music as in the arts i will always gladly trade perfection for emotional depth|0
very few people will argue about thae fact the wall is one of the greatest albums ever madeone listen to comfortably numb and run like hell will convince of thislong live pink floyd|1
wowjust wow purchased this cd yesterday and was blown away from the startanyone else detect a lil 70s style in a few songs as bu2b and caravan were already releasedevery single song after is amazing and in my opinion some of the best music rush has ever recorded the band is still sounding so awsome so crisp and right on the nuggets i recommend this to any and all rush fans thank you rush for an unbelievable cd heres hoping for more in the futurethis cd alone should wake up those morons over at rolling stone magazine and say hey its time for rush in the rock and roll hall of fame hands down|1
the funniest comedian around i have had this cd for a few years and it never gets old brian regan is as funny as they come his bits on little league and fishing are hilarious|1
a lot of people think that dark side of the moon is the best album by this particular band  while the peak as pop stars coincides and is because of that particular album the artistic peak is the wallwhile self indulgent at times the basic intimacy and the way the album as a whole speaks to the modern human condition makes this album stand out their best artistic achievement by farwhile we dont need no education made a fairly high mark on the charts  the album does not make sense except in its entirety  the album is a story of common bad childhood experiences and the growing alienation of success and adulthood  the emptiness and triviality of success  pink floyd in the arc of the story  lays the banality and alienation of success bare  it ends up blocking the person from the world and the artist from the audience  at one point in the album the artists command the audience to do anything however repulsive anyone been at a rock concert where the band seemed like they could command the audience to do anything and they would  after alientation is complete the main character pink is judged and found guilty  he has to tear down the wall and live a genuine life a result that is both fightening and liberatingwhile not the poppiest of their albums and not their musically best this is the album which shows their artistic peak and is a worthy addition to someone interested in pink floyd|1
people are obvioulsy entitled to judgeits on us to not get misleadedn any review below 4 stars for this album will serve the samemisleading ppl from great musicwell i think ppl who own this know that this is one priceless n timesless albumlisten to this and come to know what kind of things matter in this worldi knowull come to know|1
am buying this on the strength of tiger rose being included on a double cd essential southern rock springsteen wrote it for him or at least gave it to him to release theres hero worship here by the looks no wonder the tele work on this track epitomises everything thats simple yet subtle and great about rockabilly and the voice ive at times pressed the repeat button 2 or 3 times in the car a mood liftertransports one|1
while the song titles are appealing the actual music of the songs is anything but  it was like having the hits of your favorite singer sung by a simon cowell reject after hearing them i promptly deleted them from my computer and tossed the cds|0
the case was cracked when i received it  however what can i expect for something that i bought for half of what the stores charge for it  loves me some floyd so im not complaining too much|1
talkin sht is a downgrade from martin lawrences previous albumfunk it here he gets personal perhapsno definitely too personal but at times the comedy and humor just falls flat the album starts off slow but does pick up with three great tracks of observations and jokes in the middle michael jackson ilaldo and white kidsblack kids here he rips apart celebrities like the jackson family and geraldo as well as child rearing this albums effort isnt anything to rush out and listen to and even fans of lawrences comedy may be disappointed|0
i saw brian regan open for seinfeld circa 19921993 and i have been a fan ever since the cd is the next best thing to seeing him liveand it is awesome i guarantee you will not stop laughing brian regan is a comedy genius and he doesnt need profanity to add to his humorits completely clean and it just doesnt get any better than this|1
way to many lush violins a few cuts are ok not the best of desmonds albums|0
the sound is not the best|0
i love les miserables love it i love it did i mention i love it since i found out we were going in the summer i decided to listen to the recording first this was the only one we hadand well its not that good i dont want to step on any toes here for those of you that do like this recording this is just my opinion so lets beginvaljean colm wilkinson is just well good and it pains me to say that knowing how amazing he was in the 10th anniversary although alfie boe nearly knocked him out of the water with his performance but in this recording wilkinson sounds overly dramatic and desperate if you want to listen to colm wilkinson despite what ive said he is a good singer get the 10th anniversaryjavert terance mann was eh okay hes fine in the part just not as strong and powerfulfantine randy graff is just not fantine she sounds bored to death in i dreamed a dream than tries to make up for it in the end of the song by yelling this becomes horribly obvious in come to me like i dreamed a dream she sounds a little bored at the beginning adding a little trill of vibrator coseeete its tuuuuuuuurned so coooold then she proceeds to belt what just should not be belted and tell cosette i love her and ill see her when i waaaaaaaaaaaaakemarius david bryant is just well not that good hes overly dramatic at times in his performance he sounds as if he is in desperate need of bowel movementcosette cosette is just not interesting although in this recording i find her incredibly interesting because judy kuhn who sings the part is honestly the only one who sounds good in this recordingeponine yeah i dont know what everyone is seeing er hearing in her voice shes horrible nasally and whiny at times she sort of mumbles through her song see on my own and now im all alone again no where to turni know the book says that eponine had a rough voice but this is a musical not a book frances rufelle is bad this is unfortunate because she sings my favorite songs on my own and a little fall of rainthis is definitely not the best recording there is i advise you to get 10th anniversary cd or 25th anniversary dvd the only reason i can see to buying it is if youre collecting all the les miserables recordings|0
i got this album as a japanese edition now sold at very low price so i decided to give it a try after i saw max roach was in the game sincerely i cant believe max roach played on an album ugly such as this one considering he was such a star i checked allmusic review and even them that generally speaking are precise in their ratings find this album interesting and hasaan a talent in a certain way unbelievable to my ears im sorry to say this but this album is probably the worst i have in my many thousands jazz albums collection hasaan has a very weird and wrong uninteresting approach to music no melody at all a lot of notes a lot of weird phrases that surprise surprise succed in the hard task of going nowhere and say nothing no way its running up and down scales and chords with no meaning whatsoever im still listening to this album right now and cant understand who was the guy in atlantic who decided that this boring and fastidious garbage had to be released in times when you had monk recording or pianists of gigantic stature bill evans phineas newborn and i could go on forever  in this album theres a monumental max roach who plays fantastic as always but under a music sooo bad its unbelievable i hate to say this of a max roach album but its pure garbage rightly no record company let the legendary hassan take another try and record another amatorial effort like this one i dont sell it only because i like the cover and theres max roach on it horror|0
really thought the voices and choruses were a little too amateur for these songs i understand these are home sung songs mostly but the blend and timbre were just not pleasant i created a playlist in itunes and substituted some better arrangements into it example dixie really didnt have it prefer norman luboff|0
if you listen to pink floyd for roger waters cynical lyrical commentary  then this album is for you it features some of his highest poetry  showcasing the futility of war and frustrations of societys more  disgruntled members however if you are more interested in playing air  guitar to have a cigar than you likely find this album to be a complete  drag musically its rather bland and pasted together with none of the  intricate radiance heard best on wish you were here probably due to the  details of waters expulsion wright and intolerance of influence from  gilmour or mason on this work i also agree that this was the first waters  solo album in everything but name this album is not in my opinion pink  floyd but a side factor of the bands existance and thus not as good|0
rush has had a very long career now on their 19th studio release not counting feedback or any compilation albums  they have traversed from rock through the synthnew wave era to using a lot of keyboards to using less keyboards to getting heavier and back solidly into the rock relm  clockwork angels is an amazing mixture of heaviness new ideas and old reminders  from the beginning band entrance in caravan the album takes you on a musical story and journey  the musicianship is stellar as always  you can hear throwbacks to earlier albums check out the bastille day reference in headlong flight  the boys are belting it out throughout the album  the anarchist is my favorite being driven rhythmically  all the while the band it tight and certainly knows how to play off each other  after this time i am sure its second nature to them hehyou all get that reference to hold your firewhat an amazing studio release that i absolutely cannot wait to hear live  if its anything like mr pearts lyric in caravan it will be big|1
every song on this album is good it highlights slashs versatility as well as acting as a showcase for the talented myles kennedy  my new favorite vocalist|1
and even after youve memorized the routines you will listen again and still laugh until it hurts brian regan is hilarious i can remember about 15 years ago watching him on tv doing his watching fishing on tv routine where he marvels that the shows have a writer whats he have to write ooh shes a beauty i love his material about growing up and especially when he was in school maybe my favorite line is about how he waited until the morning of to do his science project putting dirt in a cup the teacher then asks him to explain it well its a cup    wih dirt in it i call it cup of dirt listen to brian tell the story and deliver the line and youll be hooked|1
fortunately the lp soundtrack and the original cd recording of the lp are both terrific  i have both and am glad to have them because this rerecording is pathetic|0
with his first seasonal effort smith gives us absolute perfection  there isnt a weak one in the bunch and smiths album is seamless and flows beautifully  so many great moments the best of which i would have to  think is all is well which still remains my personal favorite  of smiths  this is the one that is in the cd player when christmas rolls  around and it certainly has many memories attached with it  nice work  smitty  bravado|1
this is truly a rock opera masterpiece  waters has reached his apex with this album  although i think a warning is in order here for newer floyd fans this is not dark side of the moon if you are even remotely suicidal this is not for you  if exploring the dark side of humanity and emotion is not a problem for you then i think you will find new nuances in this every time you listen to it and a rewarding musical piece|1
i like pink floyd i once owned several pf vinyl lps back in the day but when i heard this slab of gloom i just could not handle it this is the most dark and depressing music that pf have ever released and this is from a band that made a career of darkness and depression so you can imagine just how bad this ismusically its brilliant but the lyrics and theme drag it all down into an abyss then the band released the movie and added depressing images to the music i actually sat through the wall movie in a theater and i felt like committing suicide when i lefti hope roger waters sought professional help after recording this|0
have you ever wondered why the bread they use for sub sandwiches has a sort of yellowish color to it|0
if a celtic harp for christmas is good then a harp and cello are even better  the deep smooth richness of virginia krons cello perfectly balances kim robertsons sprightly sparkling harpestry  the musical fare is similar to that of robertsons solo album celtic christmastraditional holiday carols many familiar and few obscure but all enjoyable  peaceful resonant and calming this is perfect music to counterbalance the dreaded holiday stress  put on some warm slippers sip a fragrant herbal tea and let yourself unwind  robertson and kron also recorded another lovely album together the warmhearted gratitude which is sure to win your heart as well  two other gently entrancing christmas recordings worth checking out are norland winds december journey and one wintry night by hammereddulcimer player jerry read smith and his wife flutist lisa maria smith|1
sounds like elevator music to me|0
i am a great fan of bjh and have most of their albums  i added xii last week  it sucks   the recording is very poor and the vocals seem off key  their earlier offerings such as mocking bird were far better  recording qualitymy recommendation for the best bjh album live tapes   this has the most amazing performances on it|0
raffi songs  i used raffis songs and albums in my preschool classroom for years  i bought this collection for my 3 and 5 year old granddaughters for christmas along  with a cd player  they will love this cd collection for sure|1
i love hellraiser 3 but this new release is just horrible  i am so glad that they rerelease hellrasier 3  but this dvd is so bad  the movie is so fuzzy and it is fullscreen pan and scan  the last outofprint edition from paramount is widescreen and sharp picture and has a very nice menu with english subtitle and 2 special features  this new edition has nothing at all  just play and chapter selectionvery disappointed  do not buy even if you love hellraiser and it is only 5 bucks|0
if you havent heard this guy you should soulful smooth voice and fluid guitar  nothing fancy just heartfelt blues you can kick back and enjoy the groove with  hell be missed|1
animals is perhads the worst pink floyd album i ever heard the songs seem to go on forever the lyrics are bad and roger waters singing is not much better so who knows what they were thinking when they made this albumi hate to say it but the only reason i didnt give this album a one star rating was the two part song pigs on the wing which unlike the rest of animals is actually a half decent song|0
pink floyd was a intresting band that played a very strange music its a some kind miracle that pink floyd came so popular and cult band this doubledisc album is their most ambitious protect  there are many classic songs that you can hear on the radio or disco for exemple another brick on the wall part 2 which came one of the floyds music listeners favourites my own favourite songs are dramatic mother brilliant the thin ice aggressive hey you and awesome confortable numb there are too many ballads on the wall and some weak lenks for exemple one of my turns all in all this album is just another brick on the great music wall which stays there until the end of the world|1
fans of jim gaffigan jerry seinfeld and other observational humorists will enjoy this excellent cd it is original funny and clever|1
ok as far as budget productions go ive heard worse still i cant see why you would buy this version when there are so many good versions of this musical on the marketif you do decide to buy it bear in mind that the orchestration is very poor and the voices are nothing special judas is alright though|0
you would think this would be a good cd it isnt so manyproblems the first single  im so sick also the firstsongsee when you do thatthe first single should neverbe the first song it shows a lack of originality the 1stsong of albums is usually one of the best if the 1st sigleis 1 what does that say for the rest of the album imso sick is the best song on the album and the heavyestagain that song is ka kicka but there are no songs asgood as thatit gets dissapointing after thatsongs are soso nothinnew same stuff you hear on the radio every day there areonly a few other good songs one of which is im sorryone slow down song too which is alright  there for youpretty short album the songs dont drag on which is goodi guess every song except for the last song last song is thelongest another thing you shouldnt do is about 3 minutes orshorter the chick has a really interesting voice but itdoesnt get used in its full potential to songs on thisalbum which is allaround fair|0
first album was great having been a hagar fan for 30 years i loved it but after waiting for a year or so for chickenfoot3 i was disappointed with it never thought id see the day i wrote a negative thing about sammy hagar but this album iswell weak sorry sammy its how i feel|0
excuse me im a fan of animal rights and all but to change a classic story line to appease current popular opinion is disgustingwhats next the wicked witch gets probation beacause she really didnt mean to kill snow white with the poisoned apple|0
rush has shown just how great a band they truly are with the production of the garden on this albumwe are all familiar with all their classic hits but this song has shown another side of rush that is equal to anything and perhaps better than anything they have done to datethis song could easily be the centerpeice of a twilight movie soundtrack or some other movie of similar scope  that might sound strange and perhaps unimpressive to many rush fans whos children or grand children are more twilight than rush fans  but this song is truly beautiful and has a message that those that have their whole lives and hopes ahead of them could easily reachif it were on such a soundtrack i have no doubt it would win a grammy  an apology is in order to rush from whichever rock critic at the rock and roll hall of fame has until now not recognized their immense talent  stellar workthis song is an anthem  and is the piece that has a message worthy of all the songs that built up to it|1
i first became  aware of bernard hermans fabulouse music when i saw the moviepysco i was only 8 years old in 1960 my parents were already into hitchcockstv show so when the contraversal movie pysco came out  they took me and my brothers and sisters to a drive in theater to see it of coarse it was defintlynot a movie for kids like everyone else i was most terified by the shower scenei had a lot of nightmares and questions for my parents about what certain things ment for instance the word transsexual i wont even print what their resposewas as it is totally laughable for todays world but i was covenced of one thingas terififing as the movie was it was the most unforgettable movie that iv ever seen especially the soundtrack the music was so kool thats when i got into bernard herman and decided that i must have as  many of his soundtracks as possiblenot all of them are as interesting as others there are a few trackshere that display his infectouse sound  such as the opening tracks on the daniel webster suite but alot of these collections are nothing more than poor imitationsand reworks of the masters work its best to stick with the cds that featurebernard herman conducting the orchestra|0
pink floyds the wall is one of the greatest concept albums of all time comparable to the whos rock opera tommy the wall tells the story about a man called pink whos a rock star with a mental breakdown in reality pink is a methaphor for roger waters after losing his father in the war the wall part 1 he also got very troubled youth especially at school where they see him just as another brick in the wall and pink starts to build a heavy wall around himself wall part 2 but eventually succeeeds in life with becoming a rock star with a lot of groupies and a great wife but things starts to turn sour when his wife sees another man and he realize that the music business is just a circus and hes just used his wall is eventually complete wall part 3 he gets a nervous breakdown smashes his hotel room spits at a man in the audience and gets hospitalized but he still hallucinanates and see himself as an evil dictator eventually he cant take it no more and must break down the wall once for all the trial outside the wallall of the songs on the wall got a purpuse thats why it is so majestic to listen to the whole album song by song several songs are brilliant aswell the title track another brick in the wall part 2 was the song that in 1980 was a smash hit and feautures a partly animated video and children singing in choirs it also feautures a legendary david gilmour guitar solo  in the flesh sounds like a great opener gig from a concert and not surprisingly it is the opener here too mother is the song about the overprotecting mother and a truly beautiful song aswell and young lust about all thye groupies they had at their peak hey you starts really slow but eventually sounds like an emotional breakdown when gilmour plays the guitar in such a haunting way comfortably numb is one of those songs that most people have heard partly cause its a fantastic floyd song but also partly cause of the guitar solo that is top 5 of all time run like hell is also good a features some classic floyd sound effects that makes it worthwile there are ofcourse many other songs too i didnt mention there are 26 songs overall but many of them are short and barely over one minute that sounds more like sound clips from films listen to all of the songs however thats what the concept is aboutconclusion for me the wall is one of the greatest rock albums of all time and one of those occasions where a double album isnt too much although not all songs are that good they are part of a concent or the wall so to say and serves a great purpose to the album concept its also profoundly personal from roger water where he tells his life story song by song just like a book you never can stop reading and to have a man like david gilmour in the band that can play the guitar like few others is fundamental on a album like this great music combined with interesting lyrics and personal subjects is one of the reasons why this album is so great the wall is a must have for rock fans its one of the albums where you can capture pink floyds greatness at best 5 stars|1
great pictures of some of the great forgotten bands of the 80s this book is a must for people who lived or was in a band through the era and for people who would love to know more on those underground glam sleaze bands well worth it|1

rembetic music isnt something you hear often  if you have ordinary musical tastes your chances of hearing rembetiko are on par with your chances of being struck by lightning  if you like things that are just a little strange you could still live your whole life and never hear of it for the uninitiated rembetiko kind of like the blues in that the themes are mostly the same hardluck women nogood men drinking hashish and poverty  it sounds a bit like other greek music although often more mournfulrosa eskenazi has a beautiful voice  often in the slower songs the accompaniment will fall silent to let her sing alone for an entire verse  of course its a pity that these tracks were made at a time and place when the recording quality wasnt the best  however like the best old records this one has soul and transcends its limitations  only four stars were awarded because there were a handful of tracks i didnt care for|1
i remember while most teenagers in the mid to late 90s were listening to pop rap country or crappy alternative stuff that was apssing for rock i was listening to bands teens 10 and 20 years prior were listening to scorpions motley crue led zeppelin rush acdc to name just a few but all bands you know and many you could probably guess  rush happened to be one of my favorites out of the lot  my picks for best and worst albums would differ greatly from typical rush fans but regardless of album i could at least find enjoyment in half the album if not the whole thing  this caused some troubles with some of the 70s stuff which only had 4 or 6 songs but hey  2112 is an amazing albumunfortunately this album just didnt grab me  for starters the production was a little too muddy though i could overlook that with better songs  and thats where this album really falls flat  the song writing is just ok at best  theres nothing to capture ones attention with most of them  they arent really bad or anything theyre just there  you have caravan which started the album off to a decent note but that being the first single had i known would have worried me as its only a decent song halo effect is by far my favorite song on here  i love the acoustic guitars and the rest of the band puts in a solid effort beautiful song  garden had nice acoustic guitars as well but i think i was hoping for more reading how much others like this song  its still decent thoughthe album feels like a bunch of ideas they decided must go into the album without thought to how theyd work together  one song has this random bluesy acoustic guitar piece which sounds really cool and all but really doesnt fit the song and just comes from out of nowhere though probably the best part of that song  the vocal melodies are flat out boring and uninspiring  the guitar riffs mostly are the same though there are a few stand out riffs to be found  headlong flight has a great riff and awesome verses setting up to be a great fast paced rocker however the chorus which isnt that great completely changes the pace and not in a way that works  the song gets ridiculously slow  i get songs can change pace and like many songs which do this but this particular song it didnt work  bu2b or whatever had the same problem  the verses were kind of groove rock and the chorus got all fast in a way that didnt work for methe main problem is this album is forgettable  ive had to listen to it several times even to remember a lot of the songs and even now i can only remember parts of some of them  i shouldnt have to listen to an album 15 times for something to grow on me  there should be a few songs which stand out imediately and there werent just a couple that later grew on me  it seems when rush tries to put out an album of more than 8 or 9 actual songs not counting instrumentals they lose focus  if theres another album in them i really hope they take their time with it and really focus on the songs rather than just slapping every idea they have together and hoping it fits  these guys are better than thisoverall this album felt like it was just all over the place with almost nothing worth coming back for  if youre a rush fanatic youll enjoy it  if you like rush but accept that not all their work is gold you may want to listen to it first and if you like it then buy it|0
i use this cd every day it seems to be an easy way to meditate and it refreshes me in the afternoon i would recommend this very highly|1
not really noteworthy if you want hard celtic rock i would recommend wolfstone insteadmuch more talent than these boys|0
this music is lovely and relaxing the track hahahel has a jazzy ambience provided by the piano melody i like the ieiazal piece the best it is very soft and reflective|1
sure this cd set is out of print but the lowest asking price here is 217usdthere is not a great deal you get for the money the 2 cds only run for 75min total i give this cd 1 star only due to the outrageous price 5 stars for the musicif you have a spare 200 you are better off with the 20 cd  box set the complete miles davis at montreux 19731991|0
i have listened to and own many standup comedy cds but brian regans live cd is one of the funniest cds i have ever heard i nearly wrecked my car the first time i heard it because i was laughing so hard that my eyes were tearing upas an added bonus there is no crude subject matter or language on this cd so it is appropriate for the whole family and the subject matter even entertained my teenagers|1
i have 3 kids in 3 different schools and my mornings can get very hectic when i listen to this morning meditation my morning and the rest of my day is guaranteed to be stress free i just love waking up and meditating to this it gives you so much good energy|1
what kind of music do you imagine when you hear the words cuban music  those who dont know much about it might imagine something impassioned but rather naive however what you hear on this cd is the ultimate of sophistication  for example the phrases played by the flute which you can listen to at the intro of comprension is played so skillfully and gorgeously that it has no peer except hubert laws and malena burkes skill of singing and her voice give us wave of sentimentality but they arent  any kind of saccharine sentimentality anyhow you cant  be disappointed by the cd if you like buena vista social club or such female singer like sarah vaughan even though you dont know much about cuban music|0
geoffrey oryema is a relatively new artist for me  i became a fan of his work from a music sampler song was market day another album  i bought 3 of his albums this being the lasti was not disappointed  i found this album a bit different from night to night and beat the border meaning it had some more traditional sounding stuff on it  by that i mean stuff i deem as more traditional african music via beat and style  not bad but not what i love about g  i fell in love with the somber low voice of geoffrey and this album continues that style  i am glad i found him as an artist and this album continues to solidify him as a wonderful and powerful singer  simple can be better  if you have any of his albums and want more this is a great addition to your collection|1
this album is hilarious and with the exception of him saying what the hell about 5xs it is clean and family friendly  but its humor everyone can appreciate|1
the single most appealing piece in the year of living dangerously original soundtrack notice the lower case would surely be vangeliss lenfant  this is the beautiful instrumental music that accompanies the love scene where sigourney weaver jill walks through the rain to mel gibsons guy hamiltons office where she wordlessly confesses that she is overwhelmed by her feelings for him  if youre buying the year of living dangerously original motion picture soundtrack you may naturally expect this keystone piece to be included because it is indeed part of the original soundtrack ie the music that accompanies the film  bad news  its not there  the rest of the music while interesting could best be described as incidental  the astute consumer may notice that a part of the sleeve announces original music by maurice jarre  i was extremely disappointed  this may be a vangelis problem since the week before i had purchased what was advertised as the bladerunner soundtrack and was similarly disappointed to find it was not the original soundtrack nothing on the cd itself claimed to be the soundtrack but instead some pieces that had been featured in the film along with some other pieces all recorded by vangelis on a separate occasion and in my opinion disappointing  i now believe that amazon has the obligation to notify the consumer on their website advertisement of this product that these albums are not what they seem and most certainly to drop the ots and the word soundtrack from the bladerunner album|0
the cd itself is good but not fantastic  i just got back from seeing them play live though and whoa  they played a small venue here and tore down the house  they are extremely energetic the music is crisp and lacey sounded and looked great  i went because a friend of mine had an extra ticket so i figured what the heck  i was not disappointed  the cd doesnt do the live show justice and for that i give it 4 stars  if theyre coming to a place near you though definitely check them out|1
pink floyd is in my top four rock groups  the wall is one of their three best albums  i will enjoy this cd for the rest of time|1
i am very disappointed in this cd the beauty of maori music is in the choral singingthe blending of voicesthis album is mainly solo renditionshiri maori songs is so much better|0
the original band was roger waters nick mason and rick wright then syd came that was when the name pink floyd was taken in use afterwards dave gilmour came then the main writer thou rick also wrote roger waters left 1983 officially 85 momentary lapse of reason 1987 is written by gilmour and some unknown dudes pure pink floyd cdas to talk about pink floyds greatest times i think the band was on their best around dark side of the moon years when all band members were in making of the music composing bringin ideas after dark side roger slightly became the person who made almoust all of the songs and ideas animals and so on till 83 thats part of the reason why rog left but thats when pink floyd was on their best roger has made really good music from 73 and will keep doing so now pink floyd is david richard and nicklike i said momentary lapse of reason is written by david gilmour and some other people nick mason and rick wright only play on the cd and their part on the cd is clearly being dimished the music include a couple nice sections but mainly the music is poor whithin melodies and it repeats itself too much the tunes are actually quite popstylish and unlike in waterss songs there isnt a lot of melodies and variations the lack of changing melodies has been replased with technical tricks theres much much too much dave gilmours guitar solos i mean he can make good solos but in this album theres too much tricks and all those electric effects music should be more real you arent listening techno arent youand lyrics i dont think all have to say about them they are the weakest part of the album this album maybe beholds some of the worst pink floyd lyrics of all times new machine parts 12 really sucki say you should by roger waterss pros and cons of hitchhiking its much better even though you might not realize it straight awaymomentary lapse of reason is made just to take money from pink floyd fans and it isnt really a real pink floyd album|0
undeniable spiritual quality infuses this music angels seem to inhabit it ministering to the listener mere stereo speakers suddenly receive the capability to exude warmth and love harsh events occurring in the world are shut out by an overwhelming gentleness put this on the stereo at christmastime and create a background of peace and joy this is truly a gift to the entire world for christmas|1
i dont even know why i bought this cd  i was at lifeway lookin through music and i have a list of cds i wanna buy and i try to stick to the list or else ill never finish it  id never even heard of flyleaf until i saw their cd on the shelf there but i bought itas soon as i got in my car i threw it in the cd player and the first 10 seconds of im so sick played and they started doin the whole screaming thing and im not really into that so i decided right then and there eh i dont like it but i just skipped to the next track  then i let the whole album play and thought eh its ok and then i replayed the first track and realized that it too was alrightso far this review doesnt really sound 5 star worthy but i havent stopped playing the album since then and i love itmy favorite track is 11 so i thoughtfollowed by 5 sorrowbut really there isnt a single song on this album that i dont liketheres none of them that i just decide to skip through to get to the good stufftheyre all good stuff to me|1
the only document of jacos ability to lay in with a straight up jazz ensemble in this instance piano and drums jaco struggles at times soloing in a restrained manner but overall lays in very well his timing is perfect and his tone was excellent and sounds different than his other acoustic 360 sounding works it is interesting to hear one of the giants of fusion reverting to straight jazz but fusion was petering out when this recording was made this is a rarely heard side of jp and should be a must for any jaco fanalso jaco was completely clean at this stage of his life 1986 living in san francisco with melvin drums in melvins mothers home jp was calm and it shows in this recording  he is not so impulsive and insistent his close friend bob bobbing called his style creative overplaying but you dont hear that in this recording this has much feel of west coast cool jazz melvin is who checked jp out of bellvue and watched over him when jp insisted on going back to nyc that concludes the final sad chapters of his life|0
these guys suck they are just 4 irish noobs one died in 1966 a second committed suicide in 1980 who got sick of eating potatoes  cabbage and decided to try to make music instead this sorry bunch of musicians clearly had no taste  why did they leave the album cover blank the worst part is that they couldnt even spell their band name right  its supposed to be spelled beetles|0
there isnt much out there for we who want to relax and practice our faith at the sametime i thought this was a good cd|1
first let me say i know this album well and it is essential for any fan of ron dante or the archies the problem here is that the mastering is so godawful poor it seems to be mastered from a recordand judging from the nauseating sound of all the side two tracks 610 the record used was pressed offcenter artwork bears no resemblance to original and mine came with a booklet but no tray card add to that the fact that 2 tracks are missing from the original release and this makes the disc useless most dante fans already have a copy of the vinyl and that is a superior copy to own at this point wait for ron to reissue this himselfhell do better|0
as for the music it is great music like all of the beatles songs but back in the time when this music was released help was a soundtrack to the movie without the added additional tracks which replaced all the george martin orchestra and other orchestra tracks it was a true movie soundtrack this is what i want to hear i cant believe after 45 years of putting out remastered music this wasnt on anyones minds i guess they may be waiting for us old timers who be the only ones to recognize it to die off and sell it for some new lost music to a new group of listenersdisappointed|0
while the album has a more polished feel than the ep flyleafs debut album is something to invest in  in an industry where negativity is more present than not in lyrics its refreshing to have a great female voice singing about the good things in the world  it might sound cheesy but its done with tact and it inspires nearly all who listenlacey mosley the woman who fronts the band has a very unique voice  shes pint sized and has quite an edge with her vocalsjared james pat and sameer are what back her in their hard rock endeavor and are just as wonderful  all of them stand out in their own lightthis album is certainly a must have if you like female fronted rock  i know im a fan of it if its done well and this album proves without a doubt that flyleaf is one of those bands|1
although it lacks the vision behind beatles white or the dexterity of lamb lies from genesis the wall can take its place amongst rocks finer double albums if not accentuating production subtlety certainly producing a virtual hit factory which could joyously be disassembled piece by piece|1
i picked this up because the local radio station 897powerfmcom plays some of this bands songs on the air  i love this entire cd  what great vocals and lyrics  i am a new fan of this band and i look forward to picking up their ep and future releasesthe best way that i can think of to describe them is broomtree vocals with tree 63 or benjamin gate tunes  the lead singers voice is incredible i admit that i like the fact that a woman can yell like thatthis one is going on my mp3 player and on my review forum at |1
this is a great collection of songs it covers so many different styles of music i love it it even has a few classical songs on it my personal favorite is comfortably numb mainly because of david gilmours brilliant solos but i enjoy every other song too the only problem that i could find is that they added two songs for the movietigers broke free what shall we do now which are great songs but are very hard to find on cd but i guess i cant knock the album for it definately something to check out|1
much as i normally like pink floyd i hate this album maybe im the wrong person to be reviewing it since its opposed to world war ii and i feel wwii was the only conflict of the past century worth fighting but even when judged on terms other than that its still a boring album containing three four if youre counting the reissue mucho overrated floyd songs the arenarock excess of not now john generally considered the albums high point the dull ballad your possible pasts which tries and fails to inject interest with the softloud dynamics the whiny fletcher memorial home and annoying dirge when the tigers broke free but thats not all it doesnt get much worse than the postwar dream unless youre talking about the heros return or paranoid eyes and there are a bunch of brief songs southampton dock get your filthy hands off my desert one of the few that do little but move the plot along and are of low quality the meager highlight is the title song with gilmour taking a typically firstrate guitar solo even then the string arrangements virtually the same as comfortably numbs waters unwisely takes vocals everywhere and his voice is overly pinched and nasal giving it a very whiny sound id take dark side of the moon wish you were here meddle animals or piper at the gates of dawn over this any day|0
i love the beatles i own all their albums but i never listen tothis onethere are some good songs like a hard days night i shouldhave known better and cant buy me lovethe truth is is that aside from these songs the album coveris the best partmy problem with this album is that almost all of the songssound like filler tracks or the beatles trying to be the kinksnot the beatles which is what they were good at if yourenew to the beatles and this was the first album of theirs youbought dont be discouraged go buy the blue albumthe preformance quality on these songs isnt good the beatles sound like they did this disc just to take commercial advantage of the movie they dont sound energetic on more than half of the tracks and most of the songs have no meaning and are pointlessmost are two minute halfeffort run throughs that make the listener bored if the group were to record this album with the same songs even two years laterit wouldve been better but they sound like a fish out of wateri think their songwriting wasnt completly developed at that time notice they did cover tracks on the next album also notice how much more sincere that one sounds if this was the bands only or first album they wouldve never made it they sound like the monkees here this is terrible im sorry you guys cant stand me criticizing a beatles album but this is the worst trust me i have all of their albumspoor playing manufactured sound bad album|0
being a relatively new floyd fan after listening to this album and dark side of the moon theyve rocketed to being one of my favorite bands i think any album that sends chills up your spine and sets your hairs on end has to have some kind of impact on its listener  the wall certainly does that to mei like everything on the  album the songs and the shorter pieces they all fit together seamlessly  imhoroger waters has written some awesome lyrics lyrics people can  identify with which is why the wall is so popular then  theres the music wow wow wow it has to be heard to be believed the  solo on comfortably numb floors me everytime i hear itdont  believe the hype saying its the best album ever though it very well could  be dont worry about picking up an overated album buy this  one because you want to hear and appreciate some of the most  thoughtprovoking and touching music ever made a classic enjoy|1
i got this cd from my library first before trying to buy it i am glad that i did and no i did not purchase it this isnt belly dance music it is a reissue amazon has the other cd with a different cover by legacywhich is the one my library had please read the reviews on that cd as it is the same as this one this is romslavic music and more in line with folk dancing and not the traditional belly dancestudents of egyptianturkish etc would be better off not trying to get this cd for belly dance|0
only one cool song the rest is open to interpretation not to cool better off to buy the song digitally|0
not what i was expecting  i wish i could return it or exchange it at amazon for something else|0
the wall isnt the best work of pink floyd many people say that but that isnt true imo and roger waters is one of the best songwriters everbut dont say that only roger waters wrote the wall everyone says that the wall is roger his work but david gilmour also wrote the most part of comfortably numbrun like hellyoung lust that are imo the best songs on the album|1
the final cut is probably the only pink floyd record that i could call bland this record has no color no imagination or essence like  their other work this just shows that when left alone to vent his spleen  roger waters can let his stories and concepts surge way ahead of the music  theres nothing here from gilmour except his fine as always playing  wrights gone and mason well he pounds the skins very well  while other  floyd works like the wall a momentary lapse of  reason dark side of the moon animals  wish you were here the division bell and even  early soso experiments like meddle and atom heart  mother have certain colorfull if at times not all conceptual  messages and themes now i love roger waters ive seen him in concert and  i have his solo records but he does have a bit of an ego problem and the  fact that he constantly slogs his former mates for carrying on as floyd  kind of depresses me the final cut is a good example of what i  mean take the concept from waters one would expect the same brilliance he  displayed in the wall and animals but instead he  wastes the whole album on what is basically a political rant that would  seem to be ok but coming from him this album just tends to drag on one  of the walls few flaws as well  mr gilmour is  essentially a session player here which is one of the reasons the album  suffers gilmour does not get the respect he deserves instead of  compliments on his fine musical achievements with post waters floyd he  gets attacked for not being an addept lyrisist on this album  gilmour contributes no music he didnt even want to and its plain to see  why when waters gets an idea in his head being not as musically inclined  as gilmour he lets the idea take over the record which finally brings me  to the songs there are some great tunes here like not now  john the gunners dream and the title song they are all  in the same vain as the pieces on the wall both in rhythm and  texture with slow beats and excellent leads but they just are not  memorable and dont stand out well in floyds vast catalog as a floyd  completeist i do own the final cut and its not a total loss  but  definately one of waters lower points apparently even the best of  them stumble once in a while|0
mel brooks is hilarious but the cost is much too high for this package|0
my bose cd player sent up a screen that said disc unplayable the system would not accept the disc i was really looking forward to those pond sounds again i was sent around and around in circles to nowhere when i tried to return it using amazons internet instructions this disc too ended up in my wastebasket|0
i just listened to nutcracker from this disc there are liberties taken with the tempoliberties tschaikovsky did not indicatethat are far beyond the bounds of good taste the famous bass clarinet part in the dance of the sugarplum fairy is awful its actually worth listening to as a lesson in what not to do|0
the wall is just one of those recordings that everyone is going to compare in context with where they were in their lives when the first heard it  for me it was junior high school  the album had just been released and while cruising with my just old enough to drive friends i discovered this music that took weirdness and art and rock and mixed it together until you couldnt tell where one started and another element stoppedthe sound effects first hooked me then the songs then the story then the guitar then the production  in short this album has everything  just experience it  my only fear is that newcomers will read the hype and then compare it to the hype  im just glad i was burdended with no expectations before listeningthe biography of the band at this stage is interesting but not essential  this album stands on its own  its the level of art that townshends rock operas never quite reached  listen enjoy think and enjoy some more|1

while other great bands cash in on their early fame and personalities rush is doing something strange  these artists are actually continuing to create art in the form of albums  new work which adds to the legacy of a great band  i know when i see them live this year that these songs will hold up to the classics  i have enjoyed listening to clockwork angels and it gets better the more i listen to it the way good albums should|1

myles kennedy and slash collaborated and made this awesome cd the cd rocks and the vocals are amazing if you are a fan of rock and you like slash you need to buy this cd now|1
this is a good interpretation but the cd is ruined by the sound engineering that is over the top the louds are much too loud and the softs too soft so that you have to constantly adjust the volume to compensate as is the sound is nothing like a normal concert hall performance it has been sound engineered to death by over the top engineers who think exaggeration is good it isnt|0

wow tina sacchi has done it again i have known tina for several years and consider her a mentor and a friend i have recommended her cds to dozens of my patients and have repeatedly gotten positive feedback from people who try them i personally own all of her cds and listen to them regularly tinas new cd is titled survive cancer now but it really is much broader than cancer tina guides the listener through a wonderful process to replace all types of disease with excellent health happiness and love no matter the source of the disease this process can be very empowering in a culture where so many people view themselves as victims of disease i highly recommend this cd as well as tinas other hypnotherapy cds|1

well i have two words for yall headlong flight track 9 incredibly fast stunning and brilliant single stroke chops oh and a amazing bridge the entire album is a kick in the head tracks 812 being my favourites i simply cannot comprehend that 3 guys pushing their sixties and  wtf  20thish studio lp are still touring kicking complete a and taking names  who needs water  must be geds bourgogne i got the uk fan pack and its the perfect homage for a 50 former drummer wife kids job blablabla who hasnt missed a tour since 2112 hells yes i am one of many many phx voices on their upcoming bluray cant remember the effete critic early on who dissed the album as sloppy and crushed  wadda flush texas mickey just buy the actual cd immediately if not sooner not that compressed mp3 crap and listen to it loud|1
i think the music is very inspiring and i have been a flyleaf fan for a few yearshowever when i received the new cd  dvd 2 disc set i noticed the song titles on the back of cd cover and on the actual cd  dvd have several letters that are double typed  was this done on purpose for some type of design effect or was it just a shotty print job  if it was a shotty print job ya think someone at octone  am records would have seen it before they shipped out thousands of the sets|1
please note to get instead the new great sounding capitol 2007 release which has all 24 songs includes both volumes 1  2 plus one bonus and is very reasonably priced this is the disappointing 10 song abbreviated version the 2006 version has a recording flaw this is a classic christmas album that should be fully enjoyed and the 2007 is the best version out there|0
this is one of the best albums of all time pink floyd adresses everything lyrically from childhood war education love heartbreak nervous breakdown etc some of pink floyds finest songs such as run like hell comfortably numb and young lust are on this album|1
fine music like a fine meal can be ruined by a poor presentation the lark ascending is a most gorgeous violin piece too bad you cant hear the violin first the high frequencies are seriously attenuated you can barely hear poor hagai shagams opening soaring violin noteeven at lower and louder pitched tones the violin loses its singing quality you hear the wood but not the strings to compound the sonic felonies the orchestra comes in much louder than the violin drowning it outim not qualified to comment on the quality of the performances shagam certainly sounds fine all the more frustrating that hes denied centerpiece due to careless mastering there are many offerings of this material keep shopping|0
clockwork angels seems to be some of rushs strongest material in quite some time  while not as strong as their heyday i believe it will please both old and new fans alike  the songwriting and performances seems more energetic and geddys bassplaying is absolutely stellar  my favorites include the title track caravan headlong flight and the garden  my biggest complaint is that the guitar parts could be more prominent in the mix at times|1
after taking a very close look at the cd identification area near the centre circle and the overall look and feel of the cd and the packaging i have come to the conclusion that the poor sound quality lies in the fact that this is actually a knockoff cdr probably from an eastern european location  i did further checks online and discovered mlps for the beatles catalogue were never released at the dates this release claims to be from and the later releases certainly were not done individually but only in complete box sets which a good friend of mine showed me and his version of the mlps of this album does not even remotely look like his genuine article  still i found some use for this as i kept the mlps which overall is still decentlooking and replaced the disc with the latest digipak remasters as i like those cds but despise the flimsy digipak packaging  this way i get the best of both worlds with a decent enough mlps packaging coupled with a decentsounding cd of one of my favourite beatles albums of all timeunless you intend to use this product the way i did though you may want to thoroughly reconsider buying this item unless of course you dont mind knockoffs|0
all i can say is disappointing  some of the songs seem to have similar drum lines and instrumentals from previous songs  i would have to say that this is their worst album to date so much for 20|0
as i sat on a train bound for illinois in november of 1989 i couldnt wait to listen and see what mws would do on a christmas album  at first i  was so surprised at what i found but after listening to it over a dozen  times while on that train trip i realized that this was some of the best  christmas music i had ever heard i couldnt stop listening  it captures  your heart and transports you to another time and place of christmas  past it infact does sound like an awesome movie soundtrack and i remember  him saying back when this was released that he wanted to compose movie  soundtracks this was maybe his first shot at it due to the overwhelming  quality of music on this cd mws may be under using his  unbelievable  talent and i beg of someone to offer him the opportunity  i also wish  michael would do more recordings like this you will enjoy this  masterpiece and not just at christmastime  be prepared to have a  wonderful experience listening to this some of his very best work|1

this is a disappointing collection scatman crothers only performs 4 songs on this whole disc and they are recent numbers not pieces from his cotton club heydaylikewise the cab calloway material this is cab in the 1970s imitating sammy davis jr doing show tunes and vegas lounge numbers an entirely forgettable performance its not terrible but the title is terribly misleading neither artist ever sounded like this at the cotton clubwhat was laserlight thinkingoh they were thinking they could get away with it avoid this release|0
in 1967 brel stopped doing concert tours giving rise to the title of this offbroadway revue based on his songs which opened jan 22 1968 at the village gate in greenwich village new york and giving rise 27 years later to this revival cast in londonunfortunately many of these songs translated just a phrase or two from the original brel song and then went on to write entirely new lyrics that went far afield of brels original songs and lacked the stunning poetic beauty and raw emotional power of the original songsi believe the glowing references to mort shuman and eric blaus translations given elsewhere on amazoncom were written by people who dont know much french and were not very familiar with the original songs what this revue amounts to is a set of english songs that may have been inspired by brel but bear little relation to the powerful poetic songs brel wrotethat the village gate ny production was very successful in its own right 2000 performances is perhaps a testament to the wit and abilities of the shumanblau team however both the new york and the london revival performances leave the knowledgeable brel fan hugely disappointed and they leave englishspeaking audiences with a very distorted view of what brels lyrics and music were really likemuch better english translations of 40 brel songs were published last year with the release of a new 2disc compilation infiniment but be careful because only the 2004 release on drg records contains the translation not the 2003 release on universal the asin number for the drg release with english translations is b0002puhgu wonderful albeit abridged translations as well as a minibio of brel in the liner notes were created by amazoncom reviewer thelma f blitzstill more great english translations by thelma blitz were released in the liner notes of drg records olympia 61 and 64 asin b000bj7d96 a 2cd collection of brels songs sung in his own inimitable way in frenchfor those who wish to use the original french songs to improve their knowledge of french i recommend the book of all his french lyrics jacques brel oeuvre integrale isbn 222101068x or 8 or tout brel isbn 2264033711 and a terrific frenchenglish dictionary to use in studying brels chansons is the collinsrobert french dictionary complete  unabridged isbn 000718381xsome truly excellent brel cds sung by him in french that you can find on amazoncom aretitle asin no of songsinfiniment on the drg label asin b0002puhgu 40 songs 2cd set with wonderful english translationsolympia 61 and 64 asin b000bj7d96 30 songs 2cd set with great english translationsquand on na que lamour asin b00000iyc9 49 songs 3cd setgrand jacques asin b0009ndddy or b0000akol8 15 songs including the rare and lovely sur la placevol 1special edition asin b000042off 16 songsles flamandes asin b000006uoa 21 songsles bonbons asin b0000akold 14 songsballades et mots damour asin b00003q56t 30 songsgrand jacques integrale 172 titres asin b000025bd8 172 songs 10cd setwhats even more fabulous than the cds however is the 3 volume dvd set released in 2003 jacques brel comme quand on etait beau asin b0000aqjpr the set includes 75 hours of live and staged performances as well as interviews and home video footage everything that the heart of a jacques brel fan desires to capture the essence of this very theatrical artist in a way that an audio only recording can notalso of tremendous interest the vhs video jacques brel asin b0001p1xg4 a video biography on the life and music of jacques brel this full length documentary features extensive live footage and interviews with brel himself as well as his daughter and associates it is also available on dvd but only from films media groupmy advice buy some of these french cds above perhaps infiniment or olympia 61 and 64 if you need the english translations andor the 3 dvd set if youre really nuts about brel as i am|0
flyleafs selftitled debut seems promising in the tight structure of the songs and the catchiness of the melodies in them for the most part this cd is somewhere between poppy metal and more melodic rock the guitars work excellently together at creating heavy riffs that sound catchy at the same time their lead singer is a female so some of the songs have a more gentle sound to them like the ballad there for you and the somewhatawkward so i thought they know how to write a catchy song though and mixing the hooks with the occasional heavymetal scream and grinding guitars works very effectively on almost every song downsides the frontwomans voice can get too lulling at a few points as if shes trying to sing you to sleep that really grinds the songs to a halt also the best songs are far too short and the entire cd is only 33 minutes long thats not quite enough to make it great since i got the impression they were afraid expand theirselves musically i noticed that the lead singers voice basically controls the album i thought the musicians could have stepped into the forefront a bit more for the most part though the entire album is a catchy listen that should please both metal and pop fans|1

i have several lps and cassette tapes of roger whittaker the recordings on this cd do not have the fullness or richness of whittakers voice anyone thinking these recordings sound great would be shocked at how bad this cd is if they heard earlier perhaps non bmg recordings also the cadence of several of the recordings doesnt match the earlier recordings and the changes are for the worse i must wonder if the recordings on this cd were mastered from mp3 or aac apple downloads and then run through an audio enhancement program in an attempt to compensate for all the information ie quality lost when using these and all other compression codecs note normalcommercial quality cds use aiff encoding and this encoding loses far less informationquality  also whatever happened to the aad add and ddd markings on cdif you want to hear the real roger whittaker and he is great this cd doesnt come close|0
this is an atrocious rehash of the beach boys christmas album with only nine of the twelve songs presented out of order with no liner notes and poor sound quality to boot get the official christmas album instead or better yet get the ultimate christmas cd which has the entire christmas album plus lots of bonus tracks with three times the playing time and with fantastic sound quality compared to this sad cdi hope you have a merry christmaspeace on earth good will toward men and women|0
it is very rare for me to find a cd that i can play the whole way through and enjoy and this is one of them  i love this cd|1
die hard with a vengeance is unfortunate enough to have pretty the absolute worst score cd of any movie ever made im afraid to say its just a complete disaster from top to bottomfirst of all the track listings are not on the cover or the insert so its a big of a con if you pick the cd in the stores considering you cannot even see what exactly it is that you are getting the tracks themselves are rather cryptically named after things that did not appear in the movie iron foundry waltz of the bankers what second there are awful and very dated rap tunes littered about the cd even though they only appear in the film for a few seconds each third only a tiny tiny portion of kamens music makes it to the cd what we get is a few tracks of underscore with the main action cues completely absent what the hell is the point in creating a score cd that represents the strength of the film in no way whatsoeverthe brilliant johnny comes marching home music missing the bomb in the subway music missing the car chase music missing the final reveal of the bomb music missing the showdown music missing the only action track we get is the scene when mcclane surfs the dump truck and even that is different from its equivalent in the moviemichael kamen did two scores for this movie his first was rejected by john mctiernan in favor of repeated themes from the first movies so when you think about it theres probably about 2hours worth of music for die hard 3 out there that aint getting the cd release it deserves maybe someone like intrada or varese sarabanda can pick this up for a limited release because this rca release is an effing disgrace|0
the beach boys create some great christmas music  but this is not a real album  its a budget cd compilation and not from capitol records  buy ultimate christmas  you get the original 1964 christmas album in its entiriety plus great extra tracks from the unreleased 1977 album and others|0

really good album from slash  some great guitar playing i knew going into this that it would be very hard to beat the last album just because it was so good the last album is more like a slash  friends album with there being so many different singers on the album the music changed from song to song to fit with what the singers could do it gave a feel like you were listening to a rock station with so many great singers on it that are being played on rock radio right now this is a different beast this is a band album and this is like a new slash band the album is very good slash is really playing great he has a few years of touring back under his belt and it shows that he is not taking breaks and is back in the flow of playing everyday best guitar work  tone slash has had since the use your illusion albumsgreat cd as a band album its better then velvet revoler was in every way the bonus tracks are even great songs its more of a guns n roses album then you have with axl roses new fake guns n rosesthe axl rose band slash is not out to make money the man just wants to have fun  play for us fans  im one of them  im so glad he is playing for us again|1
2012s clockwork angels is the new concept album from the legendary canadian band rush it is the bands nineteenth studio album of original material twentieth if you count the covers album feedback and follows up their last two albums in bringing out the more hard rockmetal aspects of their sound it takes snakes and arrows variety and vapor trails power and combines them into a very strong album indeed one that isnt ever dull or plodding the story that it tells is also available separately as a novelif you have already heard caravan and bu2b which were released a full two years earlier than the record was then you should have some idea of this albums musical direction already the songs have since been rerecorded to fit in better with the rest of the album though so even if youve played them to death already you wont feel cheated that they are part of the albumdespite concentrating on the bands heavier side the album is still very dynamic and varied sometimes things will be melodic and sweet sometimes there are synths and keys in there sometimes youll hear little touches that remind you of hemispheres and a farewell to kings and then of course sometimes youll hear more of the direction from snakes and arrows and vapor trails heavier moments the opening to carnies even has a big fat riff that could almost fit on a monster magnet or down albumeach song on clockwork angels contains a lot of different parts you could hear a funklike break down in one track an acoustic intro in another some proggy feedback scrapes in another and straight rock beats in yet another or you could hear all of that and more within one single trackhighlights include the closing track the garden which opens with acoustic guitars and has a grand orchestral feel in places as well as the amazing single headlong flight which mixes variety with focused hard rocking similar in a way to far cry off the last album but with more parts packed into it and the fun track the anarchist that really takes off in a neat passage that revolves around tomrollingas a general rule i always find that the best rush songs are the ones where a lot of time has passed without you knowing it for example a fiveminute track that feels like it is only twoandahalf minutes long and the worst ones were the ones where a lot of time passes without enough ideas used to justify the song lasting as long as it actually does for example a sixminute track that could have worked a lot better as a three minute songthe best thing about the whole clockwork angels album for me personally is that every song justifies its own length when this plus is added to the superb musical direction i prefer the bands heavier side personally the superb production and the asalways superb musical and vocal talent on display it makes for an absolutely captivating record that hits hard on first listen and has a lot more to offer on subsequent spins as wellthen on top of that you have the interesting steampunk story to get to grips with across each early listen which just adds yet further intrigue and replay value it would be tempting to say that this is almost guaranteed to be loved by any rush fan but then you have to consider that their audience is so wide and diverse and their catalogue is so varied that pleasing any one type of fan may cost another type of fan to loose interestif you are an earlyprog or synthpop fan first and a rush fan second however if you hated vapor trails and the heavier parts of snakes and arrows and are generally the type of person who hates all metal then clockwork angels may not be for you i can see how it may be leaning a little heavily on one aspect of their sound and that maybe thats the one part of rushs style that you dont personally enjoy maybe even the conceptual nature of the record or the variety within each track isnt enough to save it for you if you simply dont like rush when they get all loud and distorted if this describes you then my advice would be that maybe you ought to give this one a missotherwise however this is a pretty essential album and no matter the size of your rush collection this should probably be a part of itin summary clockwork angels is a strong and fresh album it is energetic entertaining and focused it is heavy rather often and has enough ideas per song to justify each songs length it just sounds vital and has enough depth to reward repeat listens overall its a pretty topnotch release and its definitely something you should consider getting if you like rush especially if you like their heavier side|1
i love this cd i listen to it almost everyday  it is packed with so many meaningful messages and roger waters is a musical genius  nothing ever will be like the wall  this is a must buy floyd fans rock on|1
after putzing around with keyboards and other sounds in the last 25 years they are finally returning to their roots  story driven hardedged prog rock even so they continue to advance incorporating orchestral backgrounds in a few of the songs that add a softer finish to the ballads yes  i see that as progress  it is progressive rock yet all the rush staples are there  the complex rhythms thoughtprovoking intelligent lyrics signature alex guitars it is refreshing to continue to see these guys so comfortable with each other and their music after all these years|1
depending on ones mood this is either one of the finest albums ever recorded or an overambitious selfobsessed claustrophobiainducing morass of sound in reality it is both totally apart from any other pink floyd  record  although their previous album animals set the pace for  it  this is almost ninety minutes of pink floyd music the increasingly  mussolinilike figure of roger waters resulted in his nasal tones replacing  the more mellifluous voice of guitarist david gilmour on almost all the  songs whilst keyboardist richard wrights voice is completely absent from  this album indeed such was bassist waters dissatisfaction with wrights  playing on this album his marriage had recently broken up so his mind was  on other things that he issued the organist with an ultimatum at the end  of the sessions he was to leave the band or else waters would not sanction  the release of the album wright wasnt about to call waters bluff and he  actually left the band before the records completion sessionman freddie  mandell was drafted in to play on the albums opener in the  flesh and its counterpart in the flesh wright returned  to the fold when pink floyd took the wall on the road in 1980  but it was a musician on a wage rather than as a member of the band  interband wranglings plagued the whole project indeed roger waters is  the only member of pink floyd to appear on every song on the album as  drummer nick mason was replaced by jeff porcaro on  mother and david gilmour does not feature on some of the more  orchestrated pieces on the second disc of the album them from the  discoesque another brick in the wall part two to the heavy  metal pastiche young lust from the hammy gilbert and  sullivanstyled operetta the trial to the folky  mother however as roger waters subsequent solo work attests  the lyrics here are of primary importance the story such as it is  concerns a rock star called pink floyd who after undergoing the trauma  of losing his father in world war ii is mentally abused by sadistic  schoolmasters an overbearing mother and an unfaithful wife this causes  him to construct a wall around himself protecting himself from  the outside world he is in this catatonic state when it is time for him to  perform at one of his concerts unable to take the stage in such a stupor  he is drugged by a doctor so that he can perform detailed in  comfortably numb arguably pink floyds finest moment but  when he reaches the stage he mistakes the crowd for a fascist rally and  behaves accordingly leading them through the streets of london on a racist  spree of destruction at the last moment pinks latent conscience kicks in  and he is put on trial in front of his peers his sentence to  tear down the wall this being done pink can finally see the ones who  genuinely care for him but the album closes with the phrase isnt  this where which links up with the opening of the album the words  we came in this applies the building of the wall to  everyman making the project universal heavyhandedly approximate  today this album will have something for everybody who is into rock  music best listened to as with all good albums from start to finish on  headphones this album represents the pinnacle of roger waters  acheivements while 1983s the final cut was sonically similar  and melodically it recycled leftover songs from the wall  waters moroseness had reached its zenith and the album may be considered  overly personal he left pink floyd soon after and considered the band  a spent force creatively when messrs gilmour and mason  regrouped to record under the pink floyd moniker enlisting richard wright  and the walls producer bob ezrin to assist waters took them  to court over the usage of the name the bitter and lengthy dispute that  ensued did nothing for either side except make them loathe one another  pink floyd now peddle a watereddown equivalent of their mid1970s work  sorely missing waters lyrical bite while waters continues to pen  increasingly elaborate concept works only on 1992s superb amused to  death has he come close to emulating the best of his work with pink  floyd although his 1990 revival of the wall with guest  musicians although no other members of pink floyd at the fall of the  berlin wall was one of the rock spectacles of the century whilst egoism  and stubbornness backstabbing and the building of the kind of personal  walls this album warns about have blighted pink floyds postthe  wall career irrepairably in the wall itself pink floyd  have created one of the alltime great rock albums along with the  piper at the gates of dawndark side of the moon and  wish you were here this is a pink floyd album no  selfrespecting rock connessieur should be without|1
its easy to slag pink floyd for the megadinosaurs they later became but the wall was immensely important just like london calling released the same year not because it symbolized late70s culture but because it was an open indictment of it  whereas london callings targets were external the wall was internal a confessional strengthened by the very fragments you criticize working on levels simultaneously dreamlike and harshly realisticthe previous generation had or ignored lennons plastic ono band  ours had to scrounge for our truth finding it in the punk streets of london ny and la and from one huge rock act that courageously chose to turn in on itself and on its very sustenance namely the corporate monster that rock had becometrent reznor radiohead mgmt the smashing pumpkins all of these artists praised the lifechanging influence the wall had on them and the power of their own work attests to the same  the wall was a revelation largely because it was not boringly perfecta doublealbum of psychotic fragments in slick 79  how radical is that|1

the arrangement and performance are very good and are representative of argentine performers of the period 19201940 the audio engineering is superb now if someone would make a similar recordingof the performance style of 19001920 using violin bandoneon and flute to provide the melody and guitar strumming the habanera rhythm 1xx45x7x used in early tangos  track 2 on this cd was used inthe movies scent of a woman and true lies  the only other tango cds with superb performances are flawed stanley blacks has the trebel turned up because the studio speakers were weak in trebel james lasts has overblown mixing and reverb and sounds like it comes from outer space or from inside your head not a live performance the old performances copied from edison drums or 78 rpm records are good but the sound is not modern arrangements for string orchestra are apropriate if not authenticbut performances by swing bands are no more appropriate for tango than perfomance on a pipe organ|0
this alblum is amazing  it sucks you in with the first song and keeps the riffs going  this is the only other band besides evanesance that can pull off a heavy metal female lead  if you like hawthorne heights senses fail evanesance or incubus this is the alblum for you  i cannot wait to got see them live|1
skip it pure and simple the four tracks should have been released as an ep because then the perception of this particular portion of the beatles  music would have been different really its just an ep dressed up and the originally plan was to release this and across the universe as a 5 song  minidisc they should have stuck with that plan while sir george martins score does deserve more credit it would have been much more  appropriate had it been released on a disc all its own dont but this go with the yellow submarine songtrack just recently released in  conjunction with the vhs is it on dvd too i dont know version of yellow submarine that album works more as an introduction to the  beatles body of work mid career and it has the four songs here the beatles werent very involved with either the cartoon or this album or the  songtrack for that matter and it shows its the only time harrison wrote 50 of the new material on the album sadly its still only two songsof the four songs the only real unessential is all together now which is a childrens singalong song with an inappropriate reference for the age  group it sounds aimed at about going to bed only a northern song is a cynical snide saying no matter what the beatles do everyone loves them  and its only a northern song it was one of the beatles music publishing companies probably a subsideary of apple sounds more like lennon with  his adamant objections of mythifying the beatles all to much is a very long song for the beatles clocking in at over 6 minutes good stuff lennon  turns in a nasty hey bulldogremember all these are available on the new songtrack skip this one|0

if youre expecting the sound of a thunderstorm forget it what you get with this cd is the sound of constant static and intermittent thunder the thunder is pretty good and at the very beginning and end you get some assorted bird noises but the rain what a mess static nothing but static and it doesnt even vary to try and pretend its rain  frankly if id wanted static i could tune my radio to it for free skip this one|0

counsel of the holy tries to tug tears from my eyes i resist but first i am weary of trying to identify which of the john schlitt era petra albums cd is my favorite they all are they brilliantly capture the 70s 80s arena rock era sound with unmasked praise of the almighty god no veiled lyrics here david and the giants giantworldcom and petrajohn schlitt are the only dependable bands to put out songs that guarantee i will be able to listen to them over and over and over if it says david and the giants or petrajohn schlitt on the jacket buy it  on fire is one of best just awesome|1

take a cue from the album cover illustration  this is not a traditional reverential choral christmas album i didnt like it and i dont think its one of percy faiths best at all even in the category of more jaunty christmas albums from that era its not even half as good as ray conniffs we wish you a merry christmas albumim just saying know what you are buying when you order this preview the music note the illustration and make your decisions accordingly|0

everything that has been written so far is true this was indeed biggies finest hour what you should know is that aside from the bonus dvd and the inclusion of who shot ya and just playin dreams there is no additional material compared to the original the sticker on the front says remixed and remastered and the description on amazoncom says rmx but none of the key remixes that originated from ready to die are included what a shame over the years we have come to know and love the smooth remix of one more chance featuring faith on vocals as well as the bangin club remix aka one more chance hip hop mix big poppa also received an excellent remix treatment when it was released as a single these are the versions that we remember as classics  not the original versions how hard would it have been to include these remixes as part of this package theres plenty of space left on the bonus discfor the reason listed above the album retains its 5 star rating in my books but this particular remastered release gets a 2 star rating from me if you have the original ready to die there is little reason to get this|0

rfnr the predecessor to apocalyptic love was a fantastic album  apocalyptic love continues in the slash tradition of powerful melodies energetic solos and memorable riffs  one of the songs from the album anastasia really demonstrates the musical diversity that makes up slashs signature style  myles kennedy sings on the entire album to my great delight  he brings the energy of axl with the nonfalsetto range of plant in a stunning performance  i was glad to see slash include him on the entire album  apocalyptic love is reintroducing rock n roll to a society that has become apathetically accustomed to basic power chords and blaze vocal performances  add this to your collection|1
i told an old coworker i was having trouble sleeping and he suggested a thunderstorm cd so i could relax  he copied his cd and i have used it for many yearstoo many years and it finally died  he left the company and i had no idea what the cd was called  i have been searching for the best cd of thunderstorms ever since  i purchased electrifying thunderstorms hoping this was the cd i fell asleep to every night  boy was i wrong  my husband and i almost jumped out of bed because the thunder was magnified so much it was jarring  also if you turned down the volume you could not hear the rain  it was horrible and it was quite fake  i would not recommend this cd at all|0

not only is this a great second album by a true supergroup but the packaging of the vinyl edition is awesome i have not seen the disc version but the 3d effect of the vinyl edition is some of the best i have seen and the bookletgatefold and sleeves all are cool as helll if you like the first album i recommend this as it may be a little more mature but still plenty of excellent guitar work from satch i saw them live in 2009 and am glad they stuck together because they were jaw dropping and this album does not disappoint|1
this seller missed an opportunity to replace or respond to my communique of a defective product it disappoints when a seller with amazon lacks the rigor required when a product isnt up to standard having owned this record and because i present a weekly jazz improvisational hiphop radio program i relished the opporutnity to finally have the compact discbut the seller to date has refused or simply failed to provide the level of customer service required here accountability is so critical and sadly while the seller is to be commended for the archive disrespects the music by not providing a response to my feed back that the product is defectivefreddie hubbard stanley turrentine herbie hancock jack dejohnnette and eric gale are great on this recording but my radio listeners will not experience the sound quality a compact disc can provide for this great concert performed by these phenomenal musiciansyugen aka the motif kboo 907fm sat 2pm to 5pm portland oregon 503 2318187|0
wow wow wow rush really hit the nail on the head with this one snakes and arrows their last record was without a doubt a truly superb album but this one is by far their best album in 20 years stand out track bu2b acronym for brought up to believe this is one awesome concept album by the fab 3 thumbs up all the way im sure this will go down as one of their landmark records crank it up|1
i cannot imagine a more sloppy recording of these two masterpieces i had to get rid of the cd after the first hearing  it was simply too embarrassing to have in my collectionfor the nielsen concerto go to emil telmanyi and the royal orchestra conducted by tango on danacord the sibelius has several good recordings my favourite is ferras with the bpo and karajan sibelius himself said about karajan that he was the only conductor who really understood his music|0
if you already own the wall this remastering is still a must  the clarity and depth is amazing  i put it on at work that was a mistake  i had to drop everything and just listen to things ive never heard all  these years this new recording takes advantage of the separate subwoofers  on todays systems if you ever wondered exactly what the teacher is  screaming or the actors on the background tv are really saying you  should listen to this  all the songs take on a new life  i thought i was  listening to it for the first time  does anyone know if they did as good a  job with of the dvd movie of the wall coming out on oct 19th|1
i was actually looking for the soundtrack of the movie fools rush in where can i find that at|0
this is the last cd from michael w smith that i consider a must have  the music from this album is deep rooted  into my memories of growing up  if i could thank him i would say thank you for years of great encouraging music  so many lyrics are about putting other people down  it was so good to hear songs telling me i was not alone on my journeyim so thankful to amazon for having a great selection and great shipping  even to canada|1
after the departure of syd barrett in 1968 pink floyds two driving forces were lyricistbassplayerconceptualizer roger waters and guitaristcomposer david gilmour so it was inevitable that the first pink floyd album without waters 1987s a momentary lapse in reason was going to essentially be gilmours third solo effort the only question was how badly gilmour obviously only wishing to keep the attention and revenue drummed up from the pink floyd logo would tarnish bands name if only he had kept the sober wintery feel of his two previous solo works then perhaps momentary lapse could have been a somewhat decent album but no like so many of his aging peers gilmour along with drummer nick mason producer bob ezrin and a small army of session musicians had to pander to in the super slick mindlessly sanguine yuppie style of that utter waste of a decade 1980s on the turning away and the dogs of war call up that horrid decades flaky unconvincing social consciousness one slip is a boring overintellectualized ballad like those of tears for fears signs of life and terminal frost replace the warm lush surrealism of floyds earlier sound with drippy new age music the ultrasynthetic sound with its obligatory guitar solos and deep drum indents brings guilty pleasure at best and nostalgia for a decade hence at worst the album would be a total waist if not for learning to fly and sorrow on these fantastic tracks gilmours guitar throws around some serious muscle and nicely leads the thickly layered sound into a sense of fanciful electric splendor without these two however a momentary lapse of reason is just another throwaway album from one more band coasting on reputation and catering to a new unexciting adult contemporary audience|0
the last album i bought i got an mp3 download of the album i thought that was part of having a prime account when i bought this album and didnt get an mp3 download also i am extremely disappointed|0
i know many long term fans like myself have been rather confused by rushs recent albumssimply this is their best album since counterparts test for echo vapor trails and snakes and arrows were all substandard albums fatally dull sadly not quite sure what happened but the guys were inspired on this one and made a great collection of songs i had all but given up on them but this album has certainly restored the faithi do hope they play the whole thing on tourfor those on the fence i can confirm that as a longterm grumpy fan this one is a winner|1
i love the movie the big blue and loved the music so much that i made many calls to la from georgia before i finally found someone with the soundtrack  imagine my dissapointment when i popped in the tape and  started listening toothe wrong music  after doing some research i  found out that the soundtrack was the one to the original foreign film  however the soundtrack was completely rewritten from scratch by bill conti  for the us version  why the decision was made to not release this version  as a soundtrack ill never understand  ive been looking for it for years  and its just not available  if anyone knows where i can find it let me  know please  the foreign film soundtrack is okay but no where near as  mystical and  beautiful as bill contis score  i would recommend buying a  wonderful new age piece of music rather than this foreign film  version of the big blue soundtrack|0
