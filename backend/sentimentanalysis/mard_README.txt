MARD: Multimodal Album Reviews Dataset

MARD contains texts and accompanying metadata originally obtained from a much larger dataset of Amazon customer reviews collected by Julian McAuley, and enriched with music metadata from MusicBrainz, and audio descriptors from AcousticBrainz. MARD amounts to a total of 65,566 albums and 263,525 customer reviews.


The dataset contains 2 files: 

mard_metadata.json: In this file there is an entry per album. Depending on the album, the following fields may be available or not. The list of possible fields per entry:

acousticbrainz_descriptors/ This folder contains one file per album with the audio descriptors of its first track. In the folder, each filename has the format amazonid_mbid.json. Using the song mbid, it is possible to get all other album songs related acoustic descriptors from the AcousticBrainz web service. The number of songs with information in AcousticBrainz is constantly growing, so the numbers indicated in the Table represents the availability in the moment of the dataset creation. 


mard_reviews.json The file containing the reviews text with some metadata associated to each review. Each entry has the following fields: reviewerID, product-id, reviewerName, helpful, reviewText, overall, summary, unixReviewTime, reviewTime. 

Each line in these 2 files is a json dictionary. To load the file you must read a line and then eval the json expression. Python code example: 

fname = "mard_metadata.json" 
with open(fname, 'r') as f: 
    for line in f: 
        data = eval(line)
